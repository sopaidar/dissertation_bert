With this uptick in persons with dementia (PWD), managing dementia-induced agitation, a behavior present in 90 precent of PWD characterized by physical aggression, verbal outburst, or other troubling behavior, is a pressing issue [1]. Caregiver burden associated with agitation is one of the leading causes a community-based PWD is institutionalized [2], so by supporting PWD-caregiver dyads, we improve individual quality of life and relieve stress placed on the global healthcare system. Use of AI technology, big data, and integrated networks of wearable and ambient sensors has enabled continuous monitoring of dementia care. However, most methods focus on data collection at the early stages of dementia. More research is needed on how novel technologies can empower PWD and their caregivers to take action to manage agitation and support them in the long term as symptoms progress. Moreover, current methods have not taken full advantage of the information obtained and do not provide personalized care. In this paper, we use the Universal Village (UV) perspective to evaluate the current status of smart technologies with the potential for use in preventing and mitigating agitation while providing support to the caregiver. We conduct evaluations based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that a robust PWD agitation management system should take into consideration the interaction between the smart healthcare system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart response system for city emergency, smart environmental protection and smart humanity, and also study how managing agitation would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study will help us explore in depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design. As such, the novel framework will improve PWD quality of life and reduce the care burden for formal and informal caregivers through continuous, unobtrusive monitoring, life-long agitation management throughout different stages of dementia, PWD-caregiver dyad-specific guidance, preventive healthcare, and timely treatment.', 'In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of smart cities have brought about significant advancements in various fields, including medicine. The integration of IoT devices and smart city infrastructure has transformed domains like e-government, e-learning, and ehealth. In particular, the field of e-health, which combines medical informatics, public health, and information technology, has witnessed extensive research to analyze the vast amounts of data generated by these connected systems. This data, often referred to as big data, poses challenges in terms of storage, analysis, visualization, and processing due to its complexity and diversity. The emergence of big data analytics has revolutionized management practices, including healthcare, and offers promising opportunities for progress. By leveraging data analysis techniques and optimizing the architecture of healthcare systems within the context of IoT and smart cities, numerous benefits can be achieved. These include cost reduction, early detection of epidemics, and improved quality of life for individuals. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of fundamental concepts, architectural considerations, and challenges in utilizing big data for e-health and healthcare within the context of IoT and smart cities. By fostering a deeper understanding of data-driven approaches for better healthcare outcomes, it seeks to contribute to further advancements in this field.', 'Applications of Big Data to smart cities are nearly limitless. However, challenges emerged with handling data with new magnitude of dimensionality, heterogeneity, required processing timeliness, and the lack of reported development experiences on how to turn Big Data into Smart Data may hinder the adoption of Big Data technologies in delivering smarter city services.This paper reports our experience in developing a Smart Big Data-centric software platform for tracking city performance. Here we examine how to design such a platform by exploiting architectural styles and open source technology for Big data management. We describe the actual development of an instance of it, the PELL Smart City Platform, for processing and managing urban data in the domain of public lighting. In particular, we focus on the formulation and evaluation of key performance indicators related to energy consumption to derive Smart Data from Big Data in the context of public street lighting.']"

Due to the complexity of the changing farm ecosystem, the new technological revolution's benefits will not be shared evenly. It is necessary to understand the problems and challenges that need to be addressed so that all countries fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0. This study aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by identifying descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages. Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study's findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0. Besides, research helps broaden the inclusive debate that can shape the introduction of agriculture 4.0."", 'CONTEXT This research paper details the response to a central challenge of the digitalization of agricultural systems which stems from information overload and the broad heterogeneity of agricultural technologies and the classification thereof. It is the result of four years of effort on the Horizon 2020 SmartAgriHubs (SAH) project, whose purpose was the development and connection of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) and Competence Centres (CCs) related to the agricultural sector in Europe. CCs form the backbone of DIHs and provide the digital technological infrastructure by offering advanced technical expertise, access to the latest knowledge and information on digital technologies, and other technological and scientific infrastructure. However, the lack of a general framework for technology classification in agriculture needed to be remedied, not only to specifically advance the general aim of SmartAgriHubs and DIHs to “connect the dots”, but in general, so as to facilitate a broad range of actors involved in digitalisation of agriculture. OBJECTIVE This paper sets out the conceptual framework for the classification of technologies in the agricultural sector, and the development of the “Agricultural Technology Navigator” (ATN) as an iterative tool for gathering and searching for information to support such classification, so that actors involved in the digitalization of agriculture may more easily find and communicate technologies related to digital solutions. METHODS A multi-actor, multi-disciplinary expert group was formed to identify technologies and define keywords. A literature, patent, foresights studies, and grey literature review was also carried out. Text mining techniques, using the JCR “Tool for Innovation Monitoring”, were used based on keywords selected by experts for documents analysis (+170,000,000 publications; + 22,000,000 patent applications; + 77,000 projects). Gaps in previous studies were identified to form the basis upon which to create a new classification system. Taking into account the fact that technologies are continually developing and evolving, an iterative approach was also necessary. To this end, a new tool was developed, compatible with agricultural supply chains, to gather “bottom up” information from CCs (and other actors) on innovative digital technologies and solutions. RESULTS And Conclusions The main results of all the publications, patents and projects summarized herein, provide a scientifically sound foundation for a much-needed classification of digital technologies used in agriculture. This paper analyses different dimensions or categories in which the diverse technologies can be classified and selects the most appropriate classification to describe the technologies which could be used and managed by CCs and other agricultural actors, in offering and searching for systems and competences which provide digital solutions. SIGNIFICANCE Given the importance of DIHs and CCs, and more recently European DIHs (EDIHs), in the European agricultural policy agenda and the development of the sustainable digitalization of agriculture, it is necessary to have a mechanism to appropriately classify digital technologies relevant for agriculture so that providers and users can “match-make” and easily offer, find, and decide on relevant digital tools and solutions. CCs are not the only entities that benefit from such classification. A diverse range of actors involved in the sustainable digitalisation of agriculture, such as technology companies, farm advisors, machinery and other input suppliers who develop and deal in novel and different technology innovations, can benefit from being able to describe appropriately their technologies as part of agricultural systems and solutions.', 'To achieve the highest levels of agricultural production, it is first necessary to fully understand the information underpinning complex agricultural systems. This can be achieved through the use of the latest monitoring technology which can generate a constant stream of data concerning the agricultural environment in quantities hitherto unseen. When these data are analyzed, farmers and government advisors are able to use the information to guide adjustments in their activities to enhance productivity. While this kind of approach has been widespread in many industrial sectors, Thai agriculture has not yet seen its implementation on a wide scale. This may partly explain the economic successes in industry while agriculture has lagged behind, especially in terms of worker remuneration. One further problem is that a majority of farmers do not have the education required to take advantage of technology and data analysis. This study therefore seeks to establish a framework to support the use of data analytics in the agricultural context, through the development of a web-based application capable of displaying performance data in farming and thus solving the key issues in the agricultural sector to support farmers. The framework will apply a number of software solutions to support agricultural production across various disciplines. The information provided will assist farmers in managing their operations, and will guide government departments in creating policies and plans for Thai agriculture in order to develop a modern and efficient farming sector.']"

2,38,2_protection_privacy_law_data,"['protection', 'privacy', 'law', 'data', 'personal', 'data protection', 'eu', 'information', 'legal', 'right']","['This article examines the two major international data transfer schemes in existence today – the European Union (EU) model which at present is effectively the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules system (CBPR), in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). While IoT data ostensibly relates to things i.e. products and services, it impacts individuals and their data protection and privacy rights, and raises compliance issues for corporations especially in relation to international data flows. The GDPR regulates the processing of personal data of individuals who are EU data subjects including cross border data transfers. As an EU Regulation, the GDPR applies directly as law to EU member nations. The GDPR also has extensive extraterritorial provisions that apply to processing of personal data outside the EU regardless of place of incorporation and geographical area of operation of the data controller/ processor. There are a number of ways that the GDPR enables lawful international transfer of personal data including schemes that are broadly similar to APEC CBPR. APEC CBPR is the other major regional framework regulating transfer of personal data between APEC member nations. It is essentially a voluntary accountability scheme that initially requires acceptance at country level, followed by independent certification by an accountability agent of the organization wishing to join the scheme. APEC CBPR is viewed by many in the United States of America (US) as preferable to the EU approach because CBPR is considered more conducive to business than its counterpart schemes under the GDPR, and therefore is regarded as the scheme most likely to prevail. While there are broad areas of similarity between the EU and APEC approaches to data protection in the context of cross border data transfer, there are also substantial differences. This paper considers the similarities and major differences, and the overall suitability of the two models for the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) in which large amounts of personal data are processed on an on-going basis from connected devices around the world. This is the first time the APEC and GDPR cross-border data schemes have been compared in this way. The paper concludes with the author expressing a view as to which scheme is likely to set the global standard.', 'With the rapid development and widespread use of digital technologies in the workplace in China, employers’ right to monitor and direct employees has often been abused, raising a number of disputes over the infringement of employees’ right to privacy in terms of their personal information. China must urgently develop an appropriate approach to balancing these two conflicting interests. However, there is currently no coherent and uniform regime governing the protection of employees’ personal information in China. The primary legal source on which employers can rely is the latest version of the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which offers three lawful bases for employers’ processing of their employees’ personal information. These bases are employee consent; “necessity for the conclusion or performance of an employment contract”; and “necessity for conducting human resource management.” Concerns have been expressed regarding the reasonableness and effectiveness of the three lawful bases under the PIPL. First, it is both legally and practically problematic for the PIPL to rely so heavily on employee consent. Second, it is unclear whether the other two lawful bases relieve employers of the duty of notification and, if so, how to safeguard employees’ right to know. Third, the ambiguous standard of “necessity” requires clarification. This article argues that China should adopt many elements from EU law, while US law should be only followed in relation to the standard of “necessity”. In relation to employee consent, the EU approach is preferable to the US approach. As the EU approach does not generally regard employees’ consent as a lawful basis for the processing of their information and uses the other two lawful bases as alternatives to employee consent, this approach better reflects the customary practices of employee subordination and employer control in China. In contrast, US law deems employee consent to be an absolute general defense to the tort of privacy violation and adopts an employer favoritism approach to balancing these two conflicting interests, which is not appropriate in the Chinese context. In relation to the scope of necessity, three tests taken from the EU and US approaches should be considered by the Chinese courts. In addition, when processing personal information based on the other two lawful bases, employers should safeguard employees’ right to know through collective contracts concluded with labor unions or employee representatives under the Chinese Labor Contract Law, which would effectively address employers’ arbitrariness. Ultimately, these changes would produce a better balance between employees’ right to privacy in terms of their personal information and employers’ need to subordinate and control employees.', ""The relationship between privacy protection and personal data protection is legally and academically challenging. The PRC's civil law has evolved from the traditional monism of privacy right provision (protecting personal information) to the dualism of separating privacy protection and personal information protection. But when the private information within the privacy sphere involves personal information, the dualism protection is not absolute, but more delicate than it has been suggested. More importantly, there is little in the existing literature analysing the noteworthy divergence of the protection path of privacy and personal information in civil law and criminal law – or considering the reasonable convergence of the protection path under the civil and criminal law. China's Criminal Law has sought to protect privacy with personal information provision for more than a decade. But it is presently difficult to convert privacy content into private information for personal information protection purposes. Given the multifaceted forms of contemporary privacy invasion and comparative law trends and thoughts, we seek to build a protection framework for privacy in the information age under the criminal law – and continually updating it – so as to make use of the expression function of coherence law theory to nurture a culture of respecting individual privacy and trusting legal protection in the information technology environment. The eventual convergence of dualism protection of personal data and privacy in both civil law and criminal law corresponds to the doctrinal coherence in the information age and to policy considerations in the digital economy and society. Privacy is by default an inalienable right to protect dignity and liberty – while personal information can be a comprehensive interest, which values and balances security and purpose, in accordance with law, in a specific jurisdiction such as contemporary China. The dualism exemplifies criminal law's coordination with civil law in protection.""]"

The sentiment computing of news event is a significant component of the social media big data. It has also attracted a lot of researches, which could support many real-world applications, such as public opinion monitoring for governments and news recommendation for Websites. However, existing sentiment computing methods are mainly based on the standard emotion thesaurus or supervised methods, which are not scalable to the social media big data. Therefore, we propose an innovative method to do the sentiment computing for news events. More specially, based on the social media data (i.e., words and emoticons) of a news event, a word emotion association network (WEAN) is built to jointly express its semantic and emotion, which lays the foundation for the news event sentiment computation. Based on WEAN, a word emotion computation algorithm is proposed to obtain the initial words emotion, which are further refined through the standard emotion thesaurus. With the words emotion in hand, we can compute every sentence's sentiment.

Many people use social networks to communicate and express their opinions in supporting or opposing different causes, with most of this user-generated content being textual information. As there are a lot of raw data of people posting real time messages about their opinions on a variety of topics in daily life, it is a worthwhile research endeavor to collect and analyze these data, which may be useful for government to make informed decisions or to monitor public opinion. Data available in social media is obviously only one type of information that can be of interest when trying to detect a possible terrorist or radical group, there are several cases for example in which the social media has been used by radical thinkers to act as influencers and encourage fanatics with the same radical views to take violent action. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for opinion mining and extremist content detection in on line social media data. Social media data targeted in this work to analyze, is the public text post on Facebook, the most popular social networking site. With this framework, machines can learn how to automatically extract the set of messages from Facebook public pages, using API graph calls, filter out non-opinion messages. determine their sentiment regarding the issue of interest directions (i.e. positive, negative) and detect violent or extremist content. The purpose of this model is to build a Big Data application that gets stream of public data from Facebook social network, which can help law enforcement and cybercrime analysts with analyzing and monitoring social media, in the search of digital trace of violence or radicalism, that can be exploited in further digital forensic investigation.']"

However, the literature remains fragmented, with researchers in social science disciplines like public administration and political science, and the fast-moving fields of AI, ML, and robotics, all developing concepts in relative isolation. Although there are calls to formalize the emerging study of AI in government, a balanced account that captures the full depth of theoretical perspectives needed to understand the consequences of embedding AI into a public sector context is lacking. Here, we unify efforts across social and technical disciplines by first conducting an integrative literature review to identify and cluster 69 key terms that frequently co-occur in the multidisciplinary study of AI.

Simultaneously, a series of urban development expressions, such as digital city, knowledge city, eco-city is used interchangeably with the smart city, significantly mystifying the reading of the concept. This paper, first argue that smart city interpretation needs and requires the input and contribution of the local stakeholders. The aim of this research is to provide an evidence-based framework to capture the perception of local urban actors in India vis-à-vis their interpretation of smart cities given the existing urban conditions and the proposed developments under the 100 Smart Cities Mission. This research also examines the underlying linkage between the smart city and its conceptual relatives and highlights the ones with a significant convergence with the emerging urban agenda in India's Smart Cities Mission. The analysis presented in this paper show that to emerge as a holistic concept, smart cities definition models should engage with the sustainability and community issues, beyond the use of digital technology. The research reveals that the Indian urban stakeholders strongly associate the smart city concept with sustainable city and eco-city, much more than the technology-loaded phrases such as ubiquitous city and digital city. The first-of-its-kind inclusive approach developed in this paper to define smart city takes on the monopolies of top-down smart city definitions and support the democratisation of the rapidly proliferating concept."", ""Smart city is to achieve efficient government management, convenient people's livelihood services and sustainable industrial development through the interconnection, comprehensive perception and information utilization ability of things, things and people, and the new generation of information technology such as internet of things, mobile internet and cloud computing. “Smart city” aims to use the new generation of information technology, change the way people interact, improve the real-time processing ability of information and the speed of sensing and response, enhance business flexibility and continuity, improve the efficiency of resource utilization, realize green energy saving, and promote the comprehensive and sustainable development of various social undertakings. From the content of smart city construction in each city, on the one hand, it is to strengthen the construction of urban basic communication network and improve the bandwidth and coverage of communication network. On the other hand, it is to provide smart application services in key areas, such as smart public services, smart social management, smart transportation, smart medical care, smart logistics, smart housing. Smart city is the only way to realize the sustainable development of the city. Smart city is the necessary stage for the development of urban informatization to wisdom. At the same time, in the process of building a smart city, it will also drive the overall development of related industries and become a new engine for economic transformation, industrial upgrading and urban upgrading. If we compare a smart city to a person, the internet of things is the sense organ, the mobile internet is the nerve, cloud computing is a strong body and heart, big data is a smart brain. If smart city leaves data collection, data analysis and data use, smart is empty talk. Big data is the key supporting technology for smart city to realize “intelligence” in all fields, and the construction of smart city can not do without big data. From government decision-making and services, to people's way of life, to the city's industrial layout and planning, to the city's operation and management mode, big data will spread in all aspects of the smart city, which will be “intelligent” under the support of big data. This paper uses conceptual model and multidisciplinary collaborative research methods to integrate innovative thinking led by big data into urban construction to help modernize social governance capacity and governance system.""]"

As information is being produced at a phenomenal scale and it is originating from every direction, such a monstrous measure of information makes enormous or complex informational indexes. These informational collections are known as Big Data. The blend of cloud and big data can be attributed to fresh IT (Information Technology) wave that is causing remarkable progress across IT departments of various industries. In this new environment of big data and cloud there are challenges associated with data storage as data are accumulating rapidly.With rapidly expansion of Big data requires government agencies to extract relevant data and make sense of it in order to make evidence-based policy decisions, with a focus on translating data into information and subsequently information into knowledge. The way to do this is to employ so-called big data analytics, which involves analyzing numerous data sets in order to reveal information such as specific patterns, correlations, and trends, among other things.Big data analytics places rigorous needs on networks, storage, and servers. This is why few businesses use the cloud for this. Big data and cloud are combining to create new business prospects that support big data research while also overcoming numerous architectural challenges.For these mutually exclusive principles to coexist a solution architecture is required to truly exploit. Future breakthroughs and research difficulties in cloud computing that support Big Data analytics are presented in this review.', 'In recent days most of the researcher and experts are defining the big data as per their understanding as a result there is no particular definition available for the Big data in general. Today hot area of research is big data analytics and due to that so many researchers have published their study in the area of Big Data. Major criteria in in solving the query in Big data is speed to make it optimal choice the engineers can make use of indexing. Parallelization is the best way to deal with the solutions in big data effectively and by using the good algorithmic solutions. Online Big Data Applications are utilized by the system of government to reduce the cost. All these techniques are making good profit to the organizations but at the same time it creates lot of security threats for the organizations. Industry is worried about the security issues with reference to big data. The main problem is related to the data mining and the information should not be exposed with the third party other than the users. New challenges are there for the researcher as the data is dynamic in nature and it drastically changed each and every point of time. Data is not easy to process with the traditional techniques for that latest technique and algorithms need to be utilized for the big data analytics.', 'Summary form only given. The convergence of multiple rEvolutions - Internet, Data, Software, Computing, Hardware, and Personalized attention is transforming governments across the world, on how they provide services to their citizens and remain relevant. The convergence of multiple forces enables the government to leverage Big Data, Smart Data and Dark Data by leveraging the concept of Big Open Data. The Big Open Data provides holistic views of citizens and other entities, real-time delivery of information to protect and service citizens and prevent fraud and abuse of countries resources.

Its potential lies in optimising existing business models and creating innovative ones based on various technologies, making them fit for the future by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fulfilling future decarbonization goals. In order to ensure a successful digital transformation towards decarbonization, managers have to assess the capabilities of their organisation and competently oversee their journey by defining a clear path employing digital maturity models. For this purpose, the analysis focused on published literature concerning digital maturity models developed to guide organisations in navigating their digital transformation journey. A systematic literature review of 36 selected digital maturity models is presented in this paper. These models overlook decarbonisation measures and focus solely on demonstrating digital capabilities, efficiency and profit growth. Therefore, a maturity model for digital decarbonization encompassing dimensions of decarbonization goals, business model innovation, customers and suppliers, products and services, employees, collaboration, processes and activities, data, and IT-infrastructure, -security and -technology has been developed. It assists organisations in reducing their carbon footprint by strategically and effectively leveraging digital technologies. The proposed model has five maturity levels: assess and align, engage and refine, innovate and collaborate, optimize and personalize, and transform and decarbonize. This paper aims to assess the current level of digital decarbonization and determine the position of the organizations. Additionally, it endeavours to identify the specific opportunities for growth that digitalization presents, thereby enabling the creation of a new digital carbon-free existence.', 'Purpose This study addresses the integration of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies with circular economy (CE) principles in the UAE construction sector, aligning with the UAE Circular Economy Policy 2021–2031 (UAECEP).
