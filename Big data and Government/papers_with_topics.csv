Pannel: Digital Transformation Impact on Society,2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.4930890224889271,"In this panel, we are going to discuss the impact of digital transformation will have on society. Digital technologies are rapidly and profoundly changing the world in promising and threatening ways. Technologies such as Big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, 3D promise to have a profoundly disruptive effect on the industry, business models, governance models and on the way we interact with each other in society. These unprecedented speed, scale and scope of change can provoke inequalities favoring world-s richest people become wealthier than ever and a social shock where people lose their old references and competences. Which influence the globalization, circular economy, sharing economy and climate change will have on this digital transformation - How they will shape it? (1) Left this transformation unmanaged, the technologies will shape us and in the age of artificial intelligence and biotechnologies, this can be very dangerous - How we can counteract it? (2) Norms and rules are needed on different domains and levels, strategies to respond to technologies dark side and risks, leaders must be more conscious of their acts and consequences on the environment and social stability - Can these measures help to achieve sustainable development? (3) The changes provoked by this digital transformation will affect governments, industry, and society as a whole - How governments shall design their e-Government and Smart Cities strategies to be better prepared? (4) How industry shall design its Industry 4.0 strategy to be better prepared? (5)",10.1109/ICEDEG.2019.8734405,N. Lopes; H. R. Rao; S. A. McKenna; S. Yang; E. Estevez; M. Nielsen

Research on Intelligent Supervision and Application System of Food Traceability Based on Blockchain and Artificial intelligence,2021,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"The lack of transparency in the production and circulation of commodities and the lack of corresponding supervision have led to endless problems such as food safety, counterfeit and shoddy products, loss and damage of commodities, and damage to the rights and interests of consumers. The traditional centralized database traceability monitoring system has serious problems of data trust, data fragmentation, difficulty in accountability, and low enthusiasm of merchants. In order to solve the traditional system problems, it is proposed to build an intelligent supervision system model for food traceability based on blockchain and artificial intelligence. Blockchain technology can effectively make up and improve the shortcomings of the existing commodity traceability technology, and achieve full process control and real-time storage. Forensic forensics, increase transparency, prevent counterfeiting, and increase consumer trust; AI uses industry-sharing data to perform big data analysis to guide companies in business decisions; at the same time, in order to increase user stickiness and increase the ecological environment of the platform, the article proposes to increase Blockchain and artificial intelligence and application ecology form a more practical and complete integrated system model of traceability, supervision and application. Finally, using FISCO BCOS as a blockchain platform development platform, the validity of the model is verified, and it can provide a certain reference for food traceability companies, software R&D companies, and government regulatory agencies.",10.1109/ICIBA52610.2021.9688295,C.

Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction Based on Ensemble Machine Learning Strategies,2021,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.5339622714854683,"In order to solve the problem of traffic congestion, many city governments have begun to develop intelligent transportation systems. As a research hotspot in the field of intelligent transportation, the short-term traffic flow prediction is of great significance to traffic diversion and route planning. In the recent big data era, the machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to mining deep information in the data. However, the performance of a single ML model is usually not good. The ensemble learning can improve accuracy in most cases. In this paper, we propose a new short-term traffic flow prediction model. This paper regards the traffic prediction problem as a regression prediction problem, rather than a time series forecasting problem. The proposed model combines the prediction results of the XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost models through the ensemble machine learning strategy. With the experiments on real traffic data in Xi'an city, this paper has obtained the comparison of predictive performance of the models. Compared with single models such as the ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost models, the results show the proposed model is more accurate and more suitable for short-time traffic status prediction.",10.1109/DDCLS52934.2021.9455594,X.

Research on Evaluation Index System of Urban Bus and Trolleybus Line Network,2021,-1,Outliers,0.5118529354939699,"Public transport is an important part of urban development and management. Urban bus and trolleybus are parts of urban public transport and one of the most basic modes of travel provided by the government for the public, which are related to the immediate interests of the public. Urban bus and trolleybus network is the layout of bus and trolleybus on the road network. The more reasonable the bus network layout is, the higher the service level of bus and trolleybus will be. However, there are few researches on the evaluation of bus and trolleybus line network in China at present, a systematic evaluation index system has not yet been established, which makes it difficult to systematically and effectively evaluate the line network. In this paper, the evaluation indexes suitable for each city are selected from the perspective of the performance of bus and trolleybus line network and the bus and trolleybus operation effect to establish an evaluation index system of bus and trolleybus line network, including 11 indexes.

Mobility of Indonesian during Early Pandemic: Insights from Mobile Positioning Data,2022,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.6428670220889419,"Mobile Positioning Data (MPD) contains information on the location of the mobile phone by approximating mobile phones’ location relative to fixed infrastructures (e.g., telecommunication towers that transmit signals). While the data query is technically straightforward, obtaining this dataset requires particular permission to protect customers’ privacy. Additionally, the dataset has large volumes of data (i.e, up to 300GB per day), resulting in not many researchers holding this data source to analyze the mobility of people. In this work, we collaborate with one of the biggest telecommunication service providers in Indonesia to collect MPD and prepare the big data infrastructure. We thus analyze mobility patterns during the early phase of COVID-19 in 2020 using actual Mobile Positioning Data in five provinces in Java. We use three metrics, namely, the number of visits, averaged travel distance, and Origin-Destination matrix. The findings indicate that the social restriction in the corresponding provinces has reduced the average traveled distance of the people, but not their number of visits. That is, while the traveled distance has declined more than eight times compared to the baseline, the number of visits may rocket up, up to nine times. It indicates that people are still having shorter trips even though their regular activities (working, schooling, etc.) have been restricted. The data also show that during Ramadhan month, the government has a successful intervention in restricting people for mudik Lebaran, The number of visits dropped to below 30 visits during Ramadhan and only small spikes exist during ‘libur lebaran’.",10.1109/ICITEE56407.2022.9954078,Widyawan; M.

Parallel Assisted Learning,2022,-1,Outliers,0.12388206197996461,"In the era of big data, a population's multimodal data are often collected and preserved by different business and government entities. These entities often have their local machine learning data, models, and tasks that they cannot share with others. Meanwhile, an entity often needs to seek assistance from others to enhance its learning quality without sharing proprietary information. How can an entity be assisted while it is assisting others? We develop a general method called parallel assisted learning (PAL) that applies to the context where entities perform supervised learning and can collate their data according to a common data identifier. Under the PAL mechanism, a learning entity that receives assistance is obligated to assist others without the need to reveal any entity's local data, model, and learning objective. Consequently, each entity can significantly improve its particular task. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated by data experiments.",10.1109/TSP.2022.3229637,X. Wang; J.

In this survey, we review the usage of NoSQL databases to the storage of large RDF graphs by rehearsing the latest surveys and expanding their findings by updating proposals and bringing light to aspects such as model mapping between RDF and NoSQL, triple indexing and partitioning, graph fragmentation and data caching. Moreover, we explain how the surveyed works extended the RDF capabilities so the datasets can benefit of the characteristics of scalability, schemaless data, and better overall performance of NoSQL databases. The survey summarizes the current state of art, discusses open problems, and proposes a Reference Architecture (RA). For the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey where the focus is solely on papers that use one or more NoSQL systems for the RDF persistence.",10.1109/TKDE.2020.2994521,L. H. Z.

Co-Production Active Learning for Operational Sea Ice Mapping,2022,-1,Outliers,0.11150250301310137,"Intensified climate warming is extending ice-free conditions, and, in turn, increasing high-latitude maritime activity. This environmental shift, in conjunction with emerging satellite technologies and resulting Big Data streams, enhances operational pressure on organizations such as the United States National Ice Center (USNIC), who provides the U.S Government with sea ice charts for maritime safety of navigation and maritime-domain awareness. To advance technical capabilities, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) collaborated with the USNIC on an R&D sea ice program, to develop Machine-Learning based algorithms, which include a tool that deploys Active Learning methods for sea ice classification using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Active Learning algorithms are particularly advantageous because they selectively query users for additional labeled data, leading to effective learning strategies that require substantially less training data compared to traditional methods. We present the Human-machine-teaming tool (NOEL), which has shown a user need only label 5 image patches to achieve a 94% classification accuracy of ice/open water at native image resolution. In addition, NOEL is computationally efficient, requiring minutes to run with current USNIC computing systems. Lastly, we present the Ice Analyzer, a web-based tool which facilitates analysis of the sea ice products created by NOEL. Such advancements in which the NGA and USNIC are developing address current and future demands of a rapidly changing Arctic.",,M. Ortiz; E. B. Wendoloski; P. C. Slingerland; T. Le; E. R.

Confli-T5: An AutoPrompt Pipeline for Conflict Related Text Augmentation,2022,3,Topic_3_social_media_social media,1.0,"Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and Big Data technologies have been crucial for scientists to analyze political unrest and violence, prevent harm, and promote global conflict management. Government agencies and public security organizations have invested heavily in deep learning-based applications to study global conflicts and political violence. However, such applications involving text classification, information extraction, and other NLP-related tasks require extensive human efforts in annotating/labeling texts. While limited labeled data may drastically hurt the models’ performance (over-fitting), large demands on annotation tasks may turn real-world applications impracticable. To address this problem, we propose Confli-T5, a prompt-based method that leverages the domain knowledge from existing political science ontology to generate synthetic but realistic labeled text samples in the conflict and mediation domain. Our model allows generating textual data from the ground up and employs our novel Double Random Sampling mechanism to improve the quality (coherency and consistency) of the generated samples. We conduct experiments over six standard datasets relevant to political science studies to show the superiority of Confli-T5.

Private Data Protection as Countermeasure Against Misuses of Medical Intelligent Technology Data: a Literature Study,2022,4,Topic_4_healthcare_health_data,0.4470807734800635,"Medical Technologies develop along with the development of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (I.R. 4.0). In I.R. 4.0, a collaborative ecosystem is formed between cyber technology and automation technology to be able to create ""intelligent"" systems to facilitate various human activities, including activities related to health. The most important thing in the system is data since it is the basis for the development of various key icons technologies in the I.R. 4.0: Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (Al), Augmented Reality, and Cyber Security. Unfortunately, with the variety of I.R. 4.0 products, the data produced by these products is also scattered everywhere. Misuse of this scattered data—which the owner may not even know where the data are stored—can harm the individual concerned, and even the very existence of the state. Healthcare services now are undergoing Digital Transformation in which these data were needed to build high-quality services. The Health Digital Transformation strategy changes the direction of health services to be simpler and easier to use by the public, increasing efficiency, and thus providing a higher quality health service system so that it can trigger better economic growth. On the regulatory aspect, The Private Data Protection Bill was proposed by the Indonesian government to protect the data of the Indonesian people. Literature studies are used to obtain knowledge between the three: technology development, digital transformation in healthcare, and private data protection.

Lightweight Verifiable Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation for Smart Grids,2024,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.6209522743020714,"As an indispensable part of a smart city, the smart grid has gained widespread attention from industrial and academic communities. How to securely collect users’ real-time energy consumption data to provide services such as big data analytics and demand-response services while ensuring the privacy of individual users is a challenging issue in the smart grid. The privacy-preserving data aggregation (P2DA) suggests a feasible solution. For years, researchers have designed numerous P2DA schemes for securing smart grids. Unfortunately, the majority of them have some security and privacy deficiencies. Other schemes are unsuitable for resource-constrained smart meters due to expensive cryptographic operations. In this work, we design a lightweight verifiable certificate-based P2DA scheme LV-P2DA without pairings for smart grids. We formally prove its security under standard cryptographic assumptions. The performance comparison results illustrate that compared with state-of-the-art solutions, our design achieves at least a 99.43% improvement in computational cost and a 32.96% improvement in communication cost on the smart meter side, respectively.",10.1109/JIOT.2024.3419161,F.

City Hotspot Identification Using Smart Cyber-Physical Social System,2024,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.6666933275913839,"Recently, the concept of smart cities has become popular and got researchers’ attention because it helps to improve citizens’ lives by providing valuable services, for instance, smart transportation, smart homes, telecommunication, infrastructure, etc. Hotspot analysis is a classic problem concerned with spatial analysis. Telecommunication operators and companies always care to identify the Hotspots in the city. The hotspots are the places with very high communication strength relative to others. It is evident from the current literature that cyber physics social systems (CPSS) are useful in the identification of hotspots in a smart city. However, big data storage, analysis, processing, accuracy, and robustness are the key concerns. Thus herein, we propose a smart cyber-physical-social system for the analysis of hotspots using telecom data. Herein, our proposed CPS model is comprised of three layers and each layer has different functionality. In our proposed model, initially, raw Call Detail Data (CDR) data is collected at the data collection layer. Then smart CPSS passed it to the next layer. In the Data processing layer, CPSS performs pre-processing, data storage, and analysis. Then, it constructs a graph and performs a social network analysis (SNA). Herein, different from traditional centrality measures, we suggest Eigenvector and k-shell as social network similarity and Jaccard, cosine, as social behavioral measures. Herein, the process of city hotspot identification is performed, followed by SNA, which is conducted by quantifying the importance of each hotspot based on metrics. Finally, our proposed smart CPSS model accurately identifies Top-Ten hotspots. In this study, we use five-day data and compare the changes in the hotspot patterns. We validate our findings of hotspots with the original dataset and confirm the robustness and accuracy using autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3391061,F. Amin; L.

EpiMob: Interactive Visual Analytics of Citywide Human Mobility Restrictions for Epidemic Control,2023,4,Topic_4_healthcare_health_data,1.0,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has swept across more than 180 countries and territories since late January 2020. As a worldwide emergency response, governments have implemented various measures and policies, such as self-quarantine, travel restrictions, work from home, and regional lockdown, to control the spread of the epidemic. These countermeasures seek to restrict human mobility because COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that is spread by human-to-human transmission. Medical experts and policymakers have expressed the urgency to effectively evaluate the outcome of human restriction policies with the aid of big data and information technology. Thus, based on big human mobility data and city POI data, an interactive visual analytics system called Epidemic Mobility (EpiMob) was designed in this study. The system interactively simulates the changes in human mobility and infection status in response to the implementation of a certain restriction policy or a combination of policies (e.g., regional lockdown, telecommuting, screening). Users can conveniently designate the spatial and temporal ranges for different mobility restriction policies. Then, the results reflecting the infection situation under different policies are dynamically displayed and can be flexibly compared and analyzed in depth. Multiple case studies consisting of interviews with domain experts were conducted in the largest metropolitan area of Japan (i.e., Greater Tokyo Area) to demonstrate that the system can provide insight into the effects of different human mobility restriction policies for epidemic control, through measurements and comparisons.",10.1109/TVCG.2022.3165385,C.

By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, requiring a 70 percent increase in global food production. Traditional agricultural practices are becoming increasingly inefficient and unreliable because of several issues, including soil degradation, water stress, nutrition shortage, insufficient infrastructure linkages, post-harvest loss, and information asymmetry. However, detrimental climate change is one of the most severe concerns confronting this industry. Thus, smart farming or digital agriculture is now regarded as a far more sustainable practice as it includes the management of farms via edge cutting technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones, big data etc. to maximize the quantity and quality of crops while minimizing the abundance of human work needed. It entails using sensors and automated irrigation procedures to monitor agricultural land, temperature, soil moisture, pH level, etc. Employing these technologies increases profitability, decreases waste, and preserves environmental quality. Although the smart agriculture business is expanding rapidly due to the world’s growing population and rising food consumption, this field still has a scope of academic literature. This paper aims to describe the different cutting-edge technologies currently being used in smart farming, their use cases, and their future directions.

Advanced Cold Plate Liquid Cooling Solution for Hyper-scale Data Center Application,2023,7,Topic_7_energy_power_data,0.3427256862422115,"With the rapid development of 5G, artificial intelligence(AI), big data and cloud computing, high performance and density data centers have become the fundamental infrastructure to address the continuous demand for cost-efficiency and energy-efficiency application. In order to cope with the performance and density request, the power consumption of CPU and GPU chips has significantly increased year by year, resulting in huge thermal design challenges with traditional air-cooling solution. For example, Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (codenamed Ice Lake) is up to 270W and TDP of Nvidia A100 GPU is up to 500W. This is almost beyond the cooling capability of traditional air-cooling solution under current thermal boundary condition due to limitation of heatsink size and air flow. In addition, Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is playing an increasingly key role on newly built data centers and has become mandatory requirement in government regulations. Under these circumstances, advanced cooling solution is urgently requested. Liquid cooling solution is an efficient solution to tackle the increasing power density in the data centers and becomes increasingly popular in modern data centers due to its excellent cooling capability, energy efficiency and PUE. This paper introduces the engineering practice of cold plate liquid cooling solution for hyper-scale data center application adopted by Volcano Engine, the cloud service platform under ByteDance.COM, covering the architecture and design from facility, server to components. This paper also includes the design and optimization of cold plate as well as other ingredients as coolant distribution unit(CDU), manifold, cold plate, tube, liquid leakage detection methodology. The thermal performance and power consumption are also analyzed and compared with air cooled system. The quality and reliability results are summarized based on more than six months of functional testing with over one thousand of pilot deployment servers powered with Ice Lake processors under cold plate liquid cooling solution in data center.",10.1109/ITherm55368.2023.10177549,C.

Investigation on Immersion Cooling Solution for Hyper-scale Data Center Application,2023,7,Topic_7_energy_power_data,0.3320845444217487,"Novel technologies such as cloud computing, Big Data, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been widely applied worldwide to cater for various industrial application, eventually demanding more and more powerful data centers. Data center's thermal cooling strategy has been evolving in the past years and most traditional data centers still adopts air cooling solution for IT equipment's' cooling and dissipates the waste heat to environment directly. However, air cooling solution has almost reached the bottleneck to cool high power of CPU and GPU and also consumes substantial portion of total data center's power budget, which hurt both energy efficiency and operational expense (OpEx). As governments around the world have begun to request optimal Power Usage Effectiveness(PUE) for newly built large scale data centers, advanced liquid cooling solution is urgently being requested. One of the approaches is the immersion cooling solution with IT systems immersed in thermally conductive dielectric liquid, which has recently gained increasing attention from the industry to address the challenges in terms of thermal design and PUE requirement. However, due to lack of published validation result and long-term reliability statistics of immersion cooling solution, most data centers still hesitate to adopt this novel cooling technology. This paper introduces the best practice of single-phase immersion cooling solution applied by Volcano Engine, the cloud service platform under ByteDance.COM, including the architecture of immersion cooled data center, liquid tank, liquid candidates and server systems as well as thermal cooling performance, signal integrity impact, and results comparison with air cooled servers.

Most companies are implementing DT strategies, and the Global Pandemic may have accelerated the digitization of businesses. Concurrently, another set of trends focus on the need for improving the sustainability of business processes. It is now widely accepted the Earth cannot tolerate a continue, average increase in global temperatures at the rate it is currently experiencing. Governments committed to carbon emission goals have tighten environment regulations. Moreover, customers and even investors have shifted their mindset and sustainability related performance indicators are now part of the decision of doing business with a company or not. Lastly, an increasing number of business leaders are implementing principled leadership approaches, including social and environmental issues in their agenda. To make the matters worse, new technology developments like AI have the reputation of being power hungry requiring increasingly larges amount of energy to run. It is arguable DT may be further worsening the environmental crisis. As a sign of hope, there are multiple industry cases of the application of digital technologies, notably AI supported by BD, as enablers of sustainable business practices have emerged in recent years. The main objective of this research is to conduct an analysis of select industry examples investigate the potential of DT as an enabler of sustainable business processes instead of an additional cause of concern.

Research on Cross-Chain Consensus Models in Complex Trust Environments,2023,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.6774919698350237,"With the application of blockchain technology in the fields of energy big data, government affairs and data sharing, the types of blockchain adapted to various scenarios have gradually flourished, and the ledgers operate in isolation from each other, forming data silos and causing challenges for interchain data access and consistent collaboration. Most of the current cross-chain mechanisms based on blockchain are notary mode and relay mode, which cannot be dynamically switched according to their respective organizations' trust degree, making it difficult to meet the requirements of cross-chain data access between blockchain systems in complex trust environments. Based on this issue, a cross-chain consensus model based on trust establishment is proposed. The scheme constructs a blockchain security trust model based on the network state, blockchain system security, node data consistency and malicious node rate during blockchain operations, combines fuzzy theory and probability distributions to determine the trust components of each system, and uses those trust components and their weights to determine the system's trust value. The cross-chain consensus scheme is designed based on this model, which can be flexibly switched between the notary model and the committee relay model to satisfy cross-chain interconnection and mutual access between systems with different trust relationships. The simulation results show that the proposed model and scheme have good performance in terms of stability and performance.",10.1109/NaNA60121.2023.00065,C. Liu; L. Tang; L. Che; Y. Zhang; H.

ISD2K reference model to represent an information system oriented to knowledge production,2023,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.4572376995467456,"The generation of knowledge (K) is a continuous and necessary effort for human evolution. Electronic records have enabled data processing, storage, and transfer to extend and accelerate this evolutionary effort. Electronic systems have been created to automate and record data from a process, for governments, organizations, and even for individuals. The expansion of these systems and the gradual increase of their complexity demanded the creation of Information Systems (IS) that aggregate data from several other systems to perform analysis and reports to support decision making, i.e., knowledge production (KP). The concept of Big Data - large volumes of data, with diverse structures, produced at an uncommon speed - describes the exponential growth of data production, but the same did not happen with the production of K. The objective of this work was to contribute to reduce this gap through the presentation of a reference model of IS to represent comprehensive and qualitatively measurable architectures in the KP. The method proposed in this work was the literature review about K, IS and reference models for information systems architecture (ISA), followed by the proposition of an IS reference model oriented to the conversion of data into knowledge (ISD2K) through a static and dynamic conceptual model. This proposition was validated from the description of a use case using ISD2K and elaboration of adherence questionnaires and evaluation of two IS in use at INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais).

Intelligent smart city platform,2017,-1,Outliers,0.2851165829542526,"Smart City platform have been developed in the city and national level. From Smart City, IoT is an important means to resolve current issues. Technical elements of the IoT is sensing, wired and wireless communications, network, service interfaces, big data, security etc. Usually, Machine-to-Machine communications (M2M) is a phenomenon that has been proceeding quietly in the background. Current international standard was presented as a reference model in One M2M which is leading IoT. The four areas are IoT service-centric platform, data-centric platform, connectivity-centric platform, and device platform. To avoid creation of competing M2M standards the 7 standards developing organizations, that publish telecom standards: TTC, ARIB (Japan), ATIS, TIA (USA), TTA (Korea) CCSA (China), ETSI (Europe) started the OneM2M Global Initiative to develop one globally agreed M2M Specification with initial focus on Service Layer. OneM2M aims to consolidate current M2M Service Layer standards activities such as ETSI TC M2M (Europe), TIA TR-50 (USA) and CCSA TC 10 (China), and to reduce standardization overlap and confusion and provide ongoing standards support to enhance interoperability, reduce market fragmentation, and improve security and reliability. (Ref: http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/technology.om2m/). However, there is no international standardized IoT platform including data, service, connectivity and device, what is more there is no clear national standardized platform satisfy the reference model that is presented by oneM2M institute which is a leading organization to establish an international IoT standardized platform.

A Novel Approach for Parallelized Clustering Model by Using Hadoop Map-Reduce Framework,2022,-1,Outliers,0.11087168165284272,"The current generation of cellular devices have plenty of processing power and storage, but they lag behind in terms of huge data storage and processing software. ""Big Data"" is referred to huge volumes of unstructured data generated by high-performance applications from scientific computers to social networks, e-government to medical information systems, and so on. According to recent big data study, the amount of data continues to grow at an exponential rate. A strong computing paradigm like Hadoop and Map-Reduce is required to process enormous amounts of data on computing clusters. The Map-Reduce framework is a programming technique that allows you to handle terabytes of data in a fraction of the time. Big data needs good scheduling in order to attain outstanding results. The Scheduling Technique is used to decrease hunger, enhance resource utilisation, and distribute work to available resources.For the Hadoop Map-Reduce model, various scheduling algorithm has been developed, which differs widely in design, behavior, and handling various issues. Existing resource allocation scheduling do not consider the weight of each job which leads to unbalanced performance among nodes. We focus on several issues of Hadoop Map reduce and introduce novel mechanism to handle and process the Big data. The proposed approach is divided into three phases such as implementation of optimized clustering scheme, improving the clustering scheme by implementation them in parallel manner and finally, incorporating machine learning and Fuzzy logic based intelligent techniques to adapt the big data changes to efficiently process the huge data.In first phase, we develop improved P-DBSCAN algorithm which uses Mapper and reducer programs in such a way so that input data points will get into the cluster formulation. The proposed approach consists of several stages such as data partitioning stage, local clustering stage, data merger stage and global cluster generation stage as final outcome. Moreover, two cluster optimization methods are included to improve the clustering performance. DBSCAN parallelization options are examined using the Spark platform built to maximize memory consumption and iterative processes. Single-node Spark and Spark cluster platforms have historically used distinct resource managers for DBSCAN optimization.In second stage, we adopt the concept of Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm and developed a novel clustering scheme to overcome the issues of DBSCAN. This scheme uses mapper and reducer entities. Mapper receives its copy of the input dataset. Labeling activities are carried out by the Mapper, such as finding the closest centroid to an individual data object. The reducer creates a new value for each centroid based on the items allocated to it in the current iteration of the algorithm. This is determined by evaluating the average of all of the data objects in each cluster. Later, K-Medoid method proposed utilizing medoids as the center of clusters since they can be influenced by outliers, although this is a disadvantage. It aims to reduce the cost between the cluster's non-medoids and its medoid.Finally, we focus on semantic relationship extraction between queries where we adopted neuro-fuzzy based hybrid technique and TF-IDF algorithm. In this thesis, we developed a hybrid approach by using Fuzzy logic and neural network to mine high fuzzy utility patterns. New fuzzy rules are defined based on 6 different criteria such as Query Time, Query Length, Query Expiry, Total Queries, CPU Usages, and Task activity. First of all, we perform the data pre-processing where several tasks are performed to filter the data, later, these queries are processed through the scheduler where fuzzy rule based is used and semantic relationship is established among queries. Based on the TF-IDF approach weight are computed from filtered data. The average runtime performance of these schemes is obtained as 167.5s, 137.5s, 51.25s, 37.5s, and 25s by using Apriori (M), HFUPM, Apriori, and EFUPM, Proposed Approach, respectively.",10.1109/ICWITE57052.2022.10176209,M.

Keynote Speech 5: Building an Ecosystem for Innovation that Matters,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.5556934509847138,"It is through innovation that nations evolve and economies grow. Naturally, every nation has its own demographic profile, social structures, natural resources, economic sectors dynamics, laws, traditions, etc. Innovation should take into consideration the specific characteristics of a society in order to effectively help its industry build useful products and its businesses (and government) provide life-enhancing services. It is therefore imperative for a nation to ensure that its domestic Research & Development organizations put appropriate focus on the development of the novel technologies and new business models that would most efficiently enable it to achieve its ambitious national objectives. In Egypt, several attempts to apply this simple principle have been made through the years. Not all institutions have succeeded in delivering the results that they were originally established to achieve. This presentation analyzes this dilemma, especially the notoriously difficult problem of ensuring the efficient collaboration among academia, industry, and government. A recent initiative geared towards tackling this challenge is examined in this presentation. The mission of the Applied Innovation Center at the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology is to explore and promote the use of emerging Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in analyzing and solving national challenges, while developing human capital and creating an environment for innovative enterprises to form and succeed.

Keynote speakers: Cyber-human partnerships — Towards a resilient ecosystem in smart cities,2017,-1,Outliers,0.28363954890809884,"In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such validations span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of Dny for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems. This lecture introduces the FC fundamental concepts and presents several applications in distinct areas of science and engineering.",10.1109/TSP.2017.8075923,

Keynote presentation 2: The Sputnik of servgoods: Autonomous vehicles,2016,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.5871017715160414,"Summary form only given. In an earlier paper [Tien 2015], the author defined the concept of a servgood, which can be thought of as a physical good or product enveloped by a services-oriented layer that makes the good smarter or more adaptable and customizable for a particular use. Adding another layer of physical sensors could then enhance its smartness and intelligence, especially if it were to be connected with each other or with other servgoods through the Internet of Things. Such sensed servgoods are becoming the products of the future. Indeed, autonomous vehicles can be considered the exemplar servgoods of the future; it is about decision informatics and embraces the advanced technologies of sensing (i.e., Big Data), processing (i.e., real-time analytics), reacting (i.e., real-time decision-making), and learning (i.e., deep learning). Since autonomous vehicles constitute a huge quality-of-life disruption, it is also critical to consider its policy impact on privacy and security, regulations and standards, and liability and insurance. Finally, just as the Soviet Union inaugurated the space age on October 4, 1957, with the launch of Sputnik, the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the U. S. has inaugurated an age of automata or autonomous vehicles that can be considered to be the U. S. Sputnik of servgoods, with the full support of the U. S. government, the U. S. auto industry, the U. S. electronic industry, and the U.S. higher educational enterprise.",10.1109/ICSSSM.2016.7538417,J. M. Tien
"Preface on special session “data impact: Big, open, linked data innovations”",2016,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.1723142594072487,"It is well known that in the contemporary times of knowledge, data plays a pivotal role in all facets of human activity and societal interest. Processing large amounts of data is increasingly considered as conditio sine qua non for policy making by governments and decision making by individuals or enterprises. Open data is published on the Web in many heterogeneous formats. New paradigms on data representation and applications development should not multiply the competing approaches for big data, but rather build on previous work and align the divergent approaches together through use of links and semantic relations. The benefits of the proposed approach based on linked data become apparent in tasks requiring combination of datasets from multiple sources. The absence of links and explicit semantics forms a barrier to automated processing, combining, and joining datasets of distinct origin. In context of such tasks, applying linked data and semantic web technologies offers greater data",10.1109/SMAP.2016.7753368,C. Bratsas; M. Nikolaidou; P. Bamidis

Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Medical Data Sharing in Internet of Things With Limited Computing Power,2018,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"With the application of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in smart city, intelligent medical terminals play a more and more significant role in our daily life. These terminals can monitor our physical conditions and get lots of medical data in time. For the sake of data security and practicality, the collected big data can be encrypted and then stored on a cloud server such that only authorized users, such as the data owner and the doctors, can access. However, smart terminals are usually limited in computing power and users' privacy issues remain. To tackle this challenging problem, an efficient medical data sharing scheme is presented in this paper. To solve the privacy issues in users' data sharing, we utilize attribute-based encryption to enable data sharing. In addition, we remove the attribute matching function and use the attribute bloom filter to hide all the attributes in the access control structure. In order to improve the efficiency of encryption, we introduce the online/offline encryption technology in the encryption phase. Before the message is known, a large amount of work that is needed at the encryption stage will be done. Then, once the message is known, the ciphertext can be generated quickly. Besides, the initialization stage of the system does not need to specify all attributes. When the overall attributes of the system users increase, the system does not need to be reinitialized, which will also improve the system efficiency. Security analysis and performance analysis show that the data sharing scheme is secure and can improve data processing ability in IoT based data sharing.",10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2840504,D. Zheng; A.

A Neighbor-Based Probabilistic Broadcast Protocol for Data Dissemination in Mobile IoT Networks,2018,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.6885706444604559,"The recent trend of implementing Internet of Things (IoT) applications is to transmit sensing data to a powerful data center and try to discover the valuable knowledge behind “Big Data”by various intelligent but resource-consuming algorithms. However, from the discussion with some industrial companies, it is understood that disseminating real-time sensing data to their nearby network-edge applications directly would produce a more economical design and lower service latency for some important smart city applications. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient broadcast protocol to disseminate data in mobile IoT networks. The proposed protocol exploits the neighbor knowledge of mobile nodes to determine a rebroadcast delay that prioritizes different packet broadcasts according to their profits. An adaptive connectivity factor is also introduced to make the proposed protocol adaptive to the node density of different network parts. By combining the neighbor knowledge of nodes and adaptive connectivity factor, a reasonable probability is calculated to determine whether a packet should be rebroadcasted to other nodes or be discarded to prevent redundant packet broadcast. Extensive simulation results have validated that this protocol can improve the success ratio of packet delivery by 13% ~ 28% with a similar end-to-end transmission delay and network overhead of the most state-of-art approaches.",10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2808356,W.

Machine Learning Based Context-Predictive Car-to-Cloud Communication Using Multi-Layer Connectivity Maps for Upcoming 5G Networks,2018,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.5089488947826574,"While cars were only considered as means of personal transportation for a long time, they are currently transcending to mobile sensor nodes that gather highly up-to-date information for crowdsensing-enabled big data services in a smart city context. Consequently, upcoming 5G communication networks will be confronted with massive increases in Machine-type Communication (MTC) and require resource-efficient transmission methods in order to optimize the overall system performance and provide interference-free coexistence with human data traffic that is using the same public cellular network. In this paper, we bring together mobility prediction and machine learning based channel quality estimation in order to improve the resource-efficiency of car-to-cloud data transfer by scheduling the transmission time of the sensor data with respect to the anticipated behavior of the communication context. In a comprehensive field evaluation campaign, we evaluate the proposed context-predictive approach in a public cellular network scenario where it is able to increase the average data rate by up to 194% while simultaneously reducing the mean uplink power consumption by up to 54%.",10.1109/VTCFall.2018.8690856,B.

An application to manage widespread social media accounts with one smart touch,2018,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7787863307579054,"Currently, real-time big data is an integral aspect of accelerating smart city development and improving operations. However, collecting, storing and analyzing this information is not a simple matter, and in many studies determining where the real-time data can be captured is a major problem. Although every social network has unique features and purposes, what they have in common is the sharing and connecting of real-time data. Vast volumes of information are associated with social media, including images, videos, text, identities, and events. In addition, a wide range of social networking used by a great number of people worldwide is not merely for entertainment or pleasure; indeed, some of the most important applications of social media are business-related projects, marketing, and internation.

Revealing Generalized Load Characteristics with Variable Scale User Portrait,2018,7,Topic_7_energy_power_data,1.0,"With the development of distributed energy technologies, the proportion of generalized load in electric load has greatly increased. Traditional research methods lack variation among different scales and efficiency in big data processing. This paper proposes variable scale user portrait to visually reveal temporal distribution characteristics of generalized load. We adopt it to the data of 3500 customers of Australian Smart Grid, Smart City(SGSC) program. We first set up the label system which is key to user portrait. With Euclidean distance based distributed clustering(EDBDC), the typical users are obtained quickly and efficiently. Then we construct the user portrait with variable time scale load curves for each customer category. The result pattern can provide exploitable information to utilities and retailers for efficient design and implementation of energy service targeted to various customer categories.",10.1109/POWERCON.2018.8602104,C.

Enhancing Community Detection for Big Sensor Data Clustering via Hyperbolic Network Embedding,2018,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.564163342404343,"In this paper we present a novel big data clustering approach for measurements obtained from pervasive sensor networks. To address the potential very large scale of such datasets, we map the problem of data clustering to a community detection one. Datasets are cast in the form of graphs, representing the relations among individual observations and data clustering is mapped to node clustering (community detection) in the data graph. We propose a novel computational approach for enhancing the traditional Girvan-Newman (GN) community detection algorithm via hyperbolic network embedding. The data dependency graph is embedded in the hyperbolic space via Rigel embedding, making it possible to compute more efficiently the hyperbolic edge-betweenness centrality (HEBC) needed in the modified GN algorithm. This allows for more efficient clustering of the nodes of the data graph without significantly sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with artificial network and data topologies, and real benchmark datasets. The proposed methodology can be used for efficient clustering of datasets obtained from massive pervasive smart city/building sensor networks, such as the FIESTA-IoT platform, and exploited in various applications such as lower-cost sensing.",10.1109/PERCOMW.2018.8480134,V.

Deep Learning for Edge Computing Applications: A State-of-the-Art Survey,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.30240306294321206,"With the booming development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and communication technologies such as 5G, our future world is envisioned as an interconnected entity where billions of devices will provide uninterrupted service to our daily lives and the industry. Meanwhile, these devices will generate massive amounts of valuable data at the network edge, calling for not only instant data processing but also intelligent data analysis in order to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. Both the traditional cloud computing and on-device computing cannot sufficiently address this problem due to the high latency and the limited computation capacity, respectively. Fortunately, the emerging edge computing sheds a light on the issue by pushing the data processing from the remote network core to the local network edge, remarkably reducing the latency and improving the efficiency. Besides, the recent breakthroughs in deep learning have greatly facilitated the data processing capacity, enabling a thrilling development of novel applications, such as video surveillance and autonomous driving. The convergence of edge computing and deep learning is believed to bring new possibilities to both interdisciplinary researches and industrial applications. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest efforts on the deep-learning-enabled edge computing applications and particularly offer insights on how to leverage the deep learning advances to facilitate edge applications from four domains, i.e., smart multimedia, smart transportation, smart city, and smart industry. We also highlight the key research challenges and promising research directions therein.

A Data Security Enhanced Access Control Mechanism in Mobile Edge Computing,2020,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Mobile edge computing, with characteristics of position awareness, mobile support, low latency, decentralization, and distribution, has received widespread attention from industry and academia, and has been applied to application areas such as intelligent transportation, smart city, and real-time big data analysis. However, it also brings the new security threats, especially data security threats during data access that leads to unauthorized/unauthorized access, alteration and disclosure of data, affecting the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Therefore, access control, as an important method to ensure the security of user data during data access, began to be applied to mobile edge computing. However, the existing access control has the disadvantages of coarse-grain, poor flexibility and accuracy, lack of internal attack considerations, etc., which cannot meet the needs of data security in practical applications of mobile edge computing. In this paper, a data security enhanced Fine-Grained Access Control mechanism (FGAC) is proposed to ensure data security during data access in mobile edge computing. In FGAC, a dynamic fine-grained trusted user grouping scheme based on attributes and metagraphs theory was first designed. Secondly, the scheme was combined with the traditional role-based access control mechanism to assign roles to users based on user group credibility. And then, based on attribute matching the user authentication further verifies whether the user is allowed to perform the access operations to achieve fine-grained data protection. Experimental results show that FGAC can effectively identify malicious users and make group adjustments, while achieving fine-grained access control and assure the data security during the data access process in mobile edge computing.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011477,Y.

Exploiting Location-Based Context for POI Recommendation When Traveling to a New Region,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.823768497531608,"Traveling to a new region has become a very common thing for people, due to work or life requirement. With the development of recommendation engine and the popularity of social media network, people are more and more used to relying on personalized Points-of-Interest (POI) recommendations. However, traditional approaches can fail if users moves to a region where they had little or no active history or even social network friends information before. Under the requirement of smart city construction, the need to give high quality personalized POI recommendation when a user travels to a new region has arisen. Fortunately, with the widespread of wireless Internet, the booming of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and the common-usage of location sensors in mobile phones, the coupling degree between social media networks and location information is ever increasing, which could leads us to a new way to solve this problem in the ear of Big Data. In this research, we presented New Place Recommendation Algorithm (N-PRA) which is designed based on Latent Factor model. Many different types of social media contexts (time-related and location-related), such as a user’s interest fluctuation, different types of POIs’ popularity fluctuation, types of POIs, the influence of geographical neighborhood on POIs, and user’s social network friendship are taken into consideration in this approach. The algorithm presented is verified on Yelp, an open-source real urban data-set, and compared against several other baseline POI recommendation algorithms. Experimental results show that the algorithm presented in this paper could achieve a better accuracy.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980982,K. Gao; X. Yang; C. Wu; T. Qiao; X. Chen; M. Yang; L. Chen
Analysis of Bus Trip Characteristic Analysis and Demand Forecasting Based on GA-NARX Neural Network Model,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Passenger flow is the basis for bus operation scheduling. Huge advances are being made to develop smart city traffic using big data. Intelligent bus systems based on bus integrated circuit (IC) card systems are constantly developing and improving. Compared with traditional manual survey data, bus IC data is low-cost, real-time and accurate with a simple acquisition method. Bus IC data is an important basic data resource and data mining of bus IC cards can obtain dynamic information about urban bus passenger flow and help improve urban bus planning and service levels. The crucial factor in determining whether this data can be reasonably applied to the optimization of urban bus systems is whether spatial and temporal characteristics of the passenger bus trip can be obtained through bus IC data mining, and there is much current research interest into this topic. In this paper, the characteristics of one-day passenger flow and time-division passenger flow are analyzed based on data obtained from swiping IC cards for one week on a bus in Qingdao. Then, based on a GA-NARX neural network model, the passenger flow is forecast using the IC card swipe data for five working days of Qingdao No. 1 bus (using ten minutes as the time interval). The forecasting results show that the passenger flow can be successfully predicted using this method and thus this method can be used for short-term passenger flow forecasting using bus IC cards.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964689,F.

Parallel t-SNE Applied to Data Visualization in Smart Cities,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.4462647332736186,"The growth of smart city applications is increasingly around the world, many cities invest in the development of these systems intending to improve the management and life of their residents. This increase is mainly due to the emergence of new technologies such as Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT). Some of the biggest challenges in applying these systems, relate to the processing, visualization, and analysis of the generated data, since most systems tend to work connected, thus generating a large mass of data that deviates from the standard of previously used systems. For data visualization, one of the main devices used is the reduction of dimensionality, in an attempt to bring data from one dimension N to two or three dimensions and thus be noticeable to human eyes. There are several algorithms used for dimensionality reduction, the linear ones that as the name implies, solve linearly separable problems and so these are very limited and the nonlinear ones, that solve more complex problems, but usually have an excessive runtime, making them or often inappropriate to apply. This article presents the parallel implementation of the nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), showing better results than its conventional version in terms of runtime, thus showing that parallelism can make the problem of dimensionality reduction treatable, bringing greater scalability and delivering results within an acceptable time frame.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964413,M.

With the large scale implementation of EVs, a challenge that has to be addressed is the problem of “range anxiety”. With the installation of the charging infrastructures in large scale, it is essential to establish a reasonable operation mode in order to create the win-win situation for the charging infrastructure owners and the EV drivers. Meanwhile, the reliability and safety of the distribution grid should also be considered.

Trading Private Range Counting over Big IoT Data,2019,-1,Outliers,0.17437150941187013,"Data privacy arises as one of the most important concerns, facing the pervasive commoditization of big data statistic analysis in Internet of Things (IoT). Current solutions are incapable to thoroughly solve the privacy issues on data pricing and guarantee the utility of statistic outputs. Therefore, this paper studies the problem of trading private statistic results for IoT data, by considering three factors. Specifically, a novel framework for trading range counting results is proposed. The framework applies a sampling-based method to generate approximated counting results, which are further perturbed for privacy concerns and then released. The results are theoretically proved to achieve unbiasedness, bounded variance, and strengthened privacy guarantee under differential privacy. Moreover, a pricing approach is proposed for the traded results, which is proved to be immune against arbitrage attacks. The framework is evaluated by estimating the air pollution levels with different ranges on 2014 CityPulse Smart City datasets. The analysis and evaluation results demonstrate that our framework greatly reduces the error of range counting approximation; and the optimal perturbation approach enables that the private counting satisfies the specified approximation degree while providing strong privacy guarantee.",10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00023,Z.

TransLand: An Adversarial Transfer Learning Approach for Migratable Urban Land Usage Classification using Remote Sensing,2019,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.3224398481298016,"Urban land usage classification is a critical task in big data based smart city applications that aim to understand the social-economic land functions and physical land attributes in urban environments. This paper focuses on a migratable urban land usage classification problem using remote sensing data (i.e., satellite images). Our goal is to accurately classify the land usage of locations in a target city where the ground truth land usage data is not available by leveraging a classification model from a source city where such data is available. This problem is motivated by the limitation of current solutions that primarily rely on a rich set of ground-truth data for accurate model training, which encounters high annotation costs. Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: i) the target and source cities often have different urban characteristics that prevent the direct application of a model learned from the source city to the target city; ii) the complex visual features in satellite images make it non-trivial to “translate” the images from the target city to the source city for an accurate classification. To address the above challenges, we develop TransLand, an adversarial transfer learning framework to translate the satellite images from the target city to the source city for accurate land usage classification. We evaluate our scheme on the real-world satellite imagery and land usage datasets collected from live different cities in Europe. The results show that TransLand significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art land usage classification baselines in classifying the land usage of locations in a city.",10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006360,Y.

Parameter Communication Consistency Model for Large-Scale Security Monitoring Based on Mobile Computing,2019,-1,Outliers,0.13955060542164346,"With the application of mobile computing in the security field, security monitoring big data has also begun to emerge, providing favorable support for smart city construction and city-scale and investment expansion. Mobile computing takes full advantage of the computing power and communication capabilities of various sensing devices and uses these devices to form a computing cluster. When using such clusters for training of distributed machine learning models, the load imbalance and network transmission delay result in low efficiency of model training. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed machine learning parameter communication consistency model based on the parameter server idea, which is called the limited synchronous parallel model. The model is based on the fault-tolerant characteristics of the machine learning algorithm, and it dynamically limits the size of the synchronization barrier of the parameter server, reduces the synchronization communication overhead, and ensures the accuracy of the model training; thus, the model realizes finite asynchronous calculation between the worker nodes and gives full play to the overall performance of the cluster. The implementation of cluster dynamic load balancing experiments shows that the model can fully utilize the cluster performance during the training of distributed machine learning models to ensure the accuracy of the model and improve the training speed.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956632,R.

Deep Q-Network-Based Feature Selection for Multisourced Data Cleaning,2021,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.29945190968366336,"The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates information collected from multisources and is able to support various intelligent smart city applications, such as industrial manufacturing, power systems, and mobile healthcare. In the big data era, multisourced data are collected on a daily basis, whereas a large part of the data may be irrelevant, redundant, noisy, or even malicious from a machine learning perspective. Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep  $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based feature selection algorithms achieve much better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, and are robust under data poisoning attacks.",10.1109/JIOT.2020.3016297,Q.

M2ASR: Ambitions and first year progress,2017,3,Topic_3_social_media_social media,1.0,"In spite of the rapid development of speech techniques, most of the present achievements are for a few major languages, e.g., English and Chinese. Unfortunately, most of the languages in the world are 'minority languages', in the sense that they are spoken by a small population and with limited resource accumulation. Since the present speech technologies are mostly based on big data, partly due to the profound impact of deep learning, they are not directly applicable to minority languages. However, minority languages are so numerous and important that if we want to break the language barrier, they must be seriously taken into account. Recently, the Chinese government approved a fundamental research for minority languages in China: Multilingual Minorlingual Automatic Speech Recognition (M2ASR). Although the initial goal was speech recognition, the ambition of this project is more than that: it intends to publish all the achievements and make them free for the research community, including speech and text corpora, phone sets, lexicons, tools, recipes and prototype systems. In this paper, we will describe this project, report the first-year progress, and present the future plan.",10.1109/ICSDA.2017.8384469,D. Wang; T. F. Zheng; Z. Tang; Y. Shi; L. Li; S. Zhang; H.

Predicting daily consumer price index using support vector regression method based cloud computing,2017,-1,Outliers,0.1291405343048223,"Severe inflation can cause a country's economic downturn. Therefore, inflation needs to be controlled. One of inflation control conducted by the government is predicting and calculating inflation using CPI indicators on a monthly. Prediction with monthly frequency, could be too late, because inflation has been a few days and it is not known quickly. With the development of internet technology today, various data sources related to inflation easily obtained in real-time. This data can be used for daily CPI prediction. Daily predictions allow policy makers to make better policies. CPI prediction using daily data will face challenges. The growing variants and data volumes need good computing systems. Cloud computing can be used to solve the problem. This is a preliminary research in developing daily CPI prediction model using big data and cloud computing. Here we focus on developing a daily CPI prediction model using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method in a cloud computing. For better accuracy, we compared the kernel functions of SVR and tuning SVR parameters using the grid search and Random Search method. In addition, we compared SVR with the Random Forest method. These daily CPI predictions are simulated into cloud computing environments. From this simulation we show computation time and accuration comparisons needed if run on personal computers with cloud computing. The results showed that SVR using RBF kernel has less mse value 0.3454 in monthly prediction and 0.0095 in daily predictions. And Random Forest result is slightly different than SVR - RBF, mse value 0.0171 in daily prediction.

Common electronics are used in the design of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), targeting military, and civilian populations, while concealed recording devices steal proprietary/confidential data, compromising both government and industrial resources. This paper discusses a novel, nonintrusive, repeatable, reliable, expandable, and simple-to-implement detection and identification (D&I) system for identifying threats by using unintended radiated emissions (URE). This paper differs from current URE proposals, by avoiding energy radiation. The proposed process also addresses big data problems involved in capturing and building databases of URE characteristics. Issue interpretation is utilized with URE data to distinguish between threat/nonthreat devices using multiple criteria decision analysis and other decision-making techniques to determine model and mode of hidden devices. System optimization, verified by testing, is used to improve the speed and accuracy of the identification algorithm. The system is developed with data from 130 devices and validated with 33 separate devices, which are representative of IED and espionage threats. Due to slow progress in the URE D&I field, the properties and potential of a more effective D&I system, compared to current methods, will be of interest to the explosive ordnance disposal, security services, electronic systems manufacturing, automated inventory, mobile application development communities, and potentially others as well.

The Research on Agricultural Product Price Forecasting Service Based on Combination Model,2020,0,Topic_0_agriculture_agricultural_food,1.0,"Under the market economy, the moderate fluctuations in the price were normal reaction of the market mechanism. However, excessive fluctuations in the price would also bring adverse effects to corresponding industry. The price change of agricultural products was the great event vital to national well-being and the people's livelihood. Since the price of agricultural products was affected by many factors, it was difficult to predict the price of agricultural products timely and accurately. The emergence of cloud computing, accompanied by massive storage space, huge computing capacity and low cost, provided a new direction for data mining to deal with big data. To realize the short-term agricultural product price forecasting, took service oriented forecasting as the guidance, this paper constructed a agricultural product price forecasting service system based on the DOA architecture. The system could conduct the analysis and prediction for the market price through the combined forecasting method of wavelet transform and BP neural network. Based on the 72 sets of monthly price data from January 2013 to December 2018 of the spinach, cabbage, tomato, pepper and potato, this paper studied the changing trend of agricultural products price. Firstly, in this paper, the price was conducted the db5 three scale decomposition using wavelet transform. Then, the shredded trend part and detail part were predicted by BP neural network model respectively. Finally, the prediction results of each component were combined and reconstructed. On the basis of this combined forecasting method, the agricultural product price forecasting service system with functions of price data service and price forecasting service was designed based on DOA architecture. To verify the prediction accuracy to the price of the 5 kinds of vegetables, the prediction accuracy index was used to evaluate and analyze the price prediction results of the system. The results showed that the minimum mean absolute error of the system was 0.083 yuan/kg, the minimum mean percentage error was 3.95%, the minimum mean square error was 0.102 and the agricultural product price forecasting service system combining wavelet transform and BP neural network had better agricultural product price forecasting performance. At the same time, this also meant that the universality of this system could adapt to the price forecasting of a variety of vegetables and provide technical support for producers, operators, consumers and relevant government departments.",10.1109/CLOUD49709.2020.00009,G.

PrivacyScope: Automatic Analysis of Private Data Leakage in TEE-Protected Applications,2020,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Big data analytics is having a profound impact on many sectors of the economy by transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. However, increased use of sensitive business and private personal data with no or limited privacy safeguards has raised great concerns among individuals and government regulators. To address the growing tension between the need for data utility and the demand for data privacy, trusted execution environment (TEE) is being used in academic research as well as industrial application as a powerful primitive to enable confidential computation on the private data with only the result disclosed but not the original private data. While much of the current research has been focusing on protecting the TEE against attacks (e.g. side-channel information leakage), the security and privacy of the applications executing inside a TEE enclave has received little attention. The general attitude is that the application is running inside a trusted computing base (TCB), and therefore can be trusted. This assumption may not be valid when it comes to unverified third-party applications. In this paper, we present PrivacyScope, a static code analyzer designed to detect leakage of private data by an application code running in a TEE. PrivacyScope accomplishes this by analyzing the application code and identifying violations of a property called nonreversibility. We introduce nonreversibility since the classical noninterference property falls short of detecting private data leakage in certain scenarios, e.g., in machine learning (ML) programs where the program output is always related to (private) input data. Given its strict reliance on observable state, the noninterference falls short of detecting private data leakage in these situations. By design, PrivacyScope detects both explicit and implicit information leakage. The nonreversibility property is formally defined based on the noninterference property. Additionally, we describe the algorithms for PrivacyScope as extensions to the runtime semantics of a general language. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach and proof-of-feasibility prototype, we apply PrivacyScope to detect data leakage in select open-source ML code modules including linear regression, k-means clustering and collaborative filtering. Also, PrivacyScope can detect intentional data leakage code injected by a programmer. We responsibly disclosed all the discovered vulnerabilities leading to disclosure of private data in the open-source ML program we analyzed.",10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00013,R. Zhang; N. Zhang; A.

Data Linking as a Service: An Infrastructure for Generating and Publishing Linked Data on the Web,2020,-1,Outliers,0.1648293675261861,"Companies, government, and even ordinary people have been producing and publishing huge amounts of data. This phenomena, known as big data, leveraged the interest in advanced analytics and data science. Many observers, though, are pointing out that extracting knowledge from such datasets requires suitable tools for handling and integrating data. Research in the last years has shown that taking into account the semantics of data is crucial for fostering data integration solutions. However, there is a lack of solutions for data publishing that follow the best practices for exposing and connecting data. With this regard, this work proposed DLaaS, an infrastructure for generating and publishing linked data on the Web. It aims at facilitating the execution of necessary processes to properly publish high quality linked data.

Territorial Space Optimization Method Based on Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm and FLUS Model,2025,-1,Outliers,0.21927522064667462,"The rational planning of territorial space is related to the speed of economic development and the protection of ecology. There is an urgent need for a more advanced integrated territorial space layout method. For additional spatial layout design, the study suggests a multi-objective genetic algorithm based on spatial data prediction and coupled with land simulation modeling in the context of big data and machine learning development. The innovation of the research lies in the optimization of the multi-objective genetic algorithm by improving the crossover and mutation process of genetic operators, enhancing the adaptability of the algorithm in dynamic environments, and improving the prediction accuracy of the spatial quantity structure of the national territory. The outcomes revealed that this approach was applied to the prediction of populations of different sizes 400 and 600 with an average accuracy of 67%, which was 17% higher than that of the traditional genetic algorithm. The difference between the predicted and actual future spatial population values using the proposed algorithm was less than 2%, which was 56.5% lower than the other two prediction algorithms on average. The proposed land simulation model reached the highest accuracy at 100 iterations with an average fitness of  $2.4\times 10 ^{11}$ , which was 13% and 27% higher than the other two traditional neural network algorithms, respectively. In the two simple functions of f1 and f2, the highest convergence accuracy reached  $10^{-30}$  and  $10^{-10}$ , respectively. In the two more complicated functions of f3 and f4, the optimal solutions were approximated in the ranges of [ $10^{2}$ ,  $10^{12}$ ] and [ $10^{-2}$ ,  $10^{6}$ ] without significant fluctuations.

Reduced emissions of greenhouse gases are largely attributable to the agricultural sector. Governments worldwide are implementing laws to encourage the usage of low-carbon energy sources, which are becoming increasingly important due to the worsening impacts of climate change. The food and agriculture industries are utilising sensors and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to control processes, track quality, and ensure safety. WSNs facilitate real-time data collection and monitoring of environmental parameters, enhancing agricultural systems’ capacity to adapt to climate challenges. Because machine learning (ML) is currently being utilized to solve environmental concerns, it is an opportune time to explore ML models for CO2 projections from the agri-food sector. Additionally, the implementation of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) in WSNs allows for efficient management of data transmission, ensuring reliable data collection while reducing the risk of data loss. By enhancing our capacity to predict future energy demand and resource availability, the scientific community and businesses stand to gain substantially from artificial intelligence and big data analysis.

Attention-Driven CNN-LSTM Hybrid Models for Secure Dynamic Signature Verification,2025,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.23423621268324604,"Dynamic signature verification is a crucial biometric verification process, yet traditional methods are not very efficient in forgery detection and signature variation as they focus only on static signature features. In this paper, two hybrid deep learning models CNN-LSTM and CoAtNet are implemented to improve verification accuracy based on a signature's dynamic features such as spatial co-ordinates, pen pressure, velocity, acceleration etc. The hybrid CNN-LSTM works with both spatial and temporal patterns to extract meaningful patterns from dynamic data, while CoAtNet uses convolutional layers and transformer-based layers to perform stronger feature extraction using attention-based mechanisms. Two real world datasets, SIGNDUMP and SignatureFeatures dataset were used for experimentation and analysis. The results indicate that CNNLSTM is 99.22% accurate with big data and outperforms CoAtNet (97.90%). On the contrary, CoAtNet outperforms CNN-LSTM (94.89%) for small datasets and achieves 97.34% accuracy with SIGNDUMP. The findings exhibit the complementary abilities of the two architectures in signature verification. As a result, the proposed hybrid deep learning models enhance forgery detection and security of authentication significantly and are hence suitable for banking, legal verification, and government authentication systems. Future work may consider ensemble neural networks combining these approaches and other attention-based mechanisms for further performance enhancement.",10.1109/ICCSAI64074.2025.11064121,A. Kazi; V.

The Modern 3D Technologies as a Catalyst for the Digital Transformation of the Education and Industry,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.6722228651217392,"The digital transformation of the human world is an ongoing process that reshapes how everything around us is functioning. It is also the reflection of our growing dependence and reliance on the various technologies and solutions, which we use in our work, in our daily activities or to entertain ourselves, with the ultimate aim to solve our problems, to drive innovations and to create a better future. The digital transformation is not just the adoption of the new tools, systems or solutions, but the cultural and operational evolution, which is redefining the traditional operations and processes, and is representing how the governments, industries, organizations, companies, educational institutions and societies are changing their way of functioning, driven by the rapid advancement of the emerging technologies.

Robust Intelligent Malware Detection Using Deep Learning,2019,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Security breaches due to attacks by malicious software (malware) continue to escalate posing a major security concern in this digital age. With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Current malware detection solutions that adopt the static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven to be ineffective in identifying unknown malwares in real-time. Recent malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive techniques to change the malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares. Such new malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are being employed recently to conduct an effective malware analysis. However, such approaches are time consuming as they require extensive feature engineering, feature learning, and feature representation. By using the advanced MLAs such as deep learning, the feature engineering phase can be completely avoided. Recently reported research studies in this direction show the performance of their algorithms with a biased training data, which limits their practical use in real-time situations. There is a compelling need to mitigate bias and evaluate these methods independently in order to arrive at a new enhanced method for effective zero-day malware detection. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper, first, evaluates the classical MLAs and deep learning architectures for malware detection, classification, and categorization using different public and private datasets. Second, we remove all the dataset bias removed in the experimental analysis by having different splits of the public and private datasets to train and test the model in a disjoint way using different timescales. Third, our major contribution is in proposing a novel image processing technique with optimal parameters for MLAs and deep learning architectures to arrive at an effective zero-day malware detection model. A comprehensive comparative study of our model demonstrates that our proposed deep learning architectures outperform classical MLAs. Our novelty in combining visualization and deep learning architectures for static, dynamic, and image processing-based hybrid approach applied in a big data environment is the first of its kind toward achieving robust intelligent zero-day malware detection. Overall, this paper paves way for an effective visual detection of malware using a scalable and hybrid deep learning framework for real-time deployments.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2906934,R.

Adaptive Modulation Based on Nondata-Aided Error Vector Magnitude for Smart Systems in Smart Cities,2023,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.48547641132136565,"A smart city involves big data transmission (BDT) between smart systems, which increases queue delays and leads to difficulty in enhancing the spectral efficiency. Adaptive modulation is an effective technique for enhancing data transmission rates in smart systems. However, traditional adaptive modulation approaches are not suitable for BDT in smart systems because the delays caused by the large amount of transmitted data lead to difficulty in evaluating the channel quality. In this article, we propose a nondata-aided error vector (NDA-EVM) that can be employed in adaptive modulation over wireless channels. The proposed NDA-EVM can be used to evaluate the channel quality and symbol error rate (SER), which reflect the quality of service (QoS) of the system. We formulated the relationship between the NDA-EVM and SER, which provides a basis for designing adaptive modulation techniques for smart systems. To address the low average spectrum efficiency (ASE) caused by BDT queue delays, an adaptive modulation strategy based on the finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) of the NDA-EVM [i.e., NDA-EVM adaptive modulation (NDA-EVM-AM)] was designed. This method simplifies the adaptive modulation algorithm for smart systems to search for the optimal transfer probability in the FSMC matrix based on two typical states: 1) the resident state and 2) transient state. Moreover, we proposed an analytical procedure to describe queuing behavior to analyze the performance of the NDA-EVM-AM algorithm for smart systems in smart cities. The performance is compared with that of a conventional adaptive modulation algorithm through simulations. The results show that compared with traditional adaptive modulation, NDA-EVM-AM obtains a lower packet loss rate and higher spectral efficiency for smart systems.",10.1109/JIOT.2023.3268659,F.

Comprehensive Review on Development of Smart Cities Using Industry 4.0 Technologies,2023,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Smart Cities (SCs) have recently opened new lifestyles as they introduce effective approaches for improving urban management. These cities integrate Industry 4.0 technologies and new organizations into a social and technical system. A Smart City (SC) finally aims to integrate urban business, transportation, water, energy, and other subsystems by analyzing the data collected from sensors and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). In this regard, the current article proposes a hybrid structure based on Cloud Computing (CC), cloud processing, and internet technology to develop and manage SCs and urban planning. Moreover, the development and analysis of sensors to construct an SC, as well as supporting technologies, are addressed. Therefore, the present research is focused on defining and reviewing large data and objects of the Internet and CC to identify the current challenges and limitations. This research, thus, introduced a novel approach in the context of the Internet of objects, whose data are gathered from different geographic locations through devices and sensors to be used in a new system. CC services in a city can analyze and make smart decisions to optimally manage SCs and improve the welfare of citizens.

RemBit: a blockchain based solution for remittances to Ethiopia,2019,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Since its introduction in the Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper published in 2008, blockchain technology has been seen as a great opportunity to enable new business scenarios both for developed and developing countries. Considering that digital alternative payment methods represent a key factor to the smart cities development, in this study we propose an innovative payment solution aimed at improving the remittance flows by exploiting the potential of blockchain technology. Traditional banking remittance systems are characterized by high transaction fees and long transfer times, therefore they encourage the adoption of informal channels for money transfer with consequent losses in the economic system. By focusing our interest in a specific country of Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia, we launch an innovative blockchain based system able to make the remittance process safer, faster and to allow secure and reliable transactions between the counterparts in data sharing. We describe its architecture, which enables a secure management of big data and the different stages of solution design. Furthermore, the system guarantees the compliance with the Ethiopian government's recommendations on the matter, in particular it allows to encourage formal data collection on remittances and to support the introduction of new technology in the payments system.

The role of sensors in Society 5.0 is critical. Sensors and the Internet of Things can be considered to work as a service system. Specifically, sensors can track millions of objects to support city security. This article considers the competitive sensor networks in terms of Quality of Service, which can be quantified by service price. The sensors are modeled as an $M/M/1/n$ queueing service system with a location on a secured grid area. A competitive admission fee is considered for tracking orders from society, which makes the arriving tracking demands price-sensitive. Moreover, a bi-level nonlinear program is developed wherein the first level maximizes the sensors’ revenue and social benefit revenue while also minimizing the wait time of tracking orders from society; in the second level, the expected damage cost is minimized from a disruptive scenario toward valuable infrastructure.

Social Network Polluting Contents Detection through Deep Learning Techniques,2019,3,Topic_3_social_media_social media,1.0,"Nowadays social networks are widespread used not only to enable users to share comments with other users but also as tool from which is possible to extract knowledge. As a matter of fact, social networks are increasingly considered to understand the opinion trend about a politician or related to a certain event that occurred: in general social networks have been proved useful to understand the public opinion from both governments and companies. In addition, also from the end users point of view it is difficult to identify real contents. This is the reason why in last years we are witnessing a growing interest in tools for analyzing big data gathered from social networks in order to find common opinions. In this context, content polluters on social networks make the opinion mining process difficult to browse valuable contents. In this paper we propose a method aimed to discriminate between pollute and real information from a semantic point of view.

Where the dependency is more, the security risks increases and as known cyber-attacks on network communication has increased over a decade against organization firms, government firms and even individuals. Currently, shielding private data, research data and maintaining confidentiality is a critical problem. Hence, it is necessary to develop an intrusion detection system to identify various unknown attacks. As the data flow in network is continuous, capturing it results in huge volume of data so, we need big data technologies like Apache Spark to handle those data and give us the information in short period of time. Machine learning is a powerful investigation structure to distinguish odd occasions happened in the system traffic stream. In this work, we developed Apache Spark and Machine Learning based Network Intrusion detection system which is capable of analyzing the huge data from the network traffic data.

An Improved Large Scale Data Analytics for Smart Cities with Multimodal Data Fusion,2023,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.3505304051369749,"Massive amounts of data are produced by smart cities from a variety of sources, including sensors, social media, and IoT devices. The data analysis can offer insightful information for raising the quality of life and improving urban services. However, data fusion and analysis are made more difficult by the large-scale nature of smart city data. An improved method for big data analytics for smart cities is presented in this abstract, with a particular emphasis on the fusion and analysis of multimodal data. Integrating heterogeneous data from several sources, such as text, photos, videos, and sensor measurements, is known as multimodal data fusion. A more complete understanding of the city can be attained by merging these many data modalities. To establish a single representation for analysis, the fusion process uses feature extraction, data preprocessing, and integration techniques. There are several opportunities created by the analysis of multimodal data in smart cities. It makes it possible to find intricate patterns like social behavior, environmental pollution, and traffic congestion. Predictive models that foretell future occurrences and optimize resource allocation can be constructed by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques. Additionally, data analytics may support decision-making by giving city officials and urban planners up-to-the-minute information and practical advice. To create strong data analytics frameworks and integrate them into the architecture of smart cities, interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists, urban designers, subject matter experts, and policymakers is necessary.

Security Analysis in Context-Aware Distributed Storage and Query Processing in Hybrid Cloud Framework,2019,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Recent studies have shown that several government and business organizations experience huge data breaches. Data breaches increase in a daily basis. The main target for attackers is organization sensitive data which includes personal identifiable information (PII) such as social security number (SSN), date of birth (DOB) and credit card /debit card (CCDC). The other target is encryption/decryption keys or passwords to get access to the sensitive data. The cloud computing is emerging as a solution to store, transfer and process the data in a distributed location over the Internet. Big data and internet of things (IoT) increased the possibility of sensitive data exposure. Most methods used for the attack are hacking, unauthorized access, insider theft and false data injection on the move. Most of the attacks happen during three different states of data life cycle such as data-at-rest, data-in-use, and data-in-transit. Hence, protecting sensitive data at all states particularly when data is moving to cloud computing environment needs special attention. The main purpose of this research is to analyze risks caused by data breaches, personal and organizational weaknesses to protect sensitive data and privacy. The paper discusses methods such as data classification and data encryption at different states to protect personal and organizational sensitive data. The paper also presents mathematical analysis by leveraging the concept of birthday paradox to demonstrate the encryption key attack. The analysis result shows that the use of same keys to encrypt sensitive data at different data states make the sensitive data less secure than using different keys. Our results show that to improve the security of sensitive data and to reduce the data breaches, different keys should be used in different states of the data life cycle.",10.1109/CCWC.2019.8666498,G.

A Sensor-Based Data Analytics for Patient Monitoring in Connected Healthcare Applications,2021,-1,Outliers,0.3063788806447418,"Nowadays, keeping a strong and good health is one of the main concern of the general public or governments. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been emerged as an efficient solution to build smart healthcare systems deployed either at hospitals or in-home. Such networks rely on biomedical sensors which are used in electronics-based medical equipment to remotely collect vital signs of patients (pressure, temperature, hart rate, oxygen saturation etc.). Generally, these biosensors are implemented on or inside the patient's body and take three types of record data such as numerical, images and videos. However, the big data collected by various biomedical sensors along with the need of emergency detection, the limited sensor energies, and the prediction of the progress of patient situation are the major challenges for health-based IoT applications.

Encryption Switching Service: Securely Switch Your Encrypted Data to Another Format,2021,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.8470477226743708,"Big data analytics has been regarded as a promising technology to yield better insights into future development by government and industry. Data collection and aggregation are necessary pre-steps to enable data analysis. However, data may be dispersed across multiple places and in different formats. Even worse, data can be encrypted under various encryption mechanisms when data owners try to secure the confidentiality of the data. This makes data aggregation extremely challenging, if not impossible, especially when the encryption keys cannot be shared for various reasons. In this paper, we take the first step in addressing this problem. More specifically, we propose a new notion of cross-domain encryption switching service that securely bridges two well-studied encryption mechanisms, namely traditional public key encryption and identity-based encryption. As of independent interest, our notion supports keyword search over encrypted data, i.e., after encryption switching one may search over the (outsourced) data without loss of data and query secrecy. We provide a provably-secure instantiation satisfying the notion, and further present the efficiency analysis to show the scalability.

Smart city cyber systems carry critical data beginning with the simple sensor data captured by IoT devices up to and including providing the essential services and commands dependent upon that data. The broad reliance upon IoT in smart cities significantly increases the attack surface of the already large, complex, and heterogeneous smart city system by making each and every IoT device and its communications a potential entry point into the system. Our proposed framework utilizes Black Network protocols and key management to secure the most vulnerable, and typically unsecured, IoT communications. The framework utilizes a hierarchical, distributed architecture with pooled resources to prevent single points of failure and to sandbox attack impacts. This hierarchy allows AI enabled management tools to be placed both near the IoT edge using localized data and in the Big Data collections.

Quality Estimation for Scarce Scenarios Within Mobile Crowdsensing Systems,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.48064155187593277,"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a paradigm that exploits the presence of a crowd of moving human participants to acquire, or generate, data from their environment. As a part of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm, MCS serves the quest for a more efficient operation of a smart city. Big data techniques employed on this data produce inferences about the participants' environment, the smart city. However, sufficient amounts of data are not always available. Sometimes, the available data are scarce as it is obtained at different times, locations, and from different MCS participants who may not be present. As a consequence, the scale of data acquired may be small and susceptible to errors. In such scenarios, the MCS system requires techniques that acquire reliable inferences from such limited data sets. To that end, we resort to small data (SD) techniques that are relevant for scarce and erroneous scenarios. In this article, we discuss SD and propose schemes to tackle the problems associated with such limited data sets, in the context of the smart city. We propose two novel quality metrics: 1) MAD quality metric (MAD-Q) and 2) MAD bootstrap quality metric (MADBS-Q), to deal with SD, focusing on evaluating the quality of a data set within MCS. We also propose an MCS-specific coverage metric that combines the spatial dimension with MAD-Q and MADBS-Q.

Do Non-competing Data Intermediaries Matter? A Property Rights Perspective,2023,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"In the era of big data, data transactions are getting increasingly common and intricate. Our study explores the phenomenon of government-oriented data intermediaries, which act as platforms to facilitate data transactions and enhance social welfare in China. Our study contributes by applying two-sided market theory to compare the performance of these intermediaries with one-to-one data transactions, and by analyzing how property rights are determined and allocated in data transactions on government-oriented data intermediaries. We find that centralized property rights enforcement adopted by Chinese data intermediaries lowers transaction costs and agency problems, reduces information asymmetry and bargaining power imbalance, providing a fair and efficient trading environment for data suppliers and demanders. In this way, Chinese government ensures data security and credibility, safeguards data suppliers’ ownership and control rights, and regulates data demanders’ usage rights and restrictions, and minimizes conflicts and disputes. By promoting data sharing and exchange, the framework of government-oriented data intermediaries will stimulate innovation and economic growth in China.

Hadoop is the most mature open source big data processing framework, which implements the MapReduce programming paradigm. The mass source data are stored in HDFS supported by Hadoop and processed parallelly in computing nodes of a cluster. However, in many cases, the source data is simultaneously distributed across multiple data centers(Geo-distributed). Existing deployment research, merely focusing on moving all data to one data center to process, is often limited by the size of input data and the network transmission capacity between data centers, resulting in a lethal impact on the performance of big data processing. In this paper, we deal with Geo-distributed data sets, analyze possible cluster deployment way and then select the optimal one with the proposed cluster deployment optimization framework. We introduce decision making algorithm that the optimization framework relies on to determine an optimized cluster deployment way.

Research on Understanding and Improving Deep Hashing Retrieval under Incremental Data,2025,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.26881656927725833,"Purpose-The rapid growth of industries such as smart cities, intelligent transportation, and the Internet of Things has led to an explosion of big data, making data retrieval a pivotal basic technology for numerous practical applications. The objective is to facilitate faster and more accurate retrieval of relevant data to realize intelligent data services. Among these, deep hash-based cross-modal data retrieval with incremental learning has garnered significant attention for its vast application potential and has also captured the interest of industry professionals and technologists.Design/methodology/approach-This study approaches the understanding and enhancement of data retrieval models from the angles of data, characteristics, and coding within practical application systems. The further comprehension of the retrieval model is primarily exemplified by: 1. A deeper understanding of dynamic depth models. Deep models are often viewed as black boxes, yet dynamically changing data necessitates the further integration of multiple deep retrieval models. This project aims to investigate and comprehend the connectivity of dynamic depth models, drawing from the concept of mode connectivity in loss landscapes within existing deep networks, to provide a more robust theoretical explanation for data retrieval models under dynamic changes. 2. A more profound understanding of the retrieval capabilities of hash coding. The loss of information during the hash binary coding process is a significant bottleneck contributing to the decline in retrieval performance. This project endeavors to define the retrieval capability from a quantitative perspective and to elucidate the reasons behind the weaker retrieval ability of hash coding, thereby enabling researchers to gain a more nuanced understanding. Based on these insights, the enhancement of the retrieval model is primarily reflected in: The improvement of the feature expression ability of the dynamic depth model, exploring linear connectivity, attention-based connectivity, and non-linear connectivity methods; and the enhancement of the retrieval ability of hash coding, researching approaches from Bayesian methods and segmented coding, among others.Findings-In conclusion, deep Hashing holds clear scientific significance and promising application prospects, with the potential to support critical practical applications such as human-machine dialogue, intelligent transportation, smart healthcare, and government governance.Practical impliactions-The multimodal hash retrieval technique and object keypoint positioning technique examined in this paper can be utilized to automatically identify object keypoints (e.g., locating the eyes, nose, and chin in a facial image).This task is a fundamental technology for various computer applications, including face recognition, object tracking, and pose estimation. The precise positioning of object keypoints is a fundamental problem with far-reaching social and economic impacts, applicable to fine portrait analysis technology, commodity search, security systems, image recognition, machine translation, identity verification, intelligent case processing, intelligent transportation, intelligent finance, intelligent education, intelligent manufacturing, and big data governance, among other systems.Originality/value-With the advent of new generations of technological revolutions in artificial intelligence and big data, any breakthrough in related technologies portends immeasurable commercial value and societal benefits (such as chatGPT and GPT-4o technologies).",10.1109/IDSAC65763.2025.11170201,M.

Analyzing such academic big data and discovering knowledge can discover comprehensive and predictive academic intelligence and provide corresponding services, which are valuable for scholars, journals, institutions and governments for career assessment, topic selection, funding management and resource allocation. This paper proposes a heterogeneous knowledge-learning method for understanding and predicting academic impact in the transportation field. The proposed method is illustrated on the academic big data collected from the papers published in 34 transportation journals from 2008 to 2018. We extract four types of features including bibliometric, altmetric, network and semantic features, and build hybrid feature embedding via TransR and Doc2vec that involving domain knowledge. Further, an academic impact prediction model for articles named as Hy-LSTM-Att is proposed, which weighs the hybrid features by the attention mechanism and predicts academic impact with the bi-LSTM recurrent neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Hy-LSTM-Att model outperforms competing shallow and deep learning models.

Efficient Privacy-Preserving Outsourcing of Large-Scale Convex Separable Programming for Smart Cities,2016,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.9084204241802278,"One of the most salient features of smart city is to utilize big data to make our lives more convenient and more intelligent. This is usually achieved through solving a series of large-scale common and fundamental problems such as linear systems of equations, linear programs, etc. However, it is a very challenging task for resource-limited clients and small companies to solve such problems as the data volume keeps increasing. With cloud computing, an alternative is to solve complex problems by outsourcing them to the cloud. Nonetheless, data privacy is one of the main concerns. Many previous works on privacy-preserving outsourcing are based on cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption and have very high computational complexity, which may not be practical for big data applications. In this paper, we design an efficient privacy-preserving outsourcing algorithm based on arithmetic operations only for large-scale convex separable programming problems. Specifically, we first develop an efficient transformation scheme to preserve data privacy. Then we linearize the convex functions with arbitrary accuracy and solve the problem by outsourcing it to the cloud. The client can efficiently verify the correctness of the returned results to prevent any malicious behavior of the cloud.

First, we demonstrate that the moving preference of individuals can be exploited to perform re-identification attacks, which may cause serious damage to the identity privacy of users. To address this re-identification problem, we present a new trajectory anonymity model, in which the degree of correlation between parking locations and individuals is precisely characterized by a concept of Location Frequency-inverse user frequency (LF-IUF, for short). We then propose an anonymizing method to replace parking locations by a k-correlation region.

UbeHealth: A Personalized Ubiquitous Cloud and Edge-Enabled Networked Healthcare System for Smart Cities,2018,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.28814272931596013,"Smart city advancements are driving massive transformations of healthcare, the largest global industry. The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers.

"Evaluation of Smart Agitation Prediction and Management for Dementia Care and Novel Universal Village Oriented Solution for Integration, Resilience, Inclusiveness and Sustainability",2022,-1,Outliers,0.1368381067329261,"At present, the world is being faced with the challenge of an aging population, correlating to a growing number of seniors with dementia. With this uptick in persons with dementia (PWD), managing dementia-induced agitation, a behavior present in 90 precent of PWD characterized by physical aggression, verbal outburst, or other troubling behavior, is a pressing issue [1]. Caregiver burden associated with agitation is one of the leading causes a community-based PWD is institutionalized [2], so by supporting PWD-caregiver dyads, we improve individual quality of life and relieve stress placed on the global healthcare system. Use of AI technology, big data, and integrated networks of wearable and ambient sensors has enabled continuous monitoring of dementia care. However, most methods focus on data collection at the early stages of dementia. More research is needed on how novel technologies can empower PWD and their caregivers to take action to manage agitation and support them in the long term as symptoms progress. Moreover, current methods have not taken full advantage of the information obtained and do not provide personalized care. In this paper, we use the Universal Village (UV) perspective to evaluate the current status of smart technologies with the potential for use in preventing and mitigating agitation while providing support to the caregiver. We conduct evaluations based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that a robust PWD agitation management system should take into consideration the interaction between the smart healthcare system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart response system for city emergency, smart environmental protection and smart humanity, and also study how managing agitation would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study will help us explore in depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design. As such, the novel framework will improve PWD quality of life and reduce the care burden for formal and informal caregivers through continuous, unobtrusive monitoring, life-long agitation management throughout different stages of dementia, PWD-caregiver dyad-specific guidance, preventive healthcare, and timely treatment.",10.1109/UV56588.2022.10185497,K.

Building a Security Framework for Smart Cities: A Case Study from UAE,2020,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.6334270740416535,"Smart cities have evolved in the last years, leading the cities to implement initiatives related to technical aspects to improve quality of life. City-rankings have become a central tool for assessing the attractiveness of urban regions. The development of smart cities, however, is not without risk. Cities and citizens are putting more and more responsibilities in urban systems. Hence, all key stakeholders should provide an effective safety and security response to any situation affecting their citizens or organizations. Special attention should be paid with respect to development of services aimed at reducing cybercrime. To prevent this, we believe that a better understanding of smart cities and their privacy implications is needed. The paper provides an overview of security aspects of a cyber security in smart cities. It starts with exploration of various definitions, threats, and risks in cyber security as well as threats from environments both internal and external and how these threats are currently mitigated with tools, processes and technologies as smart cities utilizes IoT with big data. Presently, most of the data is transmitted and collected online. Hackers usually try to exploit the vulnerabilities using various tools in order to know more about the customers and then misuse the customer's information. Enterprises, on the other hand, continue to collect more information in order to improve services, infrastructure, and security. They collect tons of data from customers in order to complete their requirements for the different services they provide. The main concern with the collected data is that it can be vulnerable to misuse by hackers. Building a security framework based on concepts and repositories of big data and leveraging on the intelligence of predictive analytics can help build a security system that can counter these threats and help to guard from these risk and threats to a large extent. Various concepts, applications, and technologies interact to cover every aspect of the digital citizen's life. Understanding this privacy-challenging environment is the basic requirement for the development of effective protection mechanisms. Thus, the paper aims to address sentiments on cyber security technologies and cybercrime awareness in order to come up with recommendations for innovative solutions.

Integrating ‘Big’ geoscience data into the petascale national environmental research interoperability platform (NERDIP): Successes and unforeseen challenges,2015,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.15310382685338098,"The Australian Government has begun an initiative to organise publicly funded national data assets and make them accessible for research through the Research Data Services initiative (RDS), which supports over 40 PBytes of multidisciplinary data at eight nodes around Australia. One of these nodes is at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) that provides a national comprehensively integrated high performance computing facility. NCI is a partnership between the ANU, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Commonwealth Science and Industry Research Organisation (CSIRO) and particularly focuses on Earth system sciences. As part of its activity in RDS, NCI has collocated over 10 PBytes of priority research data collections spanning a wide range of disciplines from geosciences, geophysics, environment, climate, weather, and water resources, through to astronomy, bioinformatics, and the social sciences. To facilitate access, maximise reuse and enable integration across the disciplines, data have been built into a platform that NCI has called, the National Environmental Research Data Interoperability Platform (NERDIP). The platform is co-located with the significant HPC resources: a 1.2 PetaFlop supercomputer (Raijin), and a HPC class 3000 core OpenStack cloud system (Tenjin). Combined, they offer unparalleled opportunities for geosciences researchers to undertake innovative Data-intensive Science at scales and resolutions never before attempted, as well as enabling participation in new collaborations in interdisciplinary science. However, compared with other `Big Data' science disciplines (climate, oceans, weather, astronomy), current geoscience data management practices and data access methods need significant work to be able to scale-up and thus to take advantage of the changes in the global computing landscape. Although the geosciences have many `Big Data' collections that could be incorporated within NERDIP, they typically comprise heterogeneous files that are distributed over multiple sites and sectors, and it is taking considerable time to aggregate these into large High Performance Data (HPD) sets that are structured to facilitate uptake in HPC environments. Once incorporated into NERDIP, the next challenge is to ensure that researchers are ready to both use modern tools, and to update their working practises so as to process these data effectively. This is an issue in part because the geoscience community has been slow to move to peak-class systems for Data-intensive Science and integrate with the rest of the Earth systems community.",10.1109/BigData.2015.7363981,L.

As a result, Intelligent Home Energy Management Systems are vital for smart city and smart home energy efficiency optimisation. Unfortunately, there aren't many low-cost, easy-to-implement, and low-maintenance solutions available, which is preventing their widespread adoption. There are also difficulties in storing, managing, and analysing the massive amounts of data produced from many sources. Big Data and the IoT provide scalable answers to these problems by allowing us to sense, monitor, and control the energy consumption in our homes. Preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training are the three steps that make up the proposed Intelligent Home Energy Management System. Before offline feature extraction and grouping, normalisation is used as a preprocessing step. BO-BiLSTM is used to train the model, which improves the accuracy of predictions. With better efficiency and scalability, the suggested method beats the standard BiLSTM and BO-LSTM models, according to the results.

Protecting the location privacy of mobile social media users,2016,-1,Outliers,0.19909826532079558,"Unprecedented volumes of location-based information have been produced as a result of the widespread adoption of social network applications and GPS-enabled devices and sensors. Publication of such location data can provide valuable resources for researchers and government agencies in applications ranging from near real-time population-wide health monitoring to planning for future cities. However, such data hold personally identifying information, which gives rise to many privacy issues. There is thus a pressing need for ways to restrict this inherently identifying location-related information, however ideally we would like to preserve the utility of the data. Importantly, any such solution has to be scalable to large population-wide data scenarios. To tackle this, we introduce a novel differentially private hierarchical location sanitization (DPHLS) approach based on the concept “(α, r)-dataset” implemented through a Variable Order Mobility Markov Model (VO3M). We show how this system allows individual locations in personal trajectories to be protected using selection and frequency perturbation mechanisms using the “(α, r)-dataset”, leveraging past (published) location histories to obfuscate the user location in a flexible and controllable manner. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution is evaluated through the big data experiments that have been carried out using an OpenStack-based Cloud and Apache Sparkbased platform utilising large-scale social media trajectories. The experimental results suggest that the privacy publication algorithm can successfully scale to big data scenarios whilst retaining the utility of the datasets (trajectories) and preserving individual user privacy.",10.1109/BigData.2016.7840718,S.

Smart Infrastructure: Solutions to Improve Privacy and Security,2020,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"The development and implementation of smart infrastructure raises legitimate security and privacy concerns for both the specific users of these systems as well as the public at large. The consolidation of big data through smart applications within smart infrastructure systems allows large tech companies and government entities to gather and potentially exploit the personal information of consumers. These powerful organizations collect consumer data in order to perform analysis on it, trade or sell it, or simply store it for later use. The gathering of big data or metadata, data about data, provides an opportunity for the collector to observe or predict the behaviors of specific individuals or groups. Those holding this information could use it to promote their own agendas or to otherwise exploit those from whom it has been collected without their knowledge or consent. Additionally, the current lack of legislation and policies concerning the security of smart applications or IoT devices makes the possibility of security and privacy breaches more prevalent. A breach would allow access to sensitive information which would be a threat to security and privacy at an individual and/or national scale. Due to the dynamic nature of smart infrastructure, we employed a systems analysis of this problem as a methodological approach leading to three solutions. We recommend a three-part solution-based analysis, consisting of 1.) Financial Backing 2.) Creation of Policies and Regulations and 3.) Technical Integration. This solution addresses market mitigation, data privacy for consumers, and data authentication between smart technologies and critical infrastructure.

We conduct a comparative analysis of these methods using a real benchmark data set and additional data with known anomalies, used as ground truth data, to verify the correctness of the methods. We synthetically generate additional data from the real data set by automatically injecting anomalies based on specific patterns of anomalous behavior identified for the public street lighting domain. We examine the clustering methods’ performance by calculating their accuracy in detecting synthetic anomalies, as well as their computation cost. The experiments show that while K-means runs faster, DBSCAN is more accurate than K-means and OPTICS in detecting synthetic anomalies.",10.1109/TCE.2024.3354189,M. Ali; P. Scandurra; F. Moretti; H.

Towards Informing Human-Centric ICT Standardization for Data-Driven Societies,2018,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.38935987204304356,"Information and communication technology (ICT) standards play a crucial role towards harnessing technological developments and shaping the technology landscape. ICT standards development is largely driven by standards developing organizations or standards setting organizations that represent and are informed by the perspectives and interests of the ICT private sector and the public sector. Thus the shaping of the standards is mostly driven by the business, technical, and legal impetus, towards facilitating greater market influence, coordination, integration, interoperability, and legal conformity. The technocentric, business-focused perspective to ICT developments, and corollary to ICT standards development, is distinct from and can be orthogonal to the human-centric perspective that elevates the role and centrality of the human concerns over the technology and business concerns. Notwithstanding the crucial role of business and technology, it remains that at the centre of the 21st century data-driven societies are individuals and end-users who are the primary actants and agents within the technology and data ecosystems. This gives motivation for infusing the human perspectives and values into technology development as well as into ICT standards development. This is more pronounced for cases where the business and technocentric interests are at odds and opposed to the human interests, such as, the need for increased datafication to support Big Data developments versus the need for individuals' privacy preservation. In this research, which is framed through a case study of personal health informatics in the context of sustainable development (i.e., sustainable development goal on “health and wellbeing” – SDG3) indicators monitoring, we have undertaken a survey to investigate the human-centric values and attitudes associated with the collection and use of personal data. From this inquiry, the paper highlights and surfaces: individuals attitudes and perceptions around monitoring of social indicators; key considerations associated with data ownership, privacy and confidentiality of data, as well as sharing of personal data within the data ecosystem. The paper then discusses how these findings could inform and be infused into the development of technology artefacts and standards, towards a realization of more human-centric data-informed societies.",10.13052/jicts2245-800X.631,M.

These devices are now available; although, a small percentage of SMEs are taking privileges of the technologies’ capabilities towards successful SMEs with high productivity. These researches show, poor growth of IoE-Education in SMEs is due to the lack of sufficient knowledge and skills in the Human Resources to apply the relevant techniques. Identifying and defining the competencies required to utilize these technologies and incorporate it into job competencies along with appropriate planning for Human Resources Development is one of the essentials of today’s business.

Goal-Driven Context-Aware Data Filtering in IoT-Based Systems,2015,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"One of the crucial research issues in an IoT-based system is how to manage the huge amount of data transmitted by the potentially large number of sensors that form the system. Prior research has focused on centralized cloud-based ""Big Data"" architectures for collecting, collating and analyzing the data. However, most of these scenarios accumulate thousands of petabytes in a short period of time, increasing the demand for more storage, and also slowing down speed of data analysis. Hence for real-time scenarios, e.g., agricultural crop tracking, traffic management, etc., such an approach would be impractical. Moreover, depending on the context in which the data is generated and is to be used, only a fraction of the data would be needed for analysis. Therefore, the challenges are to determine which data to keep and which to discard for both short term and long term usage, and define the contextual parameters along which this filtering is to be done. Hence one key problem addressed in this paper is how to define what data the user needs so that filtering algorithms can be defined to extract the data needed. To that end, in this paper, we present a goal driven, context-aware data filtering, transforming and integration approach for IoT-based systems. We propose a data warehouse-based data model for specifying the data needed at particular levels of granularity and frequency, that drive data storage and representation (aligned with the Semantic Sensor Network ontology). Throughout our paper, we illustrate our ideas via a realistic running example in the smart city domain, with emphasis on traffic management, and also present a proof of concept prototype.",10.1109/ITSC.2015.351,N.

Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this position paper is fivefold. First, we review the technological attributes and platforms proposed in the current literature for the standing-alone FC and IoE paradigms.

Real-Time Traffic Pattern Collection and Analysis Model for Intelligent Traffic Intersection,2018,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7197911287974968,"The traffic congestion hits most big cities in the world - threatening long delays and serious reductions in air quality. City and local government officials continue to face challenges in optimizing crowd flow, synchronizing traffic and mitigating threats or dangerous situations. One of the major challenges faced by city planners and traffic engineers is developing a robust traffic controller that eliminates traffic congestion and imbalanced traffic flow at intersections. Ensuring that traffic moves smoothly and minimizing the waiting time in intersections requires automated vehicle detection techniques for controlling the traffic light automatically, which are still challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic pattern collection and analysis model, named TPCAM, based on traffic cameras to help in smooth vehicular movement on junctions and set to reduce the traffic congestion. Our traffic detection and pattern analysis model aims at detecting and calculating the traffic flux of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections in real-time. Our system can utilize one camera to capture all the traffic flows in one intersection instead of multiple cameras, which will reduce the infrastructure requirement and potential for easy deployment. We propose a new deep learning model based on YOLOv2 and adapt the model for the traffic detection scenarios. To reduce the network burdens and eliminate the deployment of network backbone at the intersections, we propose to process the traffic video data at the network edge without transmitting the big data back to the cloud. To improve the processing frame rate at the edge, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions.

Recent developments in the IT industry have led to the growth of digital data in various fields like medical, government offices, education sector, banks, social media, digital library, and so on. Advancement in the recent technologies has paved their way to convert the traditional offices into paperless offices. Also, the growth of digital libraries, e-governance, and internet based applications has led to the increase in the volume of digital data, which mainly include texts, graphs, images, audio and video as various components in the document image by resulting in the development of complex document images, which are used for archival and transmission on regular basis.

Landmarks-based Blocking Method For Large-scale Entity Resolution,2020,-1,Outliers,0.16677921454311379,"Large-scale entity resolution (ER) techniques have received tremendous attention due to the emergence of data processing within organizations and governments. The traditional ER process requires pairwise comparisons between each record when identifying records belong to the same entity, which is computationally prohibitive for large databases.

Reliability Improvement of Rainwater-Drainage System Using IoT and AI,2024,-1,Outliers,0.14122636604372177,"Japanese-government data on the degree of damage by flood type indicates that inland floods cause the highest recorded damage every year, without the occurrence of large-scale damage due to levee breaches. Therefore, research on improving rainwater-drainage systems is important for damage prevention for inland flooding A conventional rainwater-drainage operation scheme is called “water-level control,” where a pump is started-up/stopped when the drainage-water level of the pump-well reaches a given threshold. To prevent inland flooding caused by heavy rain, the drainage-pump operator sometimes manually manipulates the water-level control and starts-up the pump before the rainwater level reaches the threshold. Notably, conventional rainwater-drainage system pumps have never been operated by applying rain-forecast big data, which is one of the factors that make rainwater-drainage systems unreliable. Our research focuses on improving the reliability of an autonomous system using IoT and rain-forecast big data. This paper describes the design of our improved rainwater-drainage system and discusses the verification results of the system's inland flood-damage prevention through drainage experiments and inland-flood analysis. These verification results show that even an improved system is insufficient for reducing inland flood damage.

Interfacial Microstructure Evolution of Indium Jointed with Different Surface Finishes after Thermal Treatments,2022,7,Topic_7_energy_power_data,0.32062150452097354,"High performance computing (HPC) products market is growing to meet current and future demands in business, government, engineering, and science. HPC system can process big data and perform complex calculation at high speeds, where the system also generates a lot of heat continuously. The accumulated heat needs to be managed to avoid affecting the performance and lifetime of HPC system. Therefore, a key design and development of HPC products is to achieve high thermal dissipation in electronic devices. The application of thermal interface materials (TIMs) has been a promising thermal dissipation solution for electronic devices. However, the thermal conductivities of current silicone-based TIMs have been insufficient for future products. Indium is a potential candidate for high heat dissipation needs, because the thermal conductivity of pure indium is around 86 W/mK, which is higher than most silicone-based TIMs. When indium has been applied as a metallic TIM and jointed with the metal of surface finish, there is an intermetallic compound (IMC) reaction at the interface of indium joint. The phase and microstructure of IMC depend on the conditions of thermal treatments and the type of surface finish. The interfacial condition of indium joint is the key to heat dissipation performance. Therefore, the interfacial mechanism of indium joints have been investigated by applying different surface finishes and various heat treatments in this study.In this paper, the interfacial reactions of indium jointed with different surface finishes (Au/Ni(V) and Au/Ni) have been investigated, respectively. For studying the interfacial microstructure evolution of the indium joints, they have been treated with different thermal treatments, including reflow process (with 245°C peak temperature) and high temperature storage tests (aging at 100°C, 125°C, and 150°C for 250~1000 hours). The interfacial morphologies of indium joint and the growth behaviors of IMC have been observed, and the interfacial IMC has been identified as Ni28 In72 phase. For Au/Ni(V) surface finish, there is rock shaped IMC grains on the surface of Ni(V) layer, and the grain size of IMC increases with the increase of the reflow cycle. In Ni(V) layer, there is a significant In/Ni inter-diffusion reaction after different thermal treatments.

It is anticipated that newer technologies, like the Internet of Things and cloud computation, will take advantage of this progress and expand the use of AI and robotics in agriculture. Big Data, which refers to vast quantities of diverse data that may be collected, examined, and used to judgement call, encompasses this concept. With the help of this study, you can learn about the most recent Big Data applications for smart farming and discover the associated societal inequalities that need to be resolved. A framework for analysis was created using a systematic methodology and may be used to future research on the subject. The analysis demonstrates that Big Data implementations in Smart Farming have a far wider impact than just resource extraction, having an impact on the whole food system. Big data are being utilized to restructure corporate systems for league season pricing models, drive satisfactory production choices, and give advanced analytics into agriculture production. Therefore, according to some experts, the present relationships of participants in the supply chain for food will see significant changes in the positions and dynamics between them. The partner picture shows an intriguing interplay of large tech corporations, VCs, and often tiny continue and challengers. Most government agencies simultaneously disclose open data with the need that privacy information be protected. Two distinct possibilities might play out in the development of smart agriculture: 1) Restricted, patent solutions where the farmer is a member of a fully interconnected food chain, or 2) open, communal systems where every participant in the chain network has the freedom to choose their own business relationships, both in terms of technical and crop supply. In the debate between these two possibilities, the continued growth of applications and data frameworks (portals and rules) and their administrative embedding will be of utmost importance.

State-of-the-art research is revolutionizing the vision systems of the smart city, which converts the visual signals from sensory input into feature representations and conveys the compact feature for analysis by using the computational resources of both front and back ends. To deploy a robust model, large amounts of labeled data are usually required, and thereby heavy computational and communication resources are incurred in model training as well as inference. However, the computational resources in front-end devices are usually constrained, and heavy transmission burden is imposed when leveraging multiple models amongst different ends. In this work, we propose a novel collaborative computing approach for intelligent sensing and low-cost analysis, which reduces the requirement of labeled data and communication cost, and balances the computational load in model training and inference. By incorporating the adversarial learning mechanism into collaborative model training, knowledge of different domains can be better exploited. Moreover, the learned models are deployed for inference in a collaborative manner, in which part of model is placed in front-ends for extracting intermediate feature maps, and part of the model remains in back ends for inference with received feature maps.

Streaming allows for both volume and velocity characteristics of big data, and often, for variety as well. However, performing analytics at interactive rates is currently an open challenge in most big data applications. Cloud computing platforms provide practical support and leverage to solving some of the big data and visual analytics problems, especially when dealing with the volume and velocity characteristics of current data generation. In order to interact with streaming data patterns in an elastic cloud environment, we present a new elastic framework for big data visual analytics in the cloud, the Cloudet. The Cloudet is a self-adaptive cloud-based platform that treats both data and compute nodes as elastic objects. The main objective is to readily achieve the scalability and elasticity of cloud computing platforms in order to process large streaming data and adapt to potential interactions between data stream features. Our main contributions include a robust cloud-based framework, the Cloudet, which can flexibly process the streaming data and applications to illustrate the setup and operations of this framework. The framework includes a cloud profile manager that attempts to optimize the cloudet parameters in order to achieve expressivity, scalability, reliability, and the proper aggregation of the data streams into several density maps for the purpose of dynamic visualization of data features.",10.1109/ICCI-CC.2015.7259407,G.

Significance of hierarchical and partitioning based clustering in grouping aware data placement for data intensive applications,2017,-1,Outliers,0.11158743672315054,"Recent development and exponential growth in the field of IT generates large volume of data every day in a variety of domains such as Social networks, Health care, Government sectors etc. These data are voluminous, varied and ever increasing at an unprecedented pace which makes storage and computing a mammoth task. Generally the time taken to execute a query and return the results, increases exponentially as the amount of data increases leading to more waiting times on the user. This processing inability has led to the use of Hadoop to analyze and gain insights from the data. With its distributed processing capability, Hadoop is considered as an efficient solution for query processing but it has its own limitation when the data to be processed exhibit interest locality. Generally it is observed that the data required for any query execution follows grouping behavior wherein only a part of the Big-Data set is utilized more often. Since Hadoop default data placement strategy (HDDPS) does not consider such grouping behavior among the dataset, it does not perform efficiently resulting in lacunas such as decreased local map execution, increased query execution time etc. Hence in this paper we experiment the significance of two most promising Matrix clustering techniques viz. partitioning and hierarchical in grouping aware data placement for improved performance. Both clustering techniques are separately applied over the user history log to obtain independent data groupings. These data groupings are interpreted and validated to extract the optimal data grouping for improved parallel execution. The proposed strategy was tested in 15 node Hadoop cluster. The results show an improved performance for Big-Data sets in heterogeneous distributed environment. It improves the data locality by 25.75% and reduces query execution time by 28% compared to HDDPS. Also Hierarchical based Matrix clustering shows a marginal improved performance over Partitioning based methods for queries exhibiting interest localities.",10.1109/PARCOMPTECH.2017.8068331,S.

Zooming in and Out Our Society: Discovering Macro/Micro Events from Social Media,2018,-1,Outliers,0.1796603992239213,"Social event detection is regarded as an useful tool for understanding our society and more importantly for providing people with various smart city services. However, given a large number of social big data, it is hard to find out the meaningful patterns with traditional statistical analysis. The aim of this concept paper is to present how to generate spatiotemporal constraints for analyzing social data. Particularly, To discover the hidden social event, spatio-temporal constraint generation process consists of three methods, which are i) generating spatio-temporal focus (STF), ii) allocating social texts to the STF, and iii) discovering social events in each STF. The STF can be composed by clustering social texts which are topically and spatially associated. To make the STF dynamic and incremental, we use windows for allocating a social text to an adequate STF. Lastly, the hidden social events are discovered from the STF on the basis of keywords and temporal distribution of the social texts.

Homomorphic Encryption Approach for String Concatenation,2022,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.8027559170466241,"In a modern environment, a large amount of data is generated from various sources like healthcare, government, banking, and other different sectors. The traditional method for storing information is becoming challenging to handle big data. The solution to storing big data is to store data on third-party service providers. Data protection is the primary concern for storing and accessing data due to the emerging rate of data breaches and adversaries in personal data storage. Intruders manage to access sensitive data despite many efforts to protect sensitive data. Homomorphic encryption is a data protection approach in the cryptographic domain that can perform computations on cipher data without decrypting it. The computation outcome is encrypted; the output will be the same when decrypted as if the operations had been performed on the original plaintext data. This encryption method for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation permits the data to be encrypted and outsourced to cloud environments for further processing. This paper proposes string concatenation on encrypted data using the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm with cipher blockchain mode of operation.",10.1109/ICCCMLA56841.2022.9989264,S.

A Study on BNM-cBLSTM for Financial Sentiment Analysis in European Bond Markets Based on mpBC-ELMo,2022,-1,Outliers,0.10858698375313247,"Economic and fiscal policies devised by international organizations, governments, and central banks rely significantly on economic projections, particularly during times of economic instability such as the one we have recently seen with the COVID-19 virus spreading globally. However, the accuracy of economic forecasting and now casting models remains a challenge since modern economies are prone to multiple shocks that make forecasting and now casting activities extremely difficult, both in the short and medium range. The purpose of the paper is to identify the key aspects, which must be taken into account in big data sentiment analysis to solve the problem of forecasting and now casting tasks. The work has developed an mpBC-ELMo based BNM-cBLSTM for financial sentiment analysis in European Bond markets. The proposed framework is processed based on collection of big data that are formed into a corpus. Initially, the corpus data is subjected to preprocessing, which performs tokenization, Lemmatization, URL removal, punctuations removal, Dependency Parsing, Noun Phrases, Named Entity recognition, and Coreference Resolution in order to make the data healthier and to get a potential impact for analyzing the sentiments. Thereafter, the data is converted into a vector using mpBC-ELMo, which addresses the complex characteristics of the word as well as polarity and handles stock bond correlation invariant, behavioral biases. Finally, BNM-cBLSTM analyses the sentiments and provides an accurate as well as optimized improvisation. In comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that the work tends to deliver a precise sentiment analysis and avoids erroneous prediction rate.",10.1109/ICDACAI57211.2022.00032,Q.

Recently, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Office of Inspector General has been examining how postal operators and customers could benefit from the big data USPS has access to. In this talk we envision an Internet of Postal Things (IoPT) that embeds sensors and other data collection technologies into physical objects, infrastructures, and the surroundings in which people live and businesses operate. The declining cost of sensors, wireless data connectivity and storage opens up virtually unlimited opportunities to collect and process data from any device, infrastructure, machine and even human beings. The IoPT would transform the postal infrastructure (vehicles, mailboxes, machines, letter carriers etc.) and help the USPS bring data management to the next level. It would create new rich data sources that could help the Postal Service improve operational performance, customer service, create new products and services, and support more efficient decision-making processes. The IoPT could also have a positive effect on non-postal sectors. For example, the use of sensors on postal trucks to collect environmental data could benefit local governments.

Some influential computer scientists wondered, should there be thousands of colleges and universities around the country all are teaching the same course to a small group of students in their own universities, why we should not invite one brilliant professor to teach the material to whole the world at once via the Internet? There are a few people who even believe that there might be only ten universities remaining within next fifty years since on line courses might replace the traditional education approach. Would using MOOCs be a way to solve unbalanced distribution of education resource in China? After the MOOCs, the Massive Open Online Experiments (MOOE) and the Massive Open Online Research (MOOR) appeared in China.

In order for investors to invest with confidence and for countries to have more control over their virtual currencies, it is desirable to study Bitcoin in depth. To research Bitcoin deeply, this paper is devote to analyze what are the factors affecting the price of Bitcoin and research the approach to predicting Bitcoin’s price. First, the influce factors of Bitcoin are studied. It is found that the current factors affecting Bitcoin mainly include macro factors and Bitcoin itself. This study of factors may provide valuable information for investors to analyze the invest. Then, the classical Bitcoin prediction methods based on machine learning are reasearched. It mainly contains two kinds of methods, imprecise prediction and accurate prediction. These machine learning methods usually construct a neural network model based on the given dataset, and then use the neural network to predict the detailed price of Bitcoin. Although big data and machine learning can be used to predict the price trend of Bitcoin, it is not legal tender, and it is not guaranteed by the government. Bitcoin's large price fluctuations make it a risky investment. Therefore, it is suggested for investors to consider whether to invest in Bitcoin. Besides, there is a certain error or sudden world-class major events affect the prediction, so the prediction models can not provide certain information. For the government, if it wants to ensure the value of its virtual currency, it should control the circulation of currency, neither too much nor too little.",,S. Wu

A Gaussian Bayesian model to identify spatio-temporal causalities for air pollution based on urban big data,2016,-1,Outliers,0.130148241475904,"Identifying the causalities for air pollutants and answering questions, such as, where do Beijing's air pollutants come from, are crucial to inform government decision-making. In this paper, we identify the spatio-temporal (ST) causalities among air pollutants at different locations by mining the urban big data. This is challenging for two reasons: 1) since air pollutants can be generated locally or dispersed from the neighborhood, we need to discover the causes in the ST space from many candidate locations with time efficiency; 2) the cause-and-effect relations between air pollutants are further affected by confounding variables like meteorology. To tackle these problems, we propose a coupled Gaussian Bayesian model with two components: 1) a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN) to represent the cause-and-effect relations among air pollutants, with an entropy-based algorithm to efficiently locate the causes in the ST space; 2) a coupled model that combines cause-and-effect relations with meteorology to better learn the parameters while eliminating the impact of confounding.

In addition, we employed the vector autoregressive model to investigate the dynamic relationships between the changes in charging demand and various explanatory factors. The results suggest that the daily average charging demand in Hefei decreased by 78.3 % compared to the predicted value during the pandemic. Furthermore, according to the variance decomposition and impulse response function analysis, national confirmed COVID-19 cases play a dominant role in reducing charging demand. The number of daily hospitalizations and Migration Scale Index also have significant and robust effect on the decrease in charging demand. The Air Quality Index and Baidu Index are susceptible to external factors and do not have a direct impact on the change in charging demand. Findings support a better understanding of changes in travel behavior during the pandemic and provide policy makers with references to deal with similar events.",10.1109/EI252483.2021.9712936,K.

The impact of US carbon tariff policy on China's social welfare and industrial development under the background of economic globalization—Based on big data empirical research,2021,-1,Outliers,0.08168694323756816,"Regarding the tension of carbon tariff between the United States and China, I establish a sequential game model to derive a relationship between the carbon tariff rate, export quantity and the social welfare for the developed country and developing country. To quantify the impact of the carbon tariff, I adopt time series analysis to empirically test the China-US tariff-export effect. The Granger causality test shows that the increase in Chinese export quantity is the cause for the United States increase in tariff rate in the long run, but not the opposite way. The Co-integration Analysis and Error Correction Model also predict that the implementation of the carbon tariff is negatively correlated with Chinese social welfare in the short run dynamically, and it will severely decrease the revenue of carbon-intensive industries. Taking environmental influence into account, I advance my model to include stages for the developing country's government to provide a carbon subsidy and firms to innovate low-carbon emission technology. In this sequential game, I derive the condition for developing countries to impose a carbon tariff and the impact of carbon tariff on the environment. Since carbon tariffs may be avoided and ineffective in the long run, I also develop a model of both countries producing a carbon-intensive good together by combining their technology or labor, and Shapley value gives an optimal proportion of the production percentage for each country. For China, it is necessary to develop environmentally-friendly technology as soon as possible. As Stern Review and Nordhaus suggested, the tradable carbon market, carbon tax and industrial policy are all potential methods for the government to improve social welfare and decrease pollution. The role of the carbon tariff could be viewed as an incentive to force the developing countries to break their inertia. Then, in the long run, cooperation can be mutually beneficial for countries to get out of the prisoner dilemma and share their specialized factors of production.",10.1109/BDEIM55082.2021.00038,S.

A Novel Approach for Parallelized Clustering Model by Using Hadoop MapReduce Framework,2022,-1,Outliers,0.11017404368926266,"The current generation of cellular devices have plenty of processing power and storage, but they lag behind in terms of huge data storage and processing software. ""Big Data"" is referred to huge volumes of unstructured data generated by high-performance applications from scientific computers to social networks, e-government to medical information systems, and so on. According to recent big data study, the amount of data continues to grow at an exponential rate. A strong computing paradigm like Hadoop and Map-Reduce is required to process enormous amounts of data on computing clusters. The Map-Reduce framework is a programming technique that allows you to handle terabytes of data in a fraction of the time. Big data needs good scheduling in order to attain outstanding results. The Scheduling Technique is used to decrease hunger, enhance resource utilisation, and distribute work to available resources.For the Hadoop Map-Reduce model, various scheduling algorithm has been developed, which differs widely in design, behavior, and handling various issues. Existing resource allocation scheduling do not consider the weight of each job which leads to unbalanced performance among nodes. We focus on several issues of Hadoop Map reduce and introduce novel mechanism to handle and process the Big data. The proposed approach is divided into three phases such as implementation of optimized clustering scheme, improving the clustering scheme by implementation them in parallel manner and finally, incorporating machine learning and Fuzzy logic based intelligent techniques to adapt the big data changes to efficiently process the huge data.In first phase, we develop improved P-DBSCAN algorithm which uses Mapper and reducer programs in such a way so that input data points will get into the cluster formulation. The proposed approach consists of several stages such as data partitioning stage, local clustering stage, data merger stage and global cluster generation stage as final outcome. Moreover, two cluster optimization methods are included to improve the clustering performance. DBSCAN parallelization options are examined using the Spark platform built to maximize memory consumption and iterative processes. Single-node Spark and Spark cluster platforms have historically used distinct resource managers for DBSCAN optimization.In second stage, we adopt the concept of Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm and developed a novel clustering scheme to overcome the issues of DBSCAN. This scheme uses mapper and reducer entities. Mapper receives its copy of the input dataset. Labeling activities are carried out by the Mapper, such as finding the closest centroid to an individual data object. The reducer creates a new value for each centroid based on the items allocated to it in the current iteration of the algorithm. This is determined by evaluating the average of all of the data objects in each cluster. Later, K-Medoid method proposed utilizing medoids as the center of clusters since they can be influenced by outliers, although this is a disadvantage. It aims to reduce the cost between the cluster's non-medoids and its medoid.Finally, we focus on semantic relationship extraction between queries where we adopted neuro-fuzzy based hybrid technique and TF-IDF algorithm. In this thesis, we developed a hybrid approach by using Fuzzy logic and neural network to mine high fuzzy utility patterns. New fuzzy rules are defined based on 6 different criteria such as Query Time, Query Length, Query Expiry, Total Queries, CPU Usages, and Task activity. First of all, we perform the data pre-processing where several tasks are performed to filter the data, later, these queries are processed through the scheduler where fuzzy rule based is used and semantic relationship is established among queries. Based on the TF-IDF approach weight are computed from filtered data. The average runtime performance of these schemes is obtained as 167.5s, 137.5s, 51.25s, 37.5s, and 25s by using Apriori (M), HFUPM, Apriori, and EFUPM, Proposed Approach, respectively.",10.1109/ICWITE57052.2022.10176257,M.

Environmental Parameter Modelling for Thermal Rating Calculations of Power Cables in Urban Areas using Machine Learning and Big Data,2020,7,Topic_7_energy_power_data,0.43337779650334673,"Vienna, among other cities, has the aspirations of transforming into a smart city of tomorrow. To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed.

To identify the best vehicles, we first use a distributed ranking scheme CarRank, where the vehicle autonomously classifies itself as important with respect to urban users' interest. Then, we present a centralized recruitment scheme, exploiting game-theory for the service provider to fairly and optimally select the best vehicles under desired coverage, redundancy, and quality requirements. Comparative analysis after in-depth simulations using realistic mobility traces of 2986 vehicles shows that the set of vehicles selected using ROVERS yield better results compared to other selection approaches.",10.1109/TVT.2019.2910568,J.

Mostly, the focus has been given to optimizing the storage and processing of each workload alone, either geospatial or time dimensions. To close this gap, in this paper, we have designed a pyramid-like indexing scheme that we term as geoTSI (short for geo time series index) which twists two dimensionality reduction geospatial encoding methods (geohash and S2) sequentially with a time series index to efficiently enable such mixed workload scenarios. This method enables geospatial and time indexes to collaborate synergistically in an aim to reduce the time required for accessing the disk and retrieving the time series data that comprises the answer for the mixed workload query. We show how our indexing scheme can be efficiently exploited to run a hybrid geospatial proximity query on time series data.

How can Big Data Enhance Machine Learning Model Performance in Predicting Future Prices? The Case of the US Consumer Price Index,2025,-1,Outliers,0.08887872678867252,"The consumer price index (CPI) is known as a key macroeconomic indicator for assessing inflation, and accurate predictions of CPI changes over time are significant for a country's economic development. Here, we collected 100+ years (1913–2025) of CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) data (monthly percentage change in CPI value) from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. We employed multiple forecasting models known as SARIMAX, SARIMA rolling forecast, Holt-Winters (HW), Holt-Winters rolling forecast, Facebook prophet (FP), and Facebook prophet rolling forecast to predict historical, current, and future CPI value. Key findings indicated CPI fell by 27.4% (a one-time event in the last 100 years) during the Great Depression of 1929–1933. Also, both original HW and FP models performed best to accurately predict the seasonal variation in CPI numbers during 2014–2025. Finally, the CPI (seasonally adjusted) value would be around 0.467 (all-year high) in January and 0.422 in April 2025, dropping to an all-year low of (-0.005) in November 2025. As per HW forecast, this pattern (a trend in variation of CPI value) of dropping to the lowest CPI in November and reaching peak (highest) in January would be the same for future years (2025–2027). This significant drop in CPI value in November 2025 could have profound implications for economic policies and planning, as it suggests a potential seasonal deflationary trend.

In order to help the Washington State Government more effectively control the Vespa Mandarinia intrusion. We built a model to predict the intrusion trend of Vespa Mandarinia and analyse whether the reports submitted by the public are valid. On the basis of the linear correlation coefficient of time and propagation distance, we used particle swarm optimization algorithm to get the initial position of invasion. Since the accuracy of the eyewitness reports provided by the public was uneven, we adopted a comprehensive evaluation model of score, and used three variates, including Distance score, Text score and Image score, to evaluate the credibility of eyewitness reports. Prioritizing major eyewitness reports was finally determined. Finally, the optimal time interval for updating the evaluation model is determined by calculating the linear correlation coefficient. As a result, we have a mathematical model that can effectively simulate biological invasions of Vespa Mandarinia and determine whether eyewitness reports are credible.

By applying the mixed strategy and evolutionary strategy the essay makes the conclusion of game will turn to an equilibrium that there is no financial fraud with strict supervision. Some recommendations are also given. First of all, the country should improve the law to protect the shareholders of listed companies. Secondly, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) should increase the punishment to the companies that make fake products. The possibility of fraud can be reduced only when the amount of punishment a company receives after fraud is greater than the profit of fraud. In addition, the CSRC should improve the system of broker market. If a public company falsifies its accounting, its brokers should be denied the right to work for another company or to start a company again and go public. Finally, the state should improve the independence of board department. For the accounting department, since the scale of accounting companies on the market is small and they need long-term financial support from customers, the company may threaten to cancel long-term cooperation or make accounting fraud by bribery.

The Application of Innovation and Catapult Research Techniques to Future Smart Cities Assessment Framework,2018,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.2988555259168897,"For the past few years, the concept of urban sustainability and smart city has been viewed as a crucial way to solve the problem regarding urbanization, and the global city thus ranks it as a future development goal. With the implementation of the above strategies, the construction of relevant city assessment tools is essential. However, the assessment framework of urban sustainability focuses on the aspect of environment and society, while smart city puts emphasis on economic and social indicators. Therefore, integrating the two concepts as “Smart Sustainable City” and constructing a related evaluation model would be more comprehensive. Moreover, the development of “Big Data” theory allows city planners to interpret and apply large amounts of data collected from various sources. Under this opportunity, the result of analyzing the actual big data to forecast the variance ratio of each indicator can be used as the objective basis to construct the model, which can increase the accuracy of the city assessment. Based on the big data analysis, this paper will construct an assessment framework of smart sustainable city in line with the future situation, and further conduct the model validation through city evaluation. First, this paper reviews the concepts and assessment framework of sustainable development and smart city in order to sum up the appropriate indicators to construct the model, and applies “Fuzzy Delphi Technique (FDT)” to select the indicators which are considered important regarding the smart sustainable city. In addition, “Data Mining” and “Analytic Network Process (ANP)” are used to predict the future variance ratio of smart sustainable city indicators and to apply the variance ratio regarding the future scenario to determine their weights. Finally, this paper will conduct an empirical analysis by assessing the smart sustainable level of cities, hoping to validate the model and propose related suggestions to promote the idea exchange of urban development.",10.1109/ICSSE.2018.8520043,W. -M.

Newly-Coined Words and Emoticon Polarity for Social Emotional Opinion Decision,2019,3,Topic_3_social_media_social media,1.0,"Nowadays, based-on mobile devices and internet, social network services(SNS) are common trends to everyone. Thus, decision of social and public opinions, and polarity about social happenings, political issues, government policies and decision, or commercial products is very important to the government, company, and a person. But, SNS are basically making newly-coined words and emoticons. Especially, emoticons are made by a person or companies. Newly-coined words are mostly made by communities. The SNS big data mainly consists of his kinds of newly-coined words and emoticons so that newly-coined words and emoticons analysis are very important to understand the social and public opinions, and polarity about social happenings, political issues, government policies and decision, or commercial products. Social big data is unstructured data and contains many newly-coined words and various emoticons. Therefore, there is a limitation to guarantee the accuracy and analysis range of social data of emotional analysis. The newly-coined words contains the social phenomena and trends of modern society implicitly. And the emoticons are electronic quasi-languages made up of letters and symbols, and express the emotional state more implicitly. Although the newly-coined words and emoticons are an important part of the emotional analysis, they are excluded from the emotional dictionary and analysis. In this research, newly-coined words and emoticons extracted from the raw twit messages include polarity and weight with pre-built dictionary. The polarity and weight would be calculated for emotional classification. The proposed emotional classification equation adds up the weights among the same polarity(positive or negative) and sums the negative weight value with the positive weight values. The polarity summation result is recorded in the variable. If the polarity summation result is more than threshold value, the twit message is decided as positive. If it is less than threshold value, it is decided as negative and the other values are decided as neutral. The accuracy of social big data analysis is improved by quantifying and analyzing emoticons and new-coined words.",10.1109/INFOCT.2019.8711413,J. S. Yang; K. S. Chung

TimeADF: A Predictive Method for Cross-Level Governmental Data Fusion,2025,-1,Outliers,0.2674811450830836,"At present, the government service platform of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has key problems such as difficult business collaboration, cross-level, cross-field and cross-departmental information transmission, and processing and storage of multi-source heterogeneous information data. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a construction scheme of the smart government affairs big data platform based on the Adaptive Decomposition and Filtering Framework (TimeADF). TimeADF solves the problems of high-frequency detail capture and long-term trend prediction of multi-source heterogeneous data through a three-stage design of reversible feature Reconstruction (RevIN), Frequency decomposition module (FDB), and high-frequency selector (ChooseK). Specifically, first normalize the multi-scale data using RevIN to ensure the integrity of cross-scale information; Then, through the Fourier transform, the low-frequency and medium-frequency components are separated by the FDB module, and the high-frequency components are calculated by the residuals, thereby dynamically screening the low-frequency policy cycle and high-frequency emergencies. The first k hidden high-frequency signals are extracted by the ChooseK module, and the hidden high-frequency information in the medium and low-frequency components is extracted for the second time. Because high-frequency information is more likely to predict the trends of certain government data in the future and enhance the sensitivity of prediction. Therefore, after superimposing the two high-frequency components and inputting them into FFN, the predictive output is achieved, accurately capturing the high-frequency details and long-term trends of government data. We conducted model checking on six datasets related to electricity, weather, financial transactions, etc. The prediction lengths covered {96, 192, 336, 720}. The results showed that TimeADF increased by an average of 39.8% and 24.7% respectively on MSE and MAE. It is significantly superior to prediction models such as MICN, DLinear, and Transformer.",10.1109/ICIMCT.2025.00015,X. Bi; Z. Yan; J. Zhu; E. Zuo

Relative Patterns Discovery toward Big Data Analytics,2015,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.6638921625825751,"Recently, enterprises and governments invested aggressively in big data analytics because it is truly representative of popular opinion based on millions of people. Despite bringing new opportunities, big data encounters the challenges such as extremely large number of observations (e.g., Millions of transactions), high dimensionality (e.g., Thousands of items), and immediate response. Taking big data into consideration, the conventional association analysis is frustrated by the extraction of patterns information. Specifically, the computational complexity of frequent item sets mining increases exponentially by the number of items, which has been proven to be an NP-Complete problem. Although many studies used a pruning-patterns strategy to reduce the complexity, it probably distorts the shape of data and incurs inaccurate result. In this paper, we introduce relative patterns discovery (named RPD) that explores the same patterns between each two observations. To show that RPD is a pragmatic solution toward big data analytics, we design a scalable outlier detection method (named SOD) based on the concept of RPD. Particularly, SOD can score the anomaly without enumerate all the relative patterns. The empirical investigations, conducted with various real-world datasets, demonstrate that SOD performs well even in the environment of large number of observations and high dimensionality.",10.1109/ICEBE.2015.74,H. -T.

Hotspots Analysis Using Cyber-Physical-Social System for a Smart City,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Internet of things plays a vital role in providing various services to users. Significant volumes of data are generated from the communication between a large numbers of heterogeneous devices over the Internet. Big data technology is generally used to handle the large volume of data. Complex networks are graphs (networks) having non-trivial topological features, such as random graphs and lattices. Big data of complex networks concerns big data methods that can be used to analyze massive structural data sets, including considerably large networks and sets of graphs. This study is based on the critical phenomenon arising in complex networks that enable us to analytically predict the hotspots in smart cities. Hotspots are places with significantly high communication traffic relative to others. In this study, we propose a cyber-physical-social system for the analysis of high communication traffic hotspots using telecom data. The proposed model constructs a graph, and perform social network analysis on it. The process of hotspot extraction is performed, followed by social network analysis, which is conducted by quantifying the importance of each hotspot based on network metrics. These metrics aid in determining the importance of each hotspot in a telecom data network. Our objective is to prioritize different areas and detect hotspots quickly. Our results indicate that the proposed model has an efficiency comparable with that of state of the art methods.

These problems faced by cities and countries are tried to be solved in the concept of smart cities and intelligent transportation by using information and communication technologies in line with the needs. While designing intelligent transportation systems (ITS), beyond traditional methods, big data should be designed in a state-of-the-art and appropriate way with the help of methods such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. In this study, a data-driven decision support system model was established to help the business make strategic decisions with the help of intelligent transportation data and to contribute to the elimination of public transportation problems in the city.

Firework: Big Data Sharing and Processing in Collaborative Edge Environment,2016,-1,Outliers,0.289954562799726,"Cloud computing, arguably, has become the de facto computing platform for the big data processing by researchers and practitioners for the last decade, and enabled different stakeholders to discover valuable information from large scale data. At the same time, in the decade, we have witnessed the fast growing deployment of billions of sensors and actuators in multiple applications domains, such as transportation, manufacturing, connected/wearable health care, smart city and so on, stimulating the emerging of Edge Computing (a.k.a., fog computing, cloudlet). However, data, as the core of both cloud computing and edge computing, is still owned by each stakeholder and rarely shared due to privacy concern and formidable cost of data transportation, which significantly limits Internet of Things (IoT) applications that need data input from multiple stakeholders (e.g., video analytics collects data from cameras owned by police department, transportation department, retailer stores, etc.). In this paper, we envision that in the era of IoT the demand of distributed big data sharing and processing applications will dramatically increase since the data producing and consuming are pushed to the edge of the network. Data processing in collaborative edge environment needs to fuse data owned by multiple stakeholders, while keeping the computation within stakeholders' data facilities. To attack this challenge, we propose a new computing paradigm, Firework, which is designed for big data processing in collaborative edge environment (CEE). Firework fuses geographically distributed data by creating virtual shared data views that are exposed to end users via predefined interfaces by data owners. The interfaces are provided in the form of a set of datasets and a set of functions, where the functions are privacy preserved and bound to the datasets. Firework targets to share data while ensuring data privacy and integrity for stakeholders. By pushing the data processing as close as to data sources, Firework also aims to avoid data movement from the edge of the network to the cloud and improve the response latency.",10.1109/HotWeb.2016.12,Q.

Analysis of Subway Passenger Flow for a Smarter City: Knowledge Extraction From Seoul Metro’s ‘Untraceable’ Big Data,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Timely and efficient analysis of big data collected from various gateways installed in a smart city is an intractable problem and requires immediate priority. Given the stochastic and massive nature of big data, the existing literature often relies on artificial intelligence techniques based on information theory. As a new approach, this paper presents a knowledge extraction method based on an analysis of Seoul Metro's 'untraceable' ridership big data. Without identification information, the untraceable ridership data only shows the hourly accumulation of station entry and exit information. To reconstruct the missing information in the data set, this study proposes a fluid dynamics model and adopts a heuristic genetic algorithm based on optimization theory as the problem solver. The result of our model presents the distribution of the elapsed time defined on an hourly basis taken until a passenger returns to the station they departed from. To validate our model, we acquired subway ridership data with passengers' identification with permission from Seoul Metro. This paper presents two novel aspects of subway ridership, namely the dependency on departure time and the discrepancy between weekend and weekday traffic. Our analytical approach contributes to solving the problem of extracting hidden knowledge from big collection of data missing critical information, e.g., constantly and autonomously gathered data fragments from numerous gateways in smart cities.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985734,H.

Distributed sensor data computing in smart city applications,2017,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.6487429915228375,"With technologies developed in the Internet of Things, embedded devices can be built into every fabric of urban environments and connected to each other; and data continuously produced by these devices can be processed, integrated at different levels, and made available in standard formats through open services. The data, obviously f a form of `big data', is now seen as the most valuable asset in developing intelligent applications. As the sizes of the IoT data continue to grow, it becomes inefficient to transfer all the raw data to a centralised, cloud-based data centre and to perform efficient analytics even with the state-of-the-art big data processing technologies. To address the problem, this article demonstrates the idea of ""distributed intelligence"" for sensor data computing, which disperses intelligent computation to the much smaller while autonomous units, e.g., sensor network gateways, smart phones or edge clouds in order to reduce data sizes and to provide high quality data for data centres. As these autonomous units are usually in close proximity to data consumers, they also provide potential for reduced latency and improved quality of services.

As the implementation of the Master Plan for the Construction of Hainan Free Trade Port, many ocean-going ships and shipping companies choose to register in Hainan, resulting in a significant increase in the demand for ship-related talents. For a long time, China has implemented strict registration system for ships, which only registration of vessels owned by local residents or companies are allowed. As a result, more than 2000 units of Chinese-funded international sailing ships choose to register in countries allowing open registration and fly flags of convenience for easier registration and taxes preference. On June 1, 2020, the Chinese government released the Master Plan for the Construction of Hainan Free Trade Port, putting forward to building more liberal shipping system in Hainan, China. Hainan Free Trade Port International Ship Registry Center has been established in order to facilitate ocean-going ships to register in Hainan with ""Yangpu, China"" as the registry port, and to attract Chinese-funded vessels under flags of convenience or foreign-funded vessels to register in Hainan.This paper uses descriptive analysis with the big data worldwide of commercial ships of 1000 GT and above released by United Nations Committee on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 2019 to find out the general condition of Chinese-funded vessels in order to make a prediction of shipping talents demand in Hainan Free Trade Port.The descriptive analysis of big data is the analysis of various characteristics of a set of data in order to describe the characteristics of the measurement sample and the overall characteristics it represents, and to reveal the characteristics with charts, curves and other visual methods, provide advice and reference to user when making decision.The descriptive big data analysis shows that there are 34.91% of Chinese-funded ocean-going ships flying the flag of convenience, while the tonnage of those vessels accounts for 55.9% in 2019. The result reveals that a large number of Chinese-funded ships are sailing under the flag of convenience. The state promptly formulated the ""master plan"" including to establish international registration system so as to attract Chinese-funded ships to return and register in Hainan. In fact, the latest statistic shows the trend of returning of those Chinese-funded ship is obvious since the implementation of the plan. As a result, the free trade port needs a large number of shipping talents, including seafarers, shore-based management personnel, and other ship-related professionals. However, the cultivation scale of ship-related talents in Hainan cannot meet the huge demand for shipping talents caused by increasing registration of international trading ships and companies.This paper proposed a demand-orientated cultivation mode for shipping talents in higher vocational education in the view of serving the development of local economy under the background of Hainan Free Trade Port.",10.1109/ICISE-IE53922.2021.00232,H.

Cutting the Unnecessary Long Tail: Cost-Effective Big Data Clustering in the Cloud,2022,-1,Outliers,0.17328278083688273,"Clustering big data often requires tremendous computational resources where cloud computing is undoubtedly one of the promising solutions. However, the computation cost in the cloud can be unexpectedly high if it cannot be managed properly. The long tail phenomenon has been observed widely in the big data clustering area, which indicates that the majority of time is often consumed in the middle to late stages in the clustering process. In this research, we try to cut the unnecessary long tail in the clustering process to achieve a sufficiently satisfactory accuracy at the lowest possible computation cost. A novel approach is proposed to achieve cost-effective big data clustering in the cloud. By training the regression model with the sampling data, we can make widely used k-means and EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithms stop automatically at an early point when the desired accuracy is obtained. Experiments are conducted on four popular data sets and the results demonstrate that both k-means and EM algorithms can achieve high cost-effectiveness in the cloud with our proposed approach. For example, in the case studies with the much more efficient k-means algorithm, we find that achieving a 99 percent accuracy needs only 47.71-71.14 percent of the computation cost required for achieving a 100 percent accuracy while the less efficient EM algorithm needs 16.69-32.04 percent of the computation cost. To put that into perspective, in the United States land use classification example, our approach can save up to $94,687.49 for the government in each use.",10.1109/TCC.2019.2947678,D. Li; S. Wang; N.

Traffic congestion, pollutant emissions, energy consumption are some of the problems related to urban mobility. Therefore, there is the need of tools able to support decision-makers in studying, evaluating, and planning sustainable urban evolutions. A few open-source and proprietary solutions are available requiring on-premises installations, large effort, and providing limited capabilities to actually handle real-time data (from data spaces, and standards). Moreover, they are limited in terms of analytic integration and do not offer automatic generation of suggestions. In practice they do not manage the explosion of complexity regarding computational and storage/models aspects. For these reasons, this paper presents a comprehensive architecture for a Smart City Digital Twin platform, specifically designed to support mobility and transportation decision-making through advanced what-if analysis and optimization. The platform, integrated within the Snap4City system, enables real-time data processing and complex analytics to create virtual urban environments for evaluating potential infrastructure changes.

An Unlicensed Taxi Identification Model Based on Big Data Analysis,2016,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Social networks and mobile networks are exposing human beings to a big data era. With the support of big data analytics, conventional intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are gradually changing into data-driven ITS (D2 ITS). Along with traffic growth, D2ITS need to solve more real-life problems, including the issue of unlicensed taxis and their identification, which potentially disrupts the taxi business sector and endangers society safety. As a remedy to this issue, a smart model is proposed in this paper to identify unlicensed taxis. The proposed model consists of two submodel components, namely, candidate selection model and candidate refined model. The former is used to screen out a coarse-grained suspected unlicensed taxi candidate list. The list is taken as an input for the candidate refined model, which is based on machine learning to get a fine-grained list of suspected unlicensed taxis. The proposed model is evaluated using real-life data, and the obtained results are encouraging, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in identifying unlicensed taxis, helping governments to better regulate the traffic operation and reduce associated costs.",10.1109/TITS.2015.2498180,W.

A Novel Big-Data-Driven Credit Reporting Framework for SMEs in China,2016,-1,Outliers,0.14325710920693618,"SMEs (Small and Medium-size Enterprises) in China always face financing constraints and hardly obtain bank loans under unsound financing system. In external f Academic literature has shown that widespread information asymmetry may prevent the efficient allocation of lending, leading to credit rationing. Currently, most credit reporting, models for SMEs in China are primarily based on hard information about the enterprises and their owners but lack comprehensive evaluation based on the combination with soft information. To bridge the gap for SMEs, we propose a novel big-data-driven credit reporting framework which presents a new credit reporting system by including big data in business, finance, and social networks. The proposed approach features in capturing diversified data online, conducting evaluation and analysis in real-time, and automatically generating online credit reports for SMEs, banks, and government.

Efficient Dictionary Compression for Processing RDF Big Data Using Google BigQuery,2016,-1,Outliers,0.15795064022562524,"The Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model, is used on the Web to express billions of structured statements in a wide range of topics, including government, publications, life sciences, etc. Consequently, processing and storing this data requires the provision of high specification systems, both in terms of storage and computational capabilities. On the other hand, cloud-based big data services such as Google BigQuery can be used to store and query this data without any upfront investment. Google BigQuery pricing is based on the size of the data being stored or queried, but given that RDF statements contain long Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), the cost of query and storage of RDF big data can increase rapidly. In this paper we present and evaluate a novel and efficient dictionary compression algorithm which is faster, generates small dictionaries that can fit in memory and results in better compression rate when compared with other large scale RDF dictionary compression. Consequently, our algorithm also reduces the BigQuery storage and query cost.",10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841775,O. Dawelbeit; R. McCrindle
Interregional Value-Added Tax in the Era of E-Commerce: Tax Policy Design Based on Big Data from Online Retailing,2024,-1,Outliers,0.08387805796032591,"The value-added tax (VAT) in China is levied and allocated based on the origin principle. Under the background of the increasing substitution of online retail for traditional offline retail, this mechanism will exacerbate the disparity of regional tax revenue, and intensify tax competition among local governments. Therefore, reconsidering the allocation mechanism of value-added tax in China can be an important policy decision, and it is influenced by various economic and social factors. Firstly, we utilize large-scale retail transaction data from an e-commerce platform to measure regional disparities in retail and consumption among different regions and then reveals present tax policy results in revenue imbalance in different regions. Secondly, we establish a model based on game theory to illustrate how the origin principle leads to fierce tax competition among regions. Furthermore, by establishing and solving tax allocation models between local governments and the central government, this study simulates and calculates the degree of revenue imbalance under different scenarios and attempts to propose policy measures. The results indicate that implementing the destination principle will reduce regional tax imbalances. Moreover, adjusting the allocation ratio between the central government and local governments based on city levels is advantageous for further reducing regional tax revenue disparities.",10.23919/JSC.2024.0006,Y.

Thanks to AI, companies make more accurate forecasts, more efficient production and logistics models, and, as a result, minimize stocks, waste, and excess production, reduce fuel consumption, and reduce harmful emissions. Big data (BD) and BDA technologies increase the quality of management decisions and contribute to improving the consistency and transparency of processes in complex supply chains. Despite the very good start, the implementation of AI and BD to achieve supply chain sustainability requires serious research. This implementation is still in its early stages of development and has faced several challenges.

Regulating Economic Law and Privacy through Big Data Technologies,2024,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"The economics of privacy examines the policy implications of the interaction between people's decisions to expose personal data and corporations' strategies for implementing innovation using this information. The law and policy program (D-DCRCLPP) of the data-to-decisions cooperative research center provides examples of the various ways that regulation affects the economy and, in turn, living standards. As a result, only a limited amount of capital, labor, and technology may be used in the production process. Regulation, when done incorrectly, has the potential to stifle innovation and learning while also limiting opportunities for everyone. Big Data technology (BDT) has been studied, with a focus on privacy and data protection techniques, which led to the formulation of this policy proposal based on privacy law (PL). Several perspectives are provided, each with benefits and weaknesses. These perspectives come from the domains of governance, law, economics, and information science. Enormous, linked, and information sharing are multifaceted ways that necessitate the use of a variety of technologies to promote and protect people's economic and political rights. Existing and emerging rules of international economic law have an indirect impact on such projects. New regulations for digital commerce are meant to ensure global data mobility. At the same time, international investment law will most likely be used to defend governments attempting to compel data sharing from private data holders. For these reasons, international economic law limits governments' ability to cope with asymmetric data ownership while promoting information holders' right to preserve control over data placement and utilization. Finally, recommendations are offered to foster a broader conversation, resulting in an overall performance of 96.7%.",10.1109/ICERCS63125.2024.10895428,A. D. Ali; B. Sofir; S. F. Sulaiman; N. K.

Integrating physical and social sensing to enable smart city mobility services,2016,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7105802603497949,"The Internet of Things (IoT) allows objects to be sensed and managed over distributed networks, which creates opportunities for more direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems. People-centric sensing or social sensing transforms how we sense the world. Today, social sensing, such as sensing via mobile apps, complements physical sensing (e.g., IoT) by substantially extending the horizon we know about the world in real time. This exploratory paper discusses how we can integrate physical and social sensing to enable better and smarter services.

Block-based realtime big-data processing for smart cities,2016,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Administrators and operators of next generation cities will likely be required to exhibit a good understanding of technical features, data issues, and complex information that, up to few years ago, were quite far from day-to-day administration tasks. In the smart city era, the increased attention to data harvested from the city fosters a more informed approach to city administration, requiring involved operators to drive, direct and orient technological processes in the city, more effectively. Such an increasing need, requires tools and platforms that can easily and effectively be controlled by non-technical people. In this paper, an approach for enabling “easier” composition of real-time data processing pipelines in smart-cities is presented, exploiting a block-based design approach, similar to the one adopted in the Scratch programming language for elementary school students.

To provide best user experience of such service, three primary factors including waiting time, travel time, and supply of AVs are taken into consideration to for multi-objective optimization facilitated in three steps. With the queueing network model and traffic flow analysis, optimal operation of service could be achieved with minimum average travel time. The optimal number of available AVs could be identified while guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. To manage the supply and demand of the service in each geographical area, bipartite graph matching is adopted to accomplish optimal resource allocation. It is further shown that the optimization of operation of autonomous vehicle fleet can be successfully achieved, to outperform what human- driving vehicles can possibly do.

The model used in this study emulates seventeen consecutive intersections on a corridor. Signal controls and vehicle volumes at two of the intersections are driven by real-time data while the remaining intersections are driven by preset data.

Nei-TTE: Intelligent Traffic Time Estimation Based on Fine-Grained Time Derivation of Road Segments for Smart City,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.45228701202076604,"With the development of the Internet of Things and big data technology, the intelligent transportation system is becoming the main development direction of future transportation systems. The time required for a given trajectory in a transportation system can be accurately estimated using the trajectory data of the taxis in a city. This is a very challenging task. Although historical data have been used in existing research, excessive use of trajectory information in historical data or inaccurate neighbor trajectory information does not allow for a better prediction accuracy of the query trajectory. In this article, we propose a deep learning method based on neighbors for travel time estimation (TTE), called the Nei-TTE method. We divide the entire trajectory into multiple disjoint segments and use the historical trajectory data approximated at the time level. Our model captures the characteristics of each segment and utilizes the trajectory characteristics of adjacent segments as the road network topology and speed interact. We use velocity features to effectively represent adjacent segment structures. The experiments on the Porto dataset show that the experimental results of our model are significantly better than those of the existing models.",10.1109/TII.2019.2943906,J. Qiu; L. Du; D. Zhang; S.

Spatially Representative Online Big Data Sampling for Smart Cities,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.6169487386631841,"The diversity of sensing options that IoT offers imposed requirements to evolve stream processing engines so to cope with highly heterogeneous and fast-pace data streams challenging their computing capacities. Location intelligence applications aim at exploiting those geo-referenced data in generating visualizations and dashboards that provide deep insights for assisting decision making in smart cities and urban planning. As data arriving are mostly geo-referenced and the rate is fluctuating in pace and skewness, computations upon streams should depend on approximation by applying methods such as sampling. Representativeness in sampling designs remains the pivotal concern in the literature. In spatial data streams contexts, it loosely means selecting proportional counts of spatial tuples from each group of tuples that belong to the same real geometry (i.e., geographically residing in the same proximity) within each streaming time window. This is challenging in streaming settings because spatial data is parametrized, loosing hence it is real geometries, which requires costly geometric operations to project them back to maps. To close this void, we have designed SpatialSPE in a previous work and incorporated an efficient fine-grained spatial online sampling method (SAOS) transparently within its layers. In this paper, we extend SAOS (the novel method is termed ex-SAOS) by new features that allow efficient online spatial sampling on a coarser level, which is a requirement in smart city scenarios. Our results show that ex-SAOS is efficient and effectively extends SAOS for more general smart city and urban computing scenarios.",10.1109/CAMAD50429.2020.9209294,I. M. A. Jawarneh; P.

Mining Human Activity Patterns From Smart Home Big Data for Health Care Applications,2017,7,Topic_7_energy_power_data,0.2704020524942828,"Nowadays, there is an ever-increasing migration of people to urban areas. Health care service is one of the most challenging aspects that is greatly affected by the vast influx of people to city centers. Consequently, cities around the world are investing heavily in digital transformation in an effort to provide healthier ecosystems for people. In such a transformation, millions of homes are being equipped with smart devices (e.g., smart meters, sensors, and so on), which generate massive volumes of fine-grained and indexical data that can be analyzed to support smart city services. In this paper, we propose a model that utilizes smart home big data as a means of learning and discovering human activity patterns for health care applications. We propose the use of frequent pattern mining, cluster analysis, and prediction to measure and analyze energy usage changes sparked by occupants' behavior. Since people's habits are mostly identified by everyday routines, discovering these routines allows us to recognize anomalous activities that may indicate people's difficulties in taking care for themselves, such as not preparing food or not using a shower/bath. This paper addresses the need to analyze temporal energy consumption patterns at the appliance level, which is directly related to human activities. For the evaluation of the proposed mechanism, this paper uses the U.K. Domestic Appliance Level Electricity data set-time series data of power consumption collected from 2012 to 2015 with the time resolution of 6 s for five houses with 109 appliances from Southern England. The data from smart meters are recursively mined in the quantum/data slice of 24 h, and the results are maintained across successive mining exercises.

In this work, we consider the paradigm where cloud service providers collect big data from resource-constrained devices for building ML-based prediction models that are then sent back to be run locally on the intermittently connected resource-constrained devices. Our proposed solution comprises an intelligent polynomial-time heuristic that maximizes the level of trust of ML models by selecting and switching between a subset of the ML models from a superset of models in order to maximize the trustworthiness while respecting the given reconfiguration budget/rate and reducing the cloud communication overhead. We evaluate the performance of our proposed heuristic using two case studies. First, we consider Industrial IoT (IIoT) services, and as a proxy for this setting, we use the turbofan engine degradation simulation data set to predict the remaining useful life of an engine. Our results in this setting show that the trust level of the selected models is 0.49%-3.17% less compared to the results obtained using integer linear programming (ILP). Second, we consider smart cities services, and as a proxy of this setting, we use an experimental transportation data set to predict the number of cars. Our results show that the selected model's trust level is 0.7%-2.53% less compared to the results obtained using ILP.

To effectively organize data in smart cities, managing all data lifecycle stages, from creation to consumption, is essential, emphasizing the critical role of information and communications technology (ICT) and information technology (IT) in resource and data management. Sustainable technology focuses on designing, organizing, and managing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies within ICT and IT architectural solutions in smart cities, addressing management of data/databases, resources, network communication, cybersecurity issues, and software services development. This paper reviews various smart city ICT architectures, such as centralized, decentralized-to-centralized (DC2C-ICT), distributed-to-centralized (D2C-ICT), and hybrid-ICT architectures. This discussion comprehensively covers key concepts of big data-driven architecture, including various design perspectives, management, control, and monitoring systems, as well as a range of ICT/IoT technologies and techniques. It involves organizing city data within IoT networks, utilizing multiple computing nodes and platforms in edge-to-cloud orchestration. Emphasis is on the convergence and integration of ICT, IoT, and Big Data with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for efficient organization and management. The paper introduces an innovative big data-driven architecture for hierarchical multitier ICT management in smart city IoT networks, rooted in edge-to-cloud orchestration. This architecture can incorporate diverse ICT and IoT technologies across different multilayer ICT architectures over time, making it adaptable and suitable for various domains. Furthermore, it is well-equipped to manage ICT resources and address big data challenges, including the Vs challenges, for the Smart, Sustainable, Scalable, and Reliable development of cities.

A Survey on Quality Assurance Techniques for Big Data Applications,2017,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,1.0,"With the rapid advance of big data and cloud computing, building high quality big data systems in different application fields has gradually became a popular research topic in academia and industry as well as government agencies. However, more quality problems lead to application errors. Although the current research work has discussed how to ensure the quality of big data applications from several aspects, there is no systematic discussion on how to ensure the quality of large data applications. Therefore, a systematic study on big data application quality assurance is very necessary and critical. This paper focuses on the survey of quality assurance techniques of big data applications, and it introduces big data properties and quality attributes. It mainly discusses the key approaches to ensure the quality of big data applications and they are testing, model-driven architecture (MDA), monitoring, fault tolerance, verification and also prediction techniques.

Monitoring the citizens' perception on urban security in Smart City environments,2015,-1,Outliers,0.129192878013182,"Sensing the perception of citizens on urban security is a key point in Smart City management. To address non-emergency issues municipalities commonly acquire citizens' reports and then analyze them offline to perform targeted actions. However, since non-emergency data potentially scale towards Big Data there is a need for open standards and technologies to enable data mining and Business Intelligence analyses. The paper presents an integrated data mining and Business Intelligence architecture, relying on open technologies, for the analysis of non-emergency open data acquired in a Smart City context. Non-emergency data are first enriched with additional information related to the context of the warning reports and then analyzed offline to generate (i) informative dashboards based on a selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and (iii) association rules representing implications between warning categories and contextual information (e.g., city areas, districts, time slots). KPIs and rules are exploited to selectively notify to municipality actors (assessors, area operators) potentially critical situations, according to their role and authority.

Health Monitoring and Diagnosis for Geo-Distributed Edge Ecosystem in Smart City,2023,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.4369377146546985,"With the increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices being deployed and used in daily life, the load on computational devices has grown exponentially. This situation is more prevalent in smart cities where such devices are used for autonomous control and monitoring. Smart cities have different kinds of applications that are aided through IoT devices that collect data, send it to computational processing and storage devices, and get back decisions or actuate the actions based on the input data. There has been a stringent requirement to reduce the end-to-end delay in this process owing to the remote deployment of cloud data centres. This eventually led to the revolution of edge computing, wherein nano–micro-processing devices can be deployed closer to the premises of the smart application and process the data generated with a lower turnaround time. However, due to the limited computational power and storage, controlling the workload diverted to the edge devices has been challenging. The workload scheduling policies and task allocation schemes often fail to consider the run time health of the edge devices due to a lack of proper monitoring infrastructure. Thus, in this article, we proposed a health monitoring and diagnosis framework for geo-distributed edge clusters processing big data generated by smart city applications. This framework is built over the Map-Reduce approach for distributed processing of big data on edge clusters deployed across the smart city. Within this framework, SmartMonit (a monitoring agent) is deployed that collects the health statistics of edge devices and predicts the potential failures using an artificial neural network-based self-organising maps approach. The proposed framework is deployed over different clusters to test the efficacy concerning failure detection.",10.1109/JIOT.2023.3247640,W. Wen; U. Demirbaga; A. Singh; A. Jindal; R. S. Batth; P.

The smart city and mobility: The functional polarization of urban flow,2017,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.24783800329668804,"The paper deals with the definition of urban mobility, assuming that inside the city, the flow of mobility is deeply connected with the distribution, quality and use of the urban activities that “polarize” different users (residents, commuters, tourists and city users). In this vision, ICT assume a strategic role, but the need to reconsider their role emerges in respect to the concept of a smart city. The consideration that “urban smartness” does not depend exclusively on the ICT component or on the quantitative presence of technologies in the city, in fact, represents a shared opinion within the current scientific debate on the subject of the smart city. The paper assumes that, for the present urban contexts, the smart vision has to be related to an integrated approach, which considers the city as a complex system. Inside the urban system, the networks for both material and immaterial mobility interact with the urban activities that play a supporting role and have characteristics that affect the levels of urban smartness. Changes in urban systems greatly depend on the sorts of innovation technology that have intensely modified the social component to a far greater extent than others. Big Data, for instance, can help with knowledge of urban processes, provided they have to be well-interpreted and managed, and this will be of interest within the interactions among urban systems and the functioning of the system as a whole. Town planning has to take on responsibility in regard to approaching cities according to a different vision and updating its tools in order to steer the urban system steadfastly into a smartness state. In a systemic vision, this transition must be framed within the context of a process of governmental transformation that is carefully oriented towards the individuation of interactions among the different subsystems composing the city. According to this vision, the study of urban mobility can be related to the attractiveness generated by the different urban functions. The formalization of the degree of polarization, activated by urban functions, represents the main objective of this study. Among the urban functions, the study considers tourism as one of the most significant in the formalization of urban mobility flow inside the smart city.",10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005730,R. Fistola; M.

Smart City Data Modelling using Semantic Web Technologies,2021,-1,Outliers,0.14805722184969827,"In modern Smart City ecosystems, the wave of Big data has offered the potential for cities to obtain actionable insights from a large amount of data, collected from heterogeneous sources. To cope with data variety and to support querying facilities and navigation, domain experts, who possess the knowledge required to understand data sources structure and content, resort to the definition of metadata layers, for reconciling terminological differences and resolving ambiguity of data sources attributes. To this aim, the adoption of Semantic Web technologies assures a unified view of heterogeneous data sources and improves data access, leveraging open standards for knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose an approach to create a semantic data layer over Smart City data sources. The approach is grounded on two main pillars: (i) a procedure, to build and manage the semantic layer; (ii) a tool, implementing the steps of the procedure, devoted to support domain experts. Results of an experimentation conducted on representative Smart City data sources demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach. In particular, the presence in our approach of a preliminary step regarding lexical enrichment of data source attributes helped increasing the retrieval of useful concepts from domain ontologies for attribute annotation. In addition, allowing domain experts to provide additional ontological knowledge by specialising or creating new concepts and semantic relationships fostered flexibility in the annotation procedure, facilitating the evolution of the semantic layer. Finally, the developed semi-automatic tool helped domain experts in the semantic annotation process by also providing validation support.",10.1109/ISC253183.2021.9562913,D. Bianchini; V.

Fast Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent for Big Data Classification,2021,-1,Outliers,0.12493725467129095,"Large-scale classification is an important task of machine learning, especially in the smart city field, which is a big data environment. In recent years, single-threaded optimization algorithms can no longer meet the needs of big data applications. When a single machine is trained, it will face the problem of insufficient memory and limited computing capacity. Therefore, distributed algorithms have been proposed to solve big data classification, and have received much attention. Particularly, distributed gradient descent (GD) is a widely-used algorithm for solving big data problem. However, distributed algorithms based on GD always converge slowly and suffer from expensive time in the training process. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel fast distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm for big data classification in this paper. By formulating the original optimization problem as a series of subproblems for classification in each machine. In particular, we exploit a fast stochastic method combined with the Nesterov acceleration method for sub-problem optimization in parallel to improve the convergence speed, and thus reduce the training time. The experimental results on some public and benchmark data sets show that our proposed distributed algorithm can converge faster with the competitive accuracy performance compared with distributed GD-based methods, which is suitable to big data classification.",10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00251,M.

AttractRank: District Attraction Ranking Analysis Based on Taxi Big Data,2021,-1,Outliers,0.26265528208377803,"The city's district attraction ranking plays an essential role in the city's government because it can be used to reveal the city's district attraction and, thus, help government make decisions for urban planning in terms of the smart city. The traditional methods for urban planning mainly rely on the district's GDP, employment rate, population density, information from questionnaire surveys, and so on. However, as a comparison, such information is becoming relatively less informative as the explosion of an increasing amount of urban data. What is more, there is a serious shortcoming in these methods, i.e., they are independent representations of the attraction of a district and do not take into account the interaction among districts. With the development of urban computing, it is possible to make good use of urban data for urban planning. To this end, based on taxi big data obtained from Guangzhou, China, this article proposes a district attraction ranking approach called AttractRank, which for the first time uses taxi big data for district ranking. An application system is developed for demonstration purposes. First, the entire Guangzhou city is divided into a number of districts by using constrained K-means. Second, the original PageRank algorithm is extended to integrate with the taxi's origin–destination ($OD$) points to establish the $OD$ matrix, whereby the attraction ranking of each district can be calculated. Finally, by visualizing the results and case studies obtained from AttractRank, we can successfully obtain the pattern of how attractions of districts change over time and interesting discoveries on urban lives; therefore, it has wide applications in urban planning and urban data mining.",10.1109/TII.2020.2994038,G.

LLMQUA:Using LLM Automation to Enhance Risk Quantification in Data Processing for Big Data Platforms,2025,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.20451882314877146,"The compliant use of data has become an issue of significant concern for governments worldwide in the era of big data. Big data platforms span numerous fields, including education, government services, and e-commerce. Ensuring data compliance across these sectors has drawn considerable attention from both governmental and enterprise managers. To address this, relevant enterprises and scholars have developed numerous standards tailored specifically to various industry sectors. Thus, differentiating their similarities and differences demands extensive experience in platform development and in-depth knowledge of these standards. This implicitly elevates the difficulty and entry barrier for compliance detection in big data platform usage. The current standard compliance checks mainly rely on manual inspections, typically taking anywhere from one week to three months to complete. Recently, Zhan et al. proposed two automated methods enabling risk quantification for big data platforms based on standard documents. However, these approaches still have not resolved the automation of transforming standards into usable templates for these systems. In practice, developing such templates from standards requires experienced developers and typically takes from three days to one week, significantly restricting platform scalability. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their powerful text parsing capabilities have drawn extensive attention from researchers.

Evaluation of High Density GPUs as Sustainable Smart City Infrastructure,2015,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7212474323386876,"Internet of things (IoT) is driving the big data revolution in smart cities. In order to make informed, accurate and real-time decisions, smart cities have to invest in powerful computing infrastructure with the minimal total cost of ownership. Smart city infrastructure will need to process data from various scientific and engineering domains like weather variability, traffic management, disease control etc in real-time while keeping the operational costs to minimum. In this paper we build a case for using General Purpose GPUs (GPGPU) as an alternate to the traditional CPU based computing. Utilising the GPUs in development of smart city infrastructure is an attractive alternate as it provides an efficient computing capacity when compared with traditional CPU only solutions. However, we find that naive deployment of applications on high-density GPUs results in lower scalability and performance.

Dynamic Network Model for Smart City Data-Loss Resilience Case Study: City-to-City Network for Crime Analytics,2017,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.43872561367239354,"Today's cities generate tremendous amounts of data, thanks to a boom in affordable smart devices and sensors. The resulting big data creates opportunities to develop diverse sets of context-aware services and systems, ensuring smart city services are optimized to the dynamic city environment. Critical resources in these smart cities will be more rapidly deployed to regions in need, and those regions predicted to have an imminent or prospective need. For example, crime data analytics may be used to optimize the distribution of police, medical, and emergency services. However, as smart city services become dependent on data, they also become susceptible to disruptions in data streams, such as data loss due to signal quality reduction or due to power loss during data collection. This paper presents a dynamic network model for improving service resilience to data loss. The network model identifies statistically significant shared temporal trends across multivariate spatiotemporal data streams and utilizes these trends to improve data prediction performance in the case of data loss. Dynamics also allow the system to respond to changes in the data streams such as the loss or addition of new information flows. The network model is demonstrated by city-based crime rates reported in Montgomery County, MD, USA. A resilient network is developed utilizing shared temporal trends between cities to provide improved crime rate prediction and robustness to data loss, compared with the use of single city-based auto-regression. A maximum improvement in performance of 7.8 % for Silver Spring is found and an average improvement of 5.6 % among cities with high crime rates. The model also correctly identifies all the optimal network connections, according to prediction error minimization. City-to-city distance is designated as a predictor of shared temporal trends in crime and weather is shown to be a strong predictor of crime in Montgomery County.",10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2757841,O.

Meanwhile, with the emerge of big data processing frameworks, such as Hadoop and Tensor-flow, more and more mobile users are embracing big data analytics by issuing queries to analyze their data. In this paper, we investigate the problem of Quality-of-Service (QoS) aware query evaluation for big data analytics in a mobile edge cloud to maximize the system throughput while minimizing the query evaluation time of each admitted query, by exploring the materialization of intermediate query results. We consider dynamic big-data query evaluations where user queries arrive one by one without the knowledge of future arrivals, and the system needs to respond to each query by accepting or rejecting the query immediately. We propose an online algorithm for query admissions within a finite time horizon, the proposed algorithm can intelligently determine whether some immediate results during a query evaluation need to be materialized for later use of other queries, by making use of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) method with predictions. We finally investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm by simulations, and results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is promising, by achieving a higher system throughput while reducing the average evaluation cost per query by from 20% to 52% compared to the comparison benchmarks.",10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9148843,Q.

Situation Awareness of Energy Internet of Things in Smart City Based on Digital Twin: From Digitization to Informatization,2023,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.41608029139433783,"Rapid growth of diversity, uncertainty, and coupling effect of units in modern energy systems jointly challenges the traditional model-based situation awareness (SA) in Energy Internet of Things (EIoT). This work explores the digital twin of EIoT (EIoT-DT) and then provides a novel data-driven SA paradigm, named DT-SA, as a promising alternative. Based on the combination of the latest data technologies and machine learning algorithms, DT-SA transfers those stubborn SA challenges to digital space, and then addresses them by building a domain-specific and data-friendly digital twin (DT) model upon massive data. The established model can be quantitatively tested via iterative virtual–real interaction and, thus, be evaluated and updated through closed-loop feedback to improve its performance in the physical world. To this end, some engineering and scientific problems are raised: 1) virtual–real interaction mechanism relevant to resource flow and data flow; 2) unified modeling and analysis of heterogeneous spatial–temporal data; 3) DT configuration and evolution; and 4) domain-specific DT-SA characterization. To solve these problems, cloud-edge-terminal configuration, big data analytics (BDA), DT, and SA indicator systems are studied, respectively. Then, the random matrix theory (RMT) and overarching DT-SA framework are designed as a roadmap. Besides, some potential applications and undergoing projects on the terminal, edge, or cloud are discussed, e.g., condition assessment of equipment, digital monitoring and diagnosis of the power grid network, and EIoT construction in the smart city. Finally, some perspectives and recommendations are proposed in conclusion for future research.

In smart cities, the global mobility network (GLOMONET) supports mobile services between heterogeneous networks of mobile devices such as autonomous vehicles and drones. Recently, Chen et al. proposed a user authentication scheme for GLOMONET in smart cities. Nevertheless, we found some weaknesses in the scheme proposed by them. In this study, we propose a secure lightweight authentication for roaming services in a smart city, called SLARS, to enhance security. We proved that SLARS is more secure and efficient than the related authentication scheme for GLOMONET through security and performance analysis. Our analysis results show that SLARS satisfies all security requirements in GLOMONET and saves 72.7% of computation time compared to that of Chen et al.'s scheme.",10.23919/transcom.2024EBP3004,H.

Eco-city would result in livable and environmentally sustainable communities without resources being wasted or damaging biodiversity. Significant changes in the environmentally acceptable are occurring because of the paradigm change in technology and science brought about by big data research. The planning and design of sustainable cities, as well as their operational management and the use of distributed design approaches and technological solutions, need meticulous attention to detail and the treatment of the whole system. This emerging industry addresses a significant need for bridging the gap between sustainable urbanism and smart city principles. The field of study known as “data-driven smart ecological sustainability” has expanded greatly during the last several years. This paper proposes a big data science and analytics-based persuasive evidence-synthesis framework (BDSA-PESF) for evaluating and planning eco-city development in urban areas. For cities to achieve their sustainability objectives in the face of rapid growth and shifting planning and management systems, data-driven solutions are essential. Pros and downsides of smart urbanism in the context of enacting environmentally friendly urban changes have been examined in this research, prompting more discussions on the topic in the big data era.

Privacy Preserving Deep Computation Model on Cloud for Big Data Feature Learning,2016,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"To improve the efficiency of big data feature learning, the paper proposes a privacy preserving deep computation model by offloading the expensive operations to the cloud. Privacy concerns become evident because there are a large number of private data by various applications in the smart city, such as sensitive data of governments or proprietary information of enterprises. To protect the private data, the proposed model uses the BGV encryption scheme to encrypt the private data and employs cloud servers to perform the high-order back-propagation algorithm on the encrypted data efficiently for deep computation model training. Furthermore, the proposed scheme approximates the Sigmoid function as a polynomial function to support the secure computation of the activation function with the BGV encryption. In our scheme, only the encryption operations and the decryption operations are performed by the client while all the computation tasks are performed on the cloud. Experimental results show that our scheme is improved by approximately 2.5 times in the training efficiency compared to the conventional deep computation model without disclosing the private data using the cloud computing including ten nodes. More importantly, our scheme is highly scalable by employing more cloud servers, which is particularly suitable for big data.",10.1109/TC.2015.2470255,Q. Zhang; L. T. Yang; Z. Chen

Research and Application of Grey Principal Component Analysis in Big Data Analytics,2023,-1,Outliers,0.1785242445402669,"Predictive analysis is one of the most important application fields of big data analytics, which can predict uncertain events by combining various advanced analysis functions, especially statistical analysis and other methods. Big data analytics technology is mainly applied in business intelligence, government decision-making, public services and so on. In response to the shortcomings of principal component analysis method in processing data with time series, a new model, namely grey principal component analysis (GPCA), is proposed by combining grey system thinking with classical principal component analysis based on the characteristics of data with time series in grey systems. Time series analysis can not only quantitatively reveal the development and changes of a certain phenomenon, but also dynamically depict the internal quantitative relationships and changes between a certain phenomenon and other phenomena. Through the generation and development of series, the grey system theory devotes itself to the discussion of practical laws, while mathematical statistics devotes itself to the study of statistical historical laws. Combining the advantages of the two methods to solve time series problems, the system was implemented using object-oriented programming methods. The application of this method to the comprehensive evaluation of living environment indicators in Dalian highlights the impact of new time series data on the entire data, and the analysis results can provide valuable decision-making basis for decision-makers. The experimental results indicate that the use of grey principal component analysis is more effective and can accurately reflect the impact of time on the sample data.",10.1109/ICCEA58433.2023.10135466,C.

Then, the key evaluation indicators and their characteristic weights are screened out by applying Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Mathematical methods, so as to obtain the final comprehensive evaluation results and assign a graded carbon efficiency code to green energy power generation. Finally, combined with the examples, it is verified that the research method proposed in this paper can quantify the carbon efficiency level of green power generation projects, and can reflect the carbon reduction efficiency of green energy power generation projects in a more comprehensive way.",10.1109/CEEPE62022.2024.10586574,Y.

Patents analysis is widely viewed as one of the major tools to tracking the development of technologies. In traditional patent analysis methods, some given keywords are used to query big data patent information from related patent web sites, and then analyze some trends of big data. But big data techniques are involved in a lot of applications, different patent applicants have different subjectivities in the setting for keywords. In view of this problem, we proposed a new method for patent analysis of big data in a more precise way, based on the analysis of big data patent abstracts in China's domestic. Our method extracted keywords from the abstract of big data patent documents to obtain more accurate data for a deeper analysis of patents. Through this study, we found that the development of big data in China's domestic can be divided into two distinct stages and it entered into a quickly growth stage after 2008. Industry development is faster than the academic community; of which Huawei has the most quantities of patent applications. There is a serious unbalance in the development of big data technology in China, and the development in the eastern region is far beyond that in the western region.

Visual Big Data Analytics for Sustainable Agricultural Development,2018,0,Topic_0_agriculture_agricultural_food,1.0,"To achieve the highest levels of agricultural production, it is first necessary to fully understand the information underpinning complex agricultural systems. This can be achieved through the use of the latest monitoring technology which can generate a constant stream of data concerning the agricultural environment in quantities hitherto unseen. When these data are analyzed, farmers and government advisors are able to use the information to guide adjustments in their activities to enhance productivity. While this kind of approach has been widespread in many industrial sectors, Thai agriculture has not yet seen its implementation on a wide scale. This may partly explain the economic successes in industry while agriculture has lagged behind, especially in terms of worker remuneration. One further problem is that a majority of farmers do not have the education required to take advantage of technology and data analysis. This study therefore seeks to establish a framework to support the use of data analytics in the agricultural context, through the development of a web-based application capable of displaying performance data in farming and thus solving the key issues in the agricultural sector to support farmers.

Improved Multi-Order Distributed HOSVD with Its Incremental Computing for Smart City Services,2021,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.6807253336035056,"Smart city, a focus of many researchers from academia and industry, is a successful example of Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). Based on the rapid and efficient processing of large-scale data, Smart city, an example of CPSS, has revolutionized the service provision model by providing proactive services for humans. However, to operationalize the services provided in smart cities, a comprehensive analysis of heterogeneous and large-scale big data is required. Further, to speed up data processing and improve the adaptability and extensibility of big data, CPSS big data processing should be realized in the form of blocks and avoid redundant computing on historical data. In this paper, as an extension of multi-order distributed and incremental High-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) computing, Ring-based Tree algorithm and Tree-based Tree algorithm are proposed for the problems of increasing scale of processable data and computational efficiency. The experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of error, improvement factor, and improvement factor ratio. At last, to demonstrate the performance of our improved algorithms, a case study about CPSS big data processing is provided.",10.1109/TSUSC.2018.2881439,X. Wang; L. T. Yang; X. Chen; M. J. Deen; J.

End-Edge-Cloud Collaborative System: A Video Big Data Processing and Analysis Architecture,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.3059178013687858,"In the current surveillance system, video streams are firstly captured and compressed at the cameras, and then transmitted to the backend severs or cloud for big data analysis. It is impractical to aggregate all video streams from hundreds of thousands of cameras for big data analysis. Transcoding the videos to low-bitrate ones is the conventional solution to solve the aggregation bottleneck. However, it is recognized that transcoding will inevitably affect visual feature extraction, consequently degrading the subsequent analysis performance. To address these challenges, we thus propose a new video big data analysis framework, called end-edge-cloud collaborative system. Under the end-edge-cloud collaborative framework, a camera can output two streams simultaneously, including a compressed video stream for viewing and data storage, and a compact feature stream extracted from the original video signals for visual analysis. Video stream and feature stream are synchronized by unified identification. We identify three key technologies to enable the end-edge-cloud collaborative system, including analysis-friendly video coding, visual feature compact descriptor, and user-defined neural network and parameter updating. By real-time feeding only the feature streams into the cloud center, these cameras thus form a large-scale brain-like vision system for the smart city. A prototype has been implemented to demonstrate its feasibility. Experiment results show that our system can achieve high efficient video compression and guarantee the analysis performance. Furthermore, our system makes the big data analysis feasible which only need aggregate low bit-rate compressed feature stream.",10.1109/MIPR49039.2020.00055,P. Xing; Y. Wang; P. Peng; Y. Tian; T.

Automatic Concept Extraction Based on Semantic Graphs From Big Data in Smart City,2020,-1,Outliers,0.10302883636444539,"With the rapid development of smart cities, various types of sensors can rapidly collect a large amount of data, and it becomes increasingly important to discover effective knowledge and process information from massive amounts of data. Currently, in the field of knowledge engineering, knowledge graphs, especially domain knowledge graphs, play important roles and become the infrastructure of Internet knowledge-driven intelligent applications. Domain concept extraction is critical to the construction of domain knowledge graphs. Although there have been some works that have extracted concepts, semantic information has not been fully used. However, the excellent concept extraction results can be obtained by making full use of semantic information. In this article, a novel concept extraction method, Semantic Graph-Based Concept Extraction (SGCCE), is proposed. First, the similarities between terms are calculated using the word co-occurrence, the LDA topic model and Word2Vec. Then, a semantic graph of terms is constructed based on the similarities between the terms. Finally, according to the semantic graph of the terms, community detection algorithms are used to divide the terms into different communities where each community acts as a concept. In the experiments, we compare the concept extraction results that are obtained by different community detection algorithms to analyze the different semantic graphs. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method. This method can effectively use semantic information, and the results of the concept extraction are better from domain big data in smart cities.",10.1109/TCSS.2019.2946181,J. Qiu; Y. Chai; Z.

Big Data Analytics and Network Calculus Enabling Intelligent Management of Autonomous Vehicles in a Smart City,2019,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to dramatically change future intelligent transportation in smart cities. AVs are envisaged to evolve to a service rather than a product in the future. To provide best user experience of such services, three primary factors, namely, waiting time, travel time, and supply of AV services, are taken into consideration in a multiobjective optimization. Conventional optimization of services relies on traffic flow analysis over a queuing network model. However, due to the mobility of vehicles and the transfer uncertainty of road networks, the queuing network analysis is too complicated and practically intractable. For accuracy and convenient processing, network calculus (NC) is extended to model the queueing problem in this paper. The optimal number of available AVs can be identified by guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. The satisfaction of AV services can be viewed as a supply and demand problem, and optimized by bipartite graph matching. In order to reduce the average travel time, especially for rush hours with heavy traffic, we further propose a new online AVs fleet management scheme with congestion control for smart cities. It is shown that the intelligent management of AV fleet can be efficiently achieved, outperforming the cases of traditional vehicles.

Hybrid AI and Big Data Solutions for Dynamic Urban Planning and Smart City Optimization,2024,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.4561864374832213,"Urban planning faces complex challenges, including efficient resource allocation, traffic management, and infrastructure optimization. Traditional methods often fall short in addressing these multifaceted issues, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. This study introduces a novel approach by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Simulated Annealing (SA) to tackle these challenges in urban planning. GNNs are employed to extract meaningful features and relationships from urban infrastructure and social networks, providing a detailed understanding of patterns and interactions. SA is then used to optimize resource allocation, traffic routing, and scheduling tasks based on the insights derived from GNNs. This hybrid methodology allows for an iterative refinement process, where updated features from GNNs continuously enhance the optimization performed by SA. Key findings of the study reveal significant improvements. Traffic congestion was reduced by 25%, and average travel times decreased by 18%. Resource allocation efficiency improved by 30%, with a 20% reduction in resource wastage. Infrastructure optimization metrics showed a 22% gain in cost efficiency and a 15% increase in accessibility. The combined GNN-SA approach proved effective in addressing urban planning inefficiencies and optimizing various aspects of smart city management. The contributions of this study include a robust framework for integrating advanced AI techniques to solve complex urban planning problems, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for modern smart cities. The results highlight the potential of hybrid AI approaches in enhancing urban planning and provide a foundation for future research and application in this field.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3516544,W.

Big Data Analytics for Safe and Secure City,2018,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"The world's population continues to grow. Today, there are more than 7 billion people on earth. That number increased 180 percent from 1950 where the earth's population reached only 2.5 billion people. The growing number of populations poses great challenges for the government. In general, urban populations tend to be better than rural populations, with greater access to public services such as transportation, education and health care, as well as higher literacy rates and life expectancy. Driven by these benefits, the global population tends to increase in the level of urbanization. Today, more than half the world's population lives in urban areas, and by 2050, this number will grow to 70 percent. Much of the growth of urbanization will come from developing countries, which are expected to double their urban population from 2.5 billion in 2009 to nearly 5.2 billion by 2050. Such statistics are needed to give a sense of the scale of the challenges facing governments and city planners. It is important to look beyond statistics to answer people-centered questions about what life is like in these cities. In other words, focus should not only be about how these future cities can be made possible, but how they will support those who live in them. Each city can propose different answers to these questions, based on unique geographical, economic or social circumstances. Articulating an ideal city vision often requires a difficult choice between competing or even conflicting goals.

Drivers of Big Data Analytics’ Adoption and Implications of Management Decision-Making on Big Data Adoption and Firms’ Financial and Nonfinancial Performance: Evidence From Nigeria's Manufacturing and Service Industries,2024,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.2934006799231565,"Despite advances in big data analytics (BDA), its traditional adoption utility discourse is yet to move beyond early capture to focus on its postadoption impacts on firms’ financial performance (FP) and nonfinancial performance (NFP), especially in developing economies like Nigeria's. This study advances the BDA field, whose existing utilitarian discourse on organizational readiness for change does not generally reflect the empirical and analytical reality of 261 Nigerian professionals. By drawing on business-to-business marketing, dynamic capabilities, and technology-organization-environment theoretical frameworks, we first contribute a conceptual model (see Fig. 1) to develop nine testable hypotheses to initially highlight which factors really impact on organizations' readiness to adopt BDA, second, to show the real impacts of management's post-BDA-adoption, which existing scholarship on BDA discourse had missed. Consequently, our study's findings were used to develop Fig. 2, showing the direct and moderating nature of interactions between BDA and TOE variables, from which hypotheses one and two demonstrate support for the technological and value creation of BDA adoption. However, whereas hypotheses three and four confirm top management's support and overall organizational readiness for BDA adoption in line with existing literature, paradoxically, this study's hypotheses five and seven contribute to the existing BDA discourse by highlighting that environmental, competitive pressure (CP), including regulation does not support the adoption of BDA. Additionally, while external support (H6) was found conducive for BDA adoption in line with current literature. Interestingly, hypotheses eight, nine, and 10a were also found supportive of not only FP but also NFP. However, contrary to current theorization, hypothesis 10b was not found supportive of NFP. Therefore, contrary to previous TOE scholarship, our results contribute to the BDA discourse additionally showing how CP and regulatory environment are not significantly supportive of BDA adoption; second, by highlighting how TOE's critical regulation and competition factors for BDA adoption are additionally nonimpactful on management's decision to adopt BDA. Finally, additional moderating factors particularly on external competition and government regulatory compliance are critical in ascertaining not only organizations’ FP but also their NFP readiness in the Nigerian context. The implications and limitations are discussed.",10.1109/TEM.2023.3321426,A. Egwuonwu; J. Mendy; E. Smart-Oruh; A. Egwuonwu

Tutorial: Internet of Things and the upcoming wireless sensor networks related with the use of big data in mapping services; issues of smart cities,2016,-1,Outliers,0.16504075094423643,"Some years ago we used to talk about a very far future, a dream in where people can access to services and information into small devices; in which we can accesses to information, make calls, watch videos and surf maps. That far future is not so far, actually the advance of technology involves a more powerful hardware which is day to day is becoming into small devices with big resources [14]. The upcoming development of electronic allows that these devices could be integrated into smart networks [8]; these networks are called Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN; [13]). WSN do not need physical connections, they use communication systems such as ZigBEE, WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM [7]. Each individual device called moth have autonomous characteristics of communications, storage of data, automatic organization and recovery of the network communication among others that allow the network performs an autonomous work, with the possibility of Internet connection. These characteristic let emerge the so called Internet of Things (IoT), phrase that was coined in the early 1990's, where everyday objects have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data [1]. Since these days, technology has an exponential advance and now it is possible to find devices that permit earth observations in real time [11,15,4]. All this collected information use cloud and no-cloud storage [3]. These systems allow to store big amounts of data [6], that is collected from devices integrated in the concept of IoT [5] (especially incomes from smartphones, GPS's devices and various earth observation sensors). The analysis of this big data (some of them spatial information) will be helpful in treatment and finding related solutions in specific areas such as public administration, environment, urban services, etc. [12]. Also, the data that at the beginning was depicted like sparse information, it begins to converge into a shape. This shape can be seen like maps that could be paper maps or digital ones. The representation of the information into maps is linked to a wide range of disciplines and the concept is not new but the enhancement that it has reached until now is incredible, especially the digital information given in Internet which could be accessed by electronic devices (smart phones, tablets and computers). E-government services would improve efficiency and consequently citizen's satisfaction due to the implementation of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI, [9]). In order to good development of SDI, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OCG) has an important role. OGC is an international industry consortium of companies, government agencies and universities participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available interface standards [10]. One of the most popular OGC standards is the Web Map Service (WMS) that allows to show spatial information, considered fundamental for the development of many of the services in the way that a citizen can access to e-government services (e.g., cadastre, [2]) and e-democracy. In this talk, the objective is to introduce some concepts considered essential in the development of the modern society and smart cities. Concepts such as IoT, big data and mapping not only allow the collection or merely visualization of information; these promote the enhancement of access to e-services, also they could be used to face challenges that a good administration of the limited resources implies.",10.1109/ICEDEG.2016.7461464,V.

Digital Forensics Challenges to Big Data in the Cloud,2017,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.6450609741936533,"As a new research area, Digital Forensics is a subject in a rapidly developing society. Cyber Security for Big Data in the Cloud is getting more attention than ever. A computing breach requires digital forensics to seize digital evidence to determine who is responsible and what has been done maliciously and the possible further consequences. In particular, for Big Data attack cases, Digital Forensics is facing even more challenge for earlier digital breach investigations. For the PPI (Protection of Personal Information) a GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law has been launched to be implemented from the 25th May 2018. This compulsory regulation will have an important impact on healthcare PPI in the cloud (ICO, 2017, Deloitte, 2014). Nowadays, Big Data with the characteristics of three “V”s (Volume, Velocity, and Variety), are either synchronized with the Cloud, or stored in the Cloud, in order to solve the storage capacity and so on problems, which made Digital Forensics investigation even more difficult. The Big Data Digital Forensics issue for the Cloud is difficult. One of them is the need to identify which physical devices have been compromised. Data are distributed in the Cloud, so the customer or digital forensics practitioner cannot have full access control like the traditional investigation does. Smart City are making use of ICT (information communications technology) to collect, detect, analyze and integrate the key information data of core systems in running the cities. Meanwhile, the Control Centre is making intelligent responses to different requirements that include daily livelihood, PPI security, environmental protection, public safety, industrial and commercial activities and city services. The Smart City healthcare Big Data are collected and gathered by the IoT (Internet of Things) (Liu, 2014, Qi, 2016) and applying GDPR prevent Cyberstalking and Cybercrimes.

Intelligent methods for managing geospatial data at the US federal government,2017,-1,Outliers,0.1298421839976541,"In many operations, the US government depends on geospatial data to obtain insights and drive policy making. Federal data are usually pulled from multiple sources, aggregated differently, and formatted in an assortment of standards. Analysts have been overwhelmed by the ample amounts of inconsistent and unstructured data available to them; the main quandary is that they are unable to draw clear conclusions from that data without proper analytics. Moreover, when dealing with geospatial data, the challenge of data management can exacerbate. Geospatial data (including longitudes, latitudes, country codes, addresses and many other forms) are applied at many governmental use-cases such as: census, military operations, natural disasters, economical research, agricultural commodities' production, US trade, and many others. To address such dire needs, this paper introduces a novel method (called G-Fed) for geospatial data management at the federal government. G-Fed provides tools for streaming, validating, aggregating, and presenting data. Furthermore, G-Fed utilizes the power of big data analytics to drive its processes. Software engineering best practices are also applied within G-Fed; such as multithreading, security roles, on-demand data tools, standardization, and accessibility. The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report to point to the matter of federal data management. GAO's report identified fourteen issues that governmental agencies need to solve to overcome their data challenges. Efficiency pressures and federal budget constraints are pushing data implementations towards more automation, extra validation, and higher security. Additionally, the Open Data and the Big Data Initiatives (signed in 2012) have put more pressure on the backs of agencies to make their data (including geospatial) open and available to the public. However, without having state-of-the-art data repositories, it is not possible to address such demands. This paper addresses these issues by presenting a step-by-step set of guidelines. G-Fed aims to help agencies organize geospatial data in a manner that makes it possible to publish, and be provided online to the keen American public. A data repository of public government data is used for experimentation of G-Fed. Experimental results are recorded and presented.",10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2017.8046995,F. A. Batarseh; R. Yang

Research on intelligent information management systems and its promotion mechanism using big data technology,2022,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.646197682059046,"With the development of information society, big data has led the change of society. As the core part of government performance management, government performance evaluation is an important “booster” to improve government administrative efficiency and promote the transformation of government functions. The government’s responsibility is to undertake the obligation to serve the society and protect the fundamental rights and interests of the people. Government performance evaluation is a professional and specific procedure that combines quantitative and qualitative measurements to accurately evaluate the final performance results of government departments in the management process, so as to test and assess whether or to what extent the government has fulfilled its responsibilities. Government performance evaluation not only realizes the core values and public accountability goals of the government, but also is an effective mechanism for implementing government accountability. However, in reality, there are still many problems in China’s government in fulfilling its responsibilities and running performance evaluation mechanisms. This paper analyzes the current dilemmas and problems in local government performance evaluation based on government responsibility, and then proposes countermeasures to improve the government performance evaluation mechanism under the perspective of government responsibility, thus providing a theoretical basis for the implementation of the correct concept of performance.",10.1109/ICPECA53709.2022.9718957,B.

Responsible AI for Government Program Evaluation and Performance Audits,2024,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.43385123551453325,"With the proliferation of user-friendly generative-AI tools, many government agencies, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, have started exploring how these tools could improve one of their primary functions: managing grant programs to distribute funds for research. Government bans on the use of generative-AI for initial grant application evaluation limits the use of this technology. However, this research shows that a post hoc evaluative approach within the domain of Responsible AI provides a means by which government agencies can evaluate the big data collected through their grant programs. This proposed framework, Responsible AI for Evaluation (RAI-E), achieves this goal by curating big governmental administrative data using grant evaluation rubrics followed by model fine-tuning for agency-specific evaluation tasks. Convergence between model- and human-generated evaluations then enables robust diagnosis of grant program equity and fairness via Responsible AI and algorithm auditing methods. Preliminary experiments show improved model performance through the instruction-tuning of open source language models for evaluating government grant applications. Further research will explore the auditing of the underlying algorithms, devising a method for algorithm-in-the-loop frameworks to aid government administrators in evaluating their human-driven program performance.",10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825518,D.

Research and Application of Grey Factor Analysis in Big Data Analytics,2022,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.31923826099091845,"Predictive analysis is one of the most important application fields of big data analytics, which can predict uncertain events by combining various advanced analysis functions, especially statistical analysis and other methods. Big data analytics technology is mainly applied in business intelligence, government decision-making, public services and so on. Factor analysis is one of the methods in classical statistics, which can only give the distribution degree and variation of data based on the mean value, and can not reflect the characteristics of data objects changing with time, so it is not suitable for solving the statistical analysis problem of big data objects based on time series. In order to make up for the deficiency of factor analysis of big data with time series, according to the characteristics of time series in grey system, that is, grey system theory devotes itself to the discussion of realistic laws through the generation and development of sequences, while mathematical statistics devotes itself to the study of statistical historical laws.

Take the best of big data: Just focus on some of its V's,2017,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,1.0,"Big data represents a new technology for managing data with high velocity, volume, variety and contributes to creating value for companies. As quoted in1, capturing all queries made on the company website or from customer support calls, emails or chat lines, regardless of their outcome, may have significant value in identifying emerging trends. The Big Data Era has largely contributed in accelerating the development strategic plans issued from governments and research organisms, coving the management, exploitation and analysis of these data by taking into account the different V's of Big Data. Among these plans, we can cite for instance the development of: (a) large-scale platforms (ex. data-clusters, distributed data clusters), (b) Software Defined Environments (SDE) (ex. IBM SDE), (c) advanced programming paradigms (ex. map-reduce, Spark, etc.), Data Analytics Tools (Rapid Miner, Google Fusion Tables, Solver), (d) Visualization tools (Google Chart, Tableau, Oracle Visual Analyzer), and (h) high quality and valuable Knowledge Bases (KB), constructed either by academicians (e.g., Cvc, DBpedia, Freebase, and YAGO) and industrials (e.g., Google Knowledge Graph, Facebook Knowledge Graph, Amazon Knowledge Graph, Credit Rating Agencies, Enterprise Knowledge Base, etc.). In this talk, we would like to foster the creation of a think tank dedicated to getting the best from Big Data V's and the efforts related to it to revisit our research activities without compromising them. In this talk, we would like to share the experience conducted with our Model and Data Engineering Team of the LIAS Laboratory at ISAE-ENSMA, which aims at the design of data warehousing applications. Based on the literature, this design is based on two main approaches: (i) a supply-driven approach (also called data-driven) that starts with an analysis of operational data sources in order to identify all the available data and (ii) a user-driven approach (also known as requirement-driven or goal-orientated) which stems from the determination of the information requirements of different business users. Several studies and experiments show that resorting to these two approaches entails a high risk for companies, since some functional requirements cannot be satisfied. This is due to the lack of relevant data in sources. In parallel, reference studies have identified the crucial role of knowledge bases (KB) for analytical tasks, by offering analysts more entities (people, places, products, etc.). The availability of a huge, high quality valuable KB is an asset for data warehousing designers and decision-makers to construct/exploit a valuable data warehouse. So, faced with this situation, we here present a value-driven approach that revisits the traditional life cycle of the design of data warehouses, by considering KB as an external resource.

However, most of the existing privacy preserving models cannot to be used to resist attacks with continuously growing background knowledge. This paper presents the method of applying differential privacy to protect the citizens' privacy information. By generalizing the citizens' sensitive information, the anonymity sets satisfying (K, L)-anonymity model are constructed, then differential method is used to add Laplace noise in the anonymity sets. Thus the citizen's privacy information can be protected even if the attacker gets strong background knowledge. Because the grouped information reduces the sensitivity of the query, the availability of citizens' information after adding noise can be guaranteed. The steps and usefulness of the discussed privacy preservation method is illustrated by an example.",10.1109/ICEBE.2016.035,Y. Shi; C. Piao; X. Pan

Impact of Organizational Factors on Big Data Analytics Adoptions in U.S. Public Sector Organizations,2021,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.2886099220583256,"Although big data analytics (BDA) have demonstrated the ability to increase productivity when successfully adopted, organizations of all types still struggle to achieve sufficient value to offset the costs of BDA adoption. In the public sector, innovative technology adoption always carries political risk, as neither political overseers nor the media nor the public will tolerate failed projects that may be viewed as irresponsible or wasteful misuses of public resources. While substantial research has been conducted on the technical aspects of BDA adoption, little research has been conducted on the organizational aspects. Furthermore, the small amount of research conducted on organizational factors occurred in the private sector and was constrained to if the organizational context influenced adoption outcomes rather than how the organizational context influenced outcomes. The purpose of this parallel, nested mixed-methods study is to provide a deep exploration of how and why varying forms of organizational architecture impact the outcomes of BDA adoption in U.S. public sector organizations. The theoretical significance of this ongoing research will be to fill a gap in the literature exploring the impact of organizational forms on BDA adoptions as a system, generally, and the dearth of research on public sector organizations, specifically. The practical contribution of this research will be to reduce uncertainty associated with organizational factors, allowing public sector managers to make risk-informed decisions on BDA adoption. Better informed decisions on BDA adoption should reduce the incidence rate of organizations failing to achieve sufficient public value to justify adoption costs and ease the burden on taxpayers and nonprofit donors caused by failed public sector BDA adoptions. This ongoing research will be complete in Spring 2022.",10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671758,G. Smith; S. Miller

In recent years, organizations have started to capitalize on the significant use of big data for analyses to gain valuable insights to improve decision-making processes. In this regard, leveraging and unleashing the potential of big data has become a significant success factor for steering firms' competitiveness, and the related literature is increasing at a very high pace. Thus, the authors propose a bibliometric study to understand the most important insights from these studies and enrich existing conceptual models. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors use a bibliometric review on articles related to the use of big data for firms' competitiveness. The authors examine the contributions of research constituents (authors, institutions, countries and journals) and their structural and thematic relationships (collaborations, co-citations networks, co-word networks, thematic trends and thematic map). The most important insights are used to enrich a conceptual model. Findings Based on the performance analysis results, the authors found that China is by far the most productive country in this research field. However, in terms of influence (by the number of citations per article), the most influential countries are the UK, Australia and the USA, respectively. Based on the science mapping analysis results, the most important findings are projected in the common phases of competitive intelligence processes and include planning and directions concepts, data collection concepts, data analysis concepts, dissemination concepts and feedback concepts. This projection is supplemented by cross-cutting themes such as digital transformation, cloud computing, privacy, data science and competition law.

In this study, we (1) propose the framework to explore the features of open data portals, (2) apply the developed framework to open data portals of 116 out of 183 smart cities covered by Cities in Motion Index 2022, i.e., to all smart cities that have an open data portal, conducting their assessment by experts, which made it possible to (3) identify the most commonly implemented features, as well as the most promising, but not necessarily frequently implemented, and based on the results of the assessment, (4) identify additional features that could potentially be implemented to improve user-centricity, usability, and accessibility, thereby refining the used framework, proposing a list of 30 evidence-informed practices. Considering our findings and the most common characteristics that enabled us to identify common design patterns, we also define a 5-level readiness framework of the smart city portals, thereby providing a developmental roadmap for advancing their readiness. We conclude that an open data portal is integral to a smart city’s data ecosystem. However, to draw conclusions about the resilience and sustainability of this ecosystem, we must consider all its relevant components that synergically affect its development.",10.1016/j.tele.2025.102284,"Lnenicka, Martin; Nikiforova, Anastasija; Wang, Di; Bernardini, Flávia"

Climate smart cities? Technologies of climate governance in Brazil,2022,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Cities are fundamental agents and spaces in global climate governance, whether through their participation in transnational climate networks, urban sustainability innovation, experimentation, or the use of low-carbon digital technologies in urban governance, a phenomenon known as climate-smart city. In Brazil, few studies have addressed this issue. Thus, here I analyze the political agenda and economic dynamics involved in the transformation of Brazil's second largest city, Rio de Janeiro, into a climate-smart city. I develop an original conceptualization of “techno-utopian smart city” and apply this framework to analyze the case of Rio. Empirically, I perform a thematic content analysis, including the coding of policy documents, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest that the smart city agenda is still limited to address the challenges of climate change. While smart city and climate policies have been sparsely integrated, “smart” urbanism has privileged the financial, economic, and political dividends of a techno-driven urban transformation, rather than focusing on citizen well-being, climate change mitigation, and adaptation. My conceptualization and empirical analysis suggest that Rio de Janeiro has been i) framing climate governance as a technical issue instead of a complex social challenge, ii) neglecting the environmental footprint of smart technologies, and iii) collecting citizens’ private data with low levels of transparency.",10.1016/j.ugj.2022.08.002,"Mendes, Vinícius"

A global review of the uptake and impact of NoSQL, blockchain, and big data analytics on the land administration sector",2019,-1,Outliers,0.12009107618583613,"Unstructured data, non-relational databases, distributed databases, and big data analytics potentially change the landscape for digital land data creation, use, management, and dissemination. The way land data is governed and the resultant impact on land tenure security delivery is open to substantial re-thinking. Drawing from international cases, this paper provides a state-of-the-art examination of prototypes and demonstrators from the global land sector. The aim is to deliver an insight into the opportunities, challenges, impacts, and future scenarios regarding the application of the emerging technologies. The paper finds that whilst uptake of non-relational and distributed databases is occurring, it remains largely at the level of proof-of-concept, demonstrator or pilot. Scaled uptake is occurring slower than anticipated, and to a lesser degree than in other sectors. However, the broader and longer-term impacts on the land sector remain difficult to judge. Meanwhile, emerging distributed analytical databases appear to be under-exploited or at least underexplored within the land sector. Overall, the examined technologies are seen to enable new operational approaches for conventional land sector transactions, and also entirely new land related services, digital products, and actors: the ways and means of holding, transferring, and securing land may become more nuanced, fractionalized, and/or automated. Whether these observed embryonic developments lead to sector transformation or orderly transition, is seen to be heavily reliant on the prevailing political, socio-cultural and institutional settings within a jurisdiction.",10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.02.016,"Bennett, Rohan Mark; Pickering, M.; Sargent, J."

Cybersecurity in local governments: A systematic review and framework of key challenges,2025,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.4169537616469564,"Cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern in modern urban governance, as local governments now extend their responsibilities beyond traditional infrastructure management to safeguard digital systems and citizen data in increasingly digitised smart city environments. Despite the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, there is a concerning gap—i.e., local governments often exhibit a cybersecurity posture that is inadequately prepared to counter the rising cyber threats. This discrepancy underscores the urgency for a comprehensive understanding of the challenges restricting effective cybersecurity in local governmental settings. This paper aims to elucidate these challenges of local governments in a structured framework utilising a systematic literature review method named the PRISMA protocol. The findings reveal that the stakes are high when it comes to cybersecurity for local governments, with the key challenges being financial resource constraints, technological vulnerabilities, human factors, and the regulatory framework. This study recommends improving interdepartmental coordination, adopting relevant policies, and executing targeted cybersecurity training to address these challenges. The study also highlights unconventional approaches to mitigate financial and skill resource limitations, including the utilisation of open-source security tools, outsourcing specific cybersecurity functions, and establishing collaborations with local cybersecurity agencies, academic institutions, and the private sector to obtain expertise and advanced resources. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the critical cybersecurity challenges faced by local governments and provides specific recommendations, equipping urban policymakers, administrators, and researchers with valuable guidance to enhance cybersecurity resilience within this critical yet understudied research domain.",10.1016/j.ugj.2024.12.010,"Hossain, Sk Tahsin; Yigitcanlar, Tan; Nguyen, Kien; Xu, Yue"
Using big data for evidence based governance in child welfare,2015,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.7132625369013618,"Numerous approaches are available for improving governance of the child welfare system, all of which require longitudinal data reporting on child welfare clients. A substantial amount of agency administrative information – big data – can be transformed into knowledge for policy and management actions through a rigorous information generation process. Important properties of the information generation process are that it must generate accurate, timely information while protecting the confidentiality of the clients. In addition, it must be extensible to serve an ever-changing policy and technology environment. Knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD), aka data science, is a method developed in the private sector to mine consumer data and can be used in public settings to support evidence based governance. KDD consists of a rigorous 5-step process that includes a Web-based end-user interface. The relationship between KDD and governance is a continuous feedback cycle that enables ongoing development of new information and knowledge as stakeholders identify emerging needs. In this paper, we synthesis the different frameworks for utilizing big data for public governance, introduce the KDD process, describe the nature of big data in child welfare, and then present an updated KDD architecture that can support these frameworks to utilize big data for governance. We also demonstrate the role KDD plays in child welfare management through 2 case studies.

Applications of ML/DL in the management of smart cities and societies based on new trends in information technologies: A systematic literature review,2022,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.3365579852306442,"The goal of managing smart cities and societies is to maximize the efficient use of finite resources while enhancing the quality of life. To establish a sustainable urban existence, smart cities use some new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Drones (IoD), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The created data by these technologies are submitted to analytics to obtain new information for increasing the smart societies and cities' efficiency and effectiveness. Also, smart traffic management, smart power, and energy management, city surveillance, smart buildings, and patient healthcare monitoring are the most common applications in smart cities. However, the Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) approach all hold a lot of promise for managing automated activities in smart cities. Therefore, we discuss different research issues and possible research paths in which the aforementioned techniques might help materialize the smart city notion. The goal of this research is to offer a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of smart city and society management, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that require further investigation and consideration. IoT, cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, IoD, IoV, and hybrid models are the seven key emerging developments in information technology that, in this paper, are considered to categorize the state-of-the-art techniques.

"Context-Contingent Privacy Concerns and Exploration of the Privacy Paradox in the Age of AI, Augmented Reality, Big Data, and the Internet of Things: Systematic Review",2025,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,0.7745103543926868,"Background Despite extensive research into technology users’ privacy concerns, a critical gap remains in understanding why individuals adopt different standards for data protection across contexts. The rise of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and big data has created rapidly evolving and complex privacy landscapes. However, privacy is often treated as a static construct, failing to reflect the fluid, context-dependent nature of user concerns. This oversimplification has led to fragmented research, inconsistent findings, and limited capacity to address the nuanced challenges posed by these technologies. Understanding these dynamics is especially crucial in fields such as digital health and informatics, where sensitive data and user trust are central to adoption and ethical innovation. Objective This study synthesized existing research on privacy behaviors in emerging technologies, focusing on IoT, AI, AR, and big data. Its primary objectives were to identify the psychological antecedents, outcomes, and theoretical frameworks explaining privacy behavior, and to assess whether insights from traditional online privacy literature, such as e-commerce and social networking, apply to these advanced technologies. It also advocates a context-dependent approach to understanding privacy. Methods A systematic review of 179 studies synthesized psychological antecedents, outcomes, and theoretical frameworks related to privacy behaviors in emerging technologies. Following established guidelines and using leading research databases such as ScienceDirect (Elsevier), SAGE, and EBSCO, studies were screened for relevance to privacy behaviors, focus on emerging technologies, and empirical grounding. Methodological details were analyzed to assess the applicability of traditional privacy findings from e-commerce and social networking to today’s advanced technologies. Results The systematic review revealed key gaps in the privacy literature on emerging technologies, such as IoT, AI, AR, and big data. Contextual factors, such as data sensitivity, recipient transparency, and transmission principles, were often overlooked, despite their critical role in shaping privacy concerns and behaviors. The findings also showed that theories developed for traditional technologies often fall short in addressing the complexities of modern contexts. By synthesizing psychological antecedents, behavioral outcomes, and theoretical frameworks, this study underscores the need for a context-contingent approach to privacy research. Conclusions This study advances understanding of user privacy by emphasizing the critical role of context in data sharing, particularly amid ubiquitous and emerging health technologies. The findings challenge static views of privacy and highlight the need for tailored frameworks that reflect dynamic, context-dependent behaviors. Practical implications include guiding health care providers, policy makers, and technology developers toward context-sensitive strategies that build trust, enhance data protection, and support ethical digital health innovation.

Innovation or reinvention? A systematic and bibliometric review of public sector digital infrastructure,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) has emerged as a foundational enabler of modern digital governance, yet scholarly understanding of its scope, design, and impact remains fragmented. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive systematic review and bibliometric analysis of 1153 scholarly and grey literature sources published between 1998 and April 2025. Our dual-method approach traces the conceptual evolution of DPI, maps key thematic trajectories, and critically examines whether DPI constitutes a genuine innovation or a reconfiguration of prior digital government paradigms. The analysis reveals a predominant focus on exploratory and practice-oriented studies, with limited empirical and longitudinal research. Notably, current framings position DPI in techno-solutionist terms, while overlooking crucial socio-technical elements, including legal and institutional infrastructures, digital readiness, and regional interoperability. In response to these gaps, we propose a more nuanced and multidimensional definition of DPI that integrates overlooked non-technical components. We further posit that DPI should not be reduced to technical artefacts but recognised as a dynamic socio-technical construct with profound implications for inclusivity, public value, and sustainable digital transformation. Our findings contribute to clarifying the conceptual boundaries of DPI and advancing a more grounded understanding that can inform both academic research and institutional practice. We conclude with a forward-looking research agenda, calling for interdisciplinary research, participatory policy design, and context-sensitive evaluation frameworks for DPI implementation.",10.1016/j.joitmc.2025.100593,"Lusi, Josephine; Lorenz, Birgy; Pappel, Ingrid"
Value creation for realising the sustainable development goals: Fostering organisational adoption of big data analytics,2021,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.2657047670727754,"The momentum has been building toward the realisation of the United Nations Development Programme's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this regard, technological upgrading through the adoption of innovative technologies, as in big data analytics (BDA), can be seen as a key enabler of helping to address societal challenges. While there is some evidence for realising value created from BDA adoption, organisational issues associated with societal challenges, specifically those targeting the SDGs, are yet to be appreciated. This study utilises a technology–organisation–environment framework to examine the role of top management support in facilitating value creation from BDA adoption for the realisation SDGs. Based on a survey of 320 UK managers, this study found that the technological driver of BDA coupled with top management support, can significantly help in the adoption process. Therefore, crafting the value needed for effectively supporting the realisation of these goals.",10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.10.066,"El-Haddadeh, Ramzi; Osmani, Mohamad; Hindi, Nitham; Fadlalla, Adam"
Transformations of trust in society: A systematic review of how access to big data in energy systems challenges Scandinavian culture,2021,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,0.45832051591717204,"In the era of information technology and big data, the extraction, commodification, and control of personal information is redefining how people relate and interact. However, the challenges that big data collection and analytics can introduce in trust-based societies, like those of Scandinavia, are not yet understood. For instance, in the energy sector, data generated through smart appliances, like smart metering devices, can have collateral implications for the end-users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of scientific articles indexed in Scopus to identify possible relationships between the practices of collecting, processing, analysing, and using people's data and people's responses to such practices. We contextualise this by looking at research about Scandinavian societies and link this to the academic literature on big data and trust, big data and smart meters, data ethics and the energy sector, surveillance capitalism, and subsequently performing a reflexive thematic analysis. We broadly situate our understanding of culture in this context on the interactions between cognitive norms, material culture, and energy practices. Our analysis identified a number of articles discussing problems and solutions to do with the practices of surveillance capitalism. We also found that research addresses these challenges in different ways. While some research focuses on technological amendments to address users’ privacy protection, only few examine the fundamental ethical questions that discuss how big data practices may change societies and increase their vulnerability. The literature suggests that even in highly trusting societies, like the ones found in Scandinavian countries, trust can be undermined and weakened.",10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100079,"Godoy, Jaqueline de; Otrel-Cass, Kathrin; Toft, Kristian Høyer"
Effective and efficient usage of big data analytics in public sector,2020,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.39271549881985246,"Purpose This study aims to achieve three goals: present a holistic, flexible and dynamic model; define the model’s factors and explain how these factors lead to effective and efficient usage of big data; and generate indexes based on experts’ input to rank them based on their importance. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the analytic hierarchy process, a quantitative method of decision-making, to evaluate the importance of the factors presented in the model. The fundamental principle of the overall model is that of a dynamo which is borrowed from electromagnetic physics. The model is also based on three IS theories. Findings Technological advancements and data security are among the most important factors that may impact the effectiveness and efficiency of big data usage. Authentication, governments’ focus on it and transparency and accountability are the most important factors in techno-centric, governmental-centric and user-centric factors, respectively. Research limitations/implications The findings of this paper confirmed earlier findings in the literature and quantitatively assessed some of the factors that were conceptually presented. This paper also presented a framework that can be used in future studies. Practical implications Policy and decision-makers may need to upgrade pertinent technologies such as internet security, frame policies toward information technology (IT) and train the users. Originality/value This paper fills a gap in the literature by presenting a comprehensive study of how different factors dynamically contribute to the effective usage of big data in the public sector.

Smart mobility in Africa: Where are we now?,2025,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7880088638170137,"Cities in emerging economies, especially in Africa, are grappling with transport problems, such as congestion, service fragmentation, inadequate infrastructure and long travel times and distances. These issues negatively impact the liveability of African cities. Despite the potential of smart mobility to address some issues, there is a notable gap in research exploring the aspects of smart mobility that are applicable and effective in the context of emerging economies. This paper explores smart mobility research trends in Africa. A bibliometric analysis technique was used to extract 608 documents from the Scopus and Web of Science core collections, which were analysed using Biblioshiny in R. The results reveal that many studies focused solely on technological solutions, are fragmented, and lack network- or city-wide mobility solutions. Previous research has not considered user perspectives or the likely socio-economic impact of smart mobility. The growth in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics, coupled with the need for personalised and seamless travel, is driving smart mobility research in Africa. Most papers were authored by researchers with African affiliations but based at foreign institutions. The African countries represented are limited to Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and South Africa. There are also low levels of intra-African research collaboration. Further, only 14 documents specifically focused on transport in Africa. Future research should focus on integrating various transport options to achieve customised and sustainable transport solutions.

The prevalence of public values in public private partnerships for government digitalisation: A systematic review of the literature,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7346930326495814,"This study presents a systematic literature review of 74 articles examining public-private partnerships (PPPs) in digitalisation projects, analysing how public values are represented in this literature. It contributes to the literature by systematically mapping how public values are discussed in PPP-driven digitalisation, distinguishing between their role as internal governance mechanisms (internal public value enablers) and their broader societal effects (external public value outcomes). It also identifies gaps in empirical research, particularly in understanding public value conflicts and trade-offs in PPPs. While public values such as efficiency, participation, and accountability are the most frequently cited in the literature, other values such as accessibility, trust and proportionality also emerged. Despite the collaborative nature of PPPs, our review uncovers conflicts between public and private sector motives, emphasizing the need for public sector actors to actively safeguard public values. The study thus contributes to a broader understanding of public values representation in the context of digitalisation projects.",10.1016/j.giq.2025.102048,"Breaugh, Jessica; Hammerschmid, Gerhard; Stockreiter, Simona"
Benefits and Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Public sector: A Literature Review,2025,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"This literature review explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector, assessing its benefits and challenges. The study is motivated by the goal of enhancing efficiency in the public sector. AI can be applied in various areas, including administrative functions, education, and healthcare services. By automating tasks and providing predictive insights from historical data, AI enables smarter and faster processes. This, in turn, improves efficiency in public decision-making and overall service delivery. A systematic literature review by searching in the Scopus database yielded 20 relevant articles. Utilizing a concept matrix, we mapped key concepts and interrelationships within the information systems literature. The matrix reveals that AI adoption in the public sector can enhance efficiency, boost service delivery, and optimize resource allocation through automation and advanced AI utilization. Conversely, the study identifies challenges in AI adoption. Complexities in the adoption process necessitate addressing issues of trust, ethical considerations, and human resource management. Moreover, effective change management is crucial in the adoption process. The findings underscore the need for clear regulatory guidelines and ethical frameworks for AI usage in the public sector. Additionally, investing in training and expertise is vital to ensure responsible and effective AI adoption.",10.1016/j.procs.2025.02.115,"Tveita, Leif Jonas; Hustad, Eli"
Value that matters: intellectual capital and big data to assess performance in healthcare. An empirical analysis on the European context,2020,4,Topic_4_healthcare_health_data,0.6726001762631034,"Purpose The aim of this paper is to analyze and measure the effects of intellectual capital (IC), i.e. human capital (HC), relational capital (RC) and structural capital (SC), on healthcare industry organizational performance and understanding the role of data analytics and big data (BD) in healthcare value creation (Wang et al., 2018). Through the assessment of determined variables specific for each component of IC, the paper identifies the guidelines and suggests propositions for a more efficient response in terms of services provided to citizens and, specifically, patients, as well as predicting effective strategies to improve the care management efficiency in terms of cost reduction. Design/methodology/approach The study has a twofold approach: in the first part, the authors operated a systematic review of the academic literature aiming to enquire the relationship between IC, big data analytics (BDA) and healthcare system, which were also the descriptors employed. In the second part, the authors built an econometric model analyzed through panel data analysis, studying the relationship between IC, namely human, relational and structural capital indicators, and the performance of healthcare system in terms of performance. The study has been conducted on a sample of 28 European countries, notwithstanding the belonging to specific international or supranational bodies, between 2011 and 2016. Findings The paper proposes a data-driven model that presents new approach to IC assessment, extendable to other economic sectors beyond healthcare. It shows the existence of a positive impact (turning into a mathematical inverse relationship) of the human, relational and structural capital on the performance indicator, while the physical assets (i.e. the available beds in hospitals on total population) positively mediates the relationship, turning into a negative impact of non-IC related inputs on healthcare performance. The result is relevant in terms of managerial implications, enhancing the opportunity to highlight the crucial role of IC in the healthcare sector. Research limitations/implications The relationship between IC indicators and performance could be employed in other sectors, disseminating new approaches in academic research. Through the establishment of a relationship between IC factors and performance, the authors implemented an approach in which healthcare organizations are active participants in their economic and social value creation. This challenges the views of knowledge sharing deeply held inside organizations by creating “new value” developed through a more collaborative and permeated approach in terms of knowledge spillovers. A limitation is given by a fragmented policymaking process which carries out different results in each country. Practical implications The analysis provides interesting implications on multiple perspectives. The novelty of the study provides interesting implications for managers, practitioners and governmental bodies. A more efficient healthcare system could provide better results in terms of cost minimization and reduction of hospitalization period. Moreover, dissemination of new scientific knowledge and drivers of specialization enhances best practices sharing in the healthcare sector. On the other hand, an improvement in preventive medicine practices could help in reducing the overload of demand for curative treatments, on the perspective of sharply decreasing the avoidable deaths rate and improving societal standards. Originality/value The authors provide a new holistic framework on the relationship between IC, BDA and organizational performance in healthcare organizations through a systematic review approach and an empirical panel analysis at a multinational level, which is quite a novelty regarding the healthcare. There is little research focussed on healthcare industries' organizational performance, and, specifically, most of the research on IC in healthcare delivered results in terms of theoretical contribution and qualitative analyzes. The authors even contributed to analyze the healthcare industry in the light of the possible existence of synergies and networks among countries.",10.1108/JIC-02-2020-0067,"Gravili, Ginevra; Manta, Francesco; Cristofaro, Concetta Lucia; Reina, Rocco; Toma, Pierluigi"
The role of public sector accounting in the achievement of sustainable development goals: the case of Italy,2025,-1,Outliers,0.09458275924242425,"Purpose This study aims to explore the practical role of governmental accounting in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). It considers the technical aspects of accounting, how accounting affects the society in which it operates (the social role), and expectations as to what accounting should – or should not – do (the moral role). Design/methodology/approach The case of Italy is investigated, and a pragmatic discourse analysis methodology is used to conduct documentary research. Developments in SDG reporting in Italy are examined and assessed as a possible model for other EU member states. Findings The government budgetary processes and SDG initiatives in Italy are evolving. The role of budgeting supported by a sufficiently detailed and multi-purpose chart of accounts is an important consideration. Furthermore, digitalisation can provide support by facilitating the categorisation, classification and tagging of expenditure items. Italian practices show that accounting can assume a technical role in the process of SDG achievement, but the underlying subjectivity involved does not facilitate the consideration of the social and moral aspects. The solutions used may be acceptable for decision-making at a micro level but may encounter resistance at the macro level due to the social and moral expectations of government budgeting, including the budget’s legal aspects. Originality/value This study taps into the social and moral aspects of management accounting, reminding us of the potential contribution of accounting tools that can be used to provide tangible results. While the limitations of the underlying technicalities are recognised, their application could be more useful ex-ante, integrating the expectations of social and moral practice, rather than looking at information ex-post.",10.1108/MEDAR-03-2024-2410,"Dabbicco, Giovanna; Caruana, Josette; Bisogno, Marco"
Digital innovation strategies in the public sector,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Despite the increasing attention on digital innovations in the private sector, little is known about digital innovation strategies in the public sector. This knowledge gap is growing as public sector employees are increasingly embracing new digital tools and ideas. Drawing on rich qualitative data from practitioners in 25 cities across 18 countries, this study analyzes the digital innovation strategies pursued in the public sector, with specific attention placed on digital orientation and the foci of value creation activities. Extending the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) framework, we identify four distinct digital innovation strategies in the public sector: enhancement-oriented, anticipatory, adaptive, and persistent. Our findings reveal that enhancement-oriented and persistent strategies are the most prevalent, reflecting a strong focus on internal value creation through process optimization and long-term organizational change. In contrast, adaptive and anticipatory strategies are less common. We find a near-equal prevalence of incremental and transformational goals, indicating balanced strategic orientation. Our findings also suggest that practitioners often employ multiple strategies, reflecting the multifacetedness of driving digital innovation in the public sector. We provide valuable insights into various activities linked to the four identified innovation strategies, ending with a comprehensive discussion of our findings, conclusions, study limitations, and future research directions.",10.1016/j.respol.2025.105274,"Guenduez, Ali Asker; Demircioglu, Mehmet Akif; Mueller, Elena Maria; Cinar, Emre"
Assessing data governance models for smart cities: Benchmarking data governance models on the basis of European urban requirements,2025,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.4944879227570169,"Smart cities aim to improve residents’ quality of life by implementing effective services, infrastructure, and processes through information and communication technologies. However, without robust smart city data governance, much of the urban data potential remains underexploited, resulting in inefficiencies and missed opportunities for city administrations. This study addresses these challenges by establishing specific, actionable requirements for smart city data governance models, derived from expert interviews with representatives of 27 European cities. From these interviews, recurring themes emerged, such as the need for standardized data formats, clear data access guidelines, and stronger cross-departmental collaboration mechanisms. These requirements emphasize technology independence, flexibility to adapt across different urban contexts, and promoting a data-driven culture. By benchmarking existing data governance models against these newly established urban requirements, the study uncovers significant variations in their ability to address the complex, dynamic nature of smart city data systems. This study thus enhances the theoretical understanding of data governance in smart cities and provides municipal decision-makers with actionable insights for improving data governance strategies. In doing so, it directly supports the broader goals of sustainable urban development by helping improve the efficiency and effectiveness of smart city initiatives.",10.1016/j.scs.2025.106528,"Bozkurt, Yusuf; Rossmann, Alexander; Pervez, Zeeshan; Ramzan, Naeem"
Does high e-government adoption assure stronger security? Results from a cross-country analysis of Australia and Thailand,2020,-1,Outliers,0.05114480914347236,"We present the first comprehensive audit and comparison of e-government website security in two countries. Australia was selected for its high level of e-government adoption, while Thailand was selected in contrast as a developing nation. Through our audit of 800 pages across 40 websites, we reveal numerous security vulnerabilities suggesting that the high adopters of e-government may not always be providing better protection to their citizens. Alarmingly, the most basic web security measure, the use of Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure encryption was only used in half of Australian and one-third of Thai sites. Our methodology included content analysis of policies and encryption, followed by security vulnerability testing, to provide the first baseline data on these two countries. Statistical analysis suggests that far from being the benchmark for security, Australian e-government sites do not significantly differ from Thai sites in their vulnerability level. The implications of these findings are examined, and recommendations are made for practice. It is hoped that these insights into the current state of security provide a needed stimulus to focus more on the practical information security aspects of e-government.",10.1016/j.giq.2019.101408,"Thompson, Nik; Mullins, Antony; Chongsutakawewong, Thanavit"
From digital to sustainable: A scientometric review of smart city literature between 1990 and 2019,2020,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.18431613051960558,"In recent years, smart city (SC) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry due to a mix of urbanization, informatization, and globalization. Although several literature reviews of SC research have been conducted, there still appears to be a lack of systematic quantitative and visual investigation and multidisciplinary scrutiny of the structure and evolution of this field. This paper conducts a scientometric review of the progressively synthesized network derived from 7840 bibliographic records from a topic search on SC in the period 1990–2019. Using CiteSpace, co-occurrence analysis of categories is conducted to explore the evolution of the disciplines engaged in SC research; co-word analysis of the keywords and document co-citation analysis associated with cluster analysis are further performed to reveal the development paths and research topics in terms of burst terms, text and citation-based clusters, citation structure, and pivotal points in the field. These scientometric techniques are combined to: (1) reveal the intellectual division of this developing field using a visual and comprehensive approach, (2) identify in chronological order the 10 core research sub-topics in this area with burst references and terms, (3) identify Internet of Things, big data, and fog computing as the most promising technologies for SC planning and development, and (4) conclude that smart sustainable cities and sustainable smart cities are the two emerging trends in the domain.

Exploring diverse interests of collaborators in smart cities: A topic analysis using LDA and BERT,2024,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Smart cities have emerged as a promising solution to the problems associated with urbanization. However, research that holistically considers diverse stakeholders in smart cities is scarce. This study utilizes data from four types of collaborators (academia, public sector, industry, and civil society actors) to identify key topics and suggest research areas for developing smart cities. We used latent Dirichlet allocation and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for topic extraction and analysis. The analysis reveals that sustainability and digital platform have received similar levels of interest from academia, industry, and government, whereas governance, resource, and green space are less frequently mentioned than technology-related topics. Hype cycle analysis, which considers public and media expectations, reveals that smart cities experienced rapid growth from 2015 to 2021, but the growth rate has slowed since 2022. This means that a breakthrough improvement in the current situation is required. Accordingly, we propose resolving the unbalanced distribution of topic interests among collaborators, especially in the areas of governance, environment, economy, and healthcare.

Factors influencing the consideration of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) for smart city projects: Evidence from Hong Kong,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.5244553725550739,"Smart cities are emerging in most parts of the world. The cost-benefit analysis of such initiatives should include an unbiased consideration of potential procurement modes, especially when a substantial investment is entailed to scale up projects to the city level. Despite the enticing trend of public private partnerships (PPPs), city governments should evaluate the available options using an objective approach such as Multi-Attribute Utility Analysis (MAUA). The technique takes into account prioritized assessment criteria (which are tailor-made for smart city projects) and the relative utilities of the procurement options in meeting the criteria. The methodology of MAUA is demonstrated through a questionnaire survey and a focus group meeting involving public and private sector practitioners, and applied to 8 types of common smart city projects in Hong Kong, which is one of the metropolises earmarked to become a smart city by putting concepts into practice.

E-participation within the context of e-government initiatives: A comprehensive systematic review,2022,-1,Outliers,0.10929889117214636,"Abstract Context The e-government concept has gained significant interest from academics and practitioners. E-government projects have altered how government institutions communicate, share content, collaborate, and interact with citizens. Nowadays, e-government systems are crucial resources for facilitating government work and interaction with other people and organizations to co-operation with each other. Despite the availability of authentic research studies on the trend of e-government, there is still a need to conduct a comprehensive review and combine findings from earlier studies, as well as to define the current issues surrounding e-participation in the context of e-government initiatives. Objective The main aim of this study is to review the previous literature to explore and understand the issues surrounding e-participation within the context of e-government initiatives, and to what extent these issues impact the success of these initiatives. Method In this study, a systematic review method has been used to gather, analyze, and synthesize data regarding the accuracy and value of previous articles. This method followed a predefined review protocol and used both automated and manual research methods to find all the relevant research papers that were published in digital databases between 2010 and 2020. Results According to the review study, we extracted 211 articles that addressed the key issues that negatively affected the level of e-participation, which were analyzed by following a systematic mapping method that collected significant information to fulfill the research aim. We classified and investigated the published papers that addressed a broad range of topics, including three crucial issues: user acceptance, interaction, and participation. As a result of the weight analysis, computer self-efficacy and perceived ease of use were found to be the best predictors of whether people want to use e-government systems. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and service quality were also found to be promising predictors of satisfaction with e-government services that need more study. Conclusions This systematic review found a high need for more research on this vast topic, as e-participation is critical to e-government performance and is evolving with ICT. Finally, this study will help academics understand current limitations, obstacles, and gaps, as well as future research opportunities in e-participation.",10.1016/j.teler.2022.100015,"Adnan, Mohammed; Ghazali, Masitah; Othman, Nur Zuraifah Syazrah"
An attention-based view of AI assimilation in public sector organizations: The case of Saudi Arabia,2022,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.8437159141489067,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been suggested to have transformative potential for public sector organizations through enabling increased productivity and novel ways to deliver public services. In order to materialize the transformative potential of AI, public sector organizations need to successfully assimilate AI in their operational activities. However, AI assimilation in the public sector appears to be fragmented and lagging the private sector, and the phenomena has really limited attention from academic research community. To address this gap, we adopt the case study approach to explore three Saudi-Arabian public sector organizations and analyze the results using the attention-based view of the organization (ABV) as the theoretical lens. This study elucidates the challenges related AI assimilation in public sector in terms of how organizational attention is focused situated and distributed during the assimilation process. Five key challenges emerged from the cases studied, namely (i) misalignment between AI and management decision-making, (ii) tensions with linguistics and national culture, (iii) developing and implementing AI infrastructure, (iv) data integrity and sharing, and (v) ethical and governance concerns. The findings reveal a re-enforcing relationship between the situated attention and structural distribution of attention that can accelerate the successful assimilation of AI in public sector organizations.",10.1016/j.giq.2021.101617,"Alshahrani, Albandari; Dennehy, Denis; Mäntymäki, Matti"
Towards a privacy impact assessment methodology to support the requirements of the general data protection regulation in a big data analytics context: A systematic literature review,2022,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"Big Data Analytics enables today's businesses and organisations to process and utilise the raw data that is generated on a daily basis. While Big Data Analytics has improved efficiency and created many opportunities, it has also increased the risk of personal data being compromised or breached. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as a means of identifying appropriate controls to mitigate risks associated with the protection of personal data. However, little is currently known about how to conduct such a DPIA in a Big Data Analytics context. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of identifying privacy and data protection risks specific to the Big Data Analytics context that could negatively impact individuals' rights and freedoms when they occur. Based on a sample of 159 articles, we applied a thematic analysis to all identified risks which resulted in the definition of nine Privacy Touch Points that summarise the identified risks. The coverage of these Privacy Touch Points was then analysed for ten Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) methodologies. The insights gained from our analysis will inform the next phase of our research, in which we aim to develop a comprehensive DPIA methodology that will enable data processors and data controllers to identify, analyse and mitigate privacy and data protection risks when storing and processing data involving Big Data Analytics.",10.1016/j.clsr.2021.105640,"Georgiadis, Georgios; Poels, Geert"
Understanding big data and data protection measures in smart city strategies: An analysis of 28 cities,2024,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.28103984464287834,"The Smart City concept aims to improve urban governance and optimize public services, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for citizens. As data generation and processing grow rapidly in volume, velocity, and variety, Smart Cities must integrate secure big data considerations into their strategic frameworks and project implementations. This paper explores how big data and data protection measures are represented in the strategies of 28 cities worldwide. To achieve this, we employed a three-phase research methodology: 1) identifying resources, 2) conducting content analysis, and 3) using the Delphi method. Our findings indicate that only half of the cities explicitly address big data in their strategies, and most lack adequate data protection measures. Additionally, the paper presents a list of recommendations for big data management and data protection, derived from measures found in Smart City strategies and validated by domain experts through the Delphi method. These recommendations aim to enhance understanding of how to effectively incorporate big data and its protection into urban planning and Smart City projects. However, it is important to note that these insights primarily apply to larger urban areas with abundant resources.",10.1016/j.ugj.2024.12.008,"Lnenicka, Martin; Hervert, Petr; Horak, Oldrich"
"Digital technologies, artificial intelligence, and bureaucratic transformation",2022,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.6967055201864469,"Bureaucracies are often criticized for their inflexibility, budget-maximizing wastefulness, and excessive rules and procedures. Rapid advances in technology, including the expansion of digital government, the use of artificial intelligence, and the ability to collect and analyze big data, promise to make public sector organizations leaner, more efficient, and more responsive to citizens' needs. While these technological changes have prompted some observers to forecast the end of bureaucracy, data from many countries show that bureaucratic public organizations are not disappearing. In this article, we argue that this paradox can be explained by revisiting some of the foundational work of sociologist Max Weber, who envisioned public administration itself as a bureaucratic machine. Advanced computing technologies, like artificial intelligence, are reinforcing bureaucratic tendencies in the public sector, not eliminating them. While advances in technology may transform the way public sector organizations operate, they can also serve to strengthen bureaucracy's core purpose.",10.1016/j.futures.2021.102886,"Newman, Joshua; Mintrom, Michael; O'Neill, Deirdre"
Strategic and technological drivers of ambidexterity and sustainability: Impact assessment in UAE project-based public sector organizations,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.3155574093277692,"This research aims to propose a framework for applying ambidexterity in the UAE’s public sector project-based organization. The study uses a quantitative research methodology to survey 400 public sector employees to establish the correlation between organizational culture, leadership, technology, and ambidexterity. The study validates these factors' importance to ambidexterity using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The study reveals that a supportive organizational culture and transformational leadership positively influence ambidextrous capabilities, while technology adoption moderates the impact of leadership and culture on ambidexterity. Furthermore, the findings reinforce the hypotheses that human capital and employee flexibility facilitate ambidextrous strategies, mainly when supported by technology. However, the study identifies factors like organizational silos, resistance to change, and resource scarcity, which are the main barriers to ambidexterity. Therefore, the study contributes to the literature by proposing a context-specific framework for ambidexterity in the UAE’s public sector. It offers valuable insights to policymakers and public sector managers about overcoming the challenges inherent in the ambidexterity process. The validated framework provides tangible guidelines for building ambidexterity, especially regarding technology resources, organizational culture, and leadership.",10.1016/j.jer.2024.11.008,"Leem, Mey Al; Khalil, Khalil Abdelrazek; Ubaid, Alaa M."

Big Data analytics in Agile software development: A systematic mapping study,2021,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,1.0,"Context: Over the last decade, Agile methods have changed the software development process in an unparalleled way and with the increasing popularity of Big Data, optimizing development cycles through data analytics is becoming a commodity. Objective: Although a myriad of research exists on software analytics as well as on Agile software development (ASD) practice on itself, there exists no systematic overview of the research done on ASD from a data analytics perspective. Therefore, the objective of this work is to make progress by linking ASD with Big Data analytics (BDA). Method: As the primary method to find relevant literature on the topic, we performed manual search and snowballing on papers published between 2011 and 2019. Results: In total, 88 primary studies were selected and analyzed. Our results show that BDA is employed throughout the whole ASD lifecycle. The results reveal that data-driven software development is focused on the following areas: code repository analytics, defects/bug fixing, testing, project management analytics, and application usage analytics. Conclusions: As BDA and ASD are fast-developing areas, improving the productivity of software development teams is one of the most important objectives BDA is facing in the industry. This study provides scholars with information about the state of software analytics research and the current trends as well as applications in the business environment. Whereas, thanks to this literature review, practitioners should be able to understand better how to obtain actionable insights from their software artifacts and on which aspects of data analytics to focus when investing in such initiatives.",10.1016/j.infsof.2020.106448,"Biesialska, Katarzyna; Franch, Xavier; Muntés-Mulero, Victor"
An intelligent system for focused crawling from Big Data sources,2021,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.3040664222380993,"Nowadays, the proper management of data is a key business enabler and booster for companies, so as to increase their competitiveness. Typically, companies hold massive amounts of data within their servers, which might include previously offered services, proposals, bids, and so on. They rely on their expert managers to manually analyse them in order to make strategic decisions. However, given the huge amount of information to be analysed and the necessity of making timely decisions, they often exploit a small amount of the available data, which often does not yield effective choices. For instance, this happens in the context of the e-procurement domain, where bids for new calls for tender are often formulated by looking at some past proposals from a company. Driven by an extensive experience on the e-procurement domain, in this paper we propose an intelligent system to support organisations in the focused crawling of artefacts (calls for tender, BIMs, equipment, policies, market trends, and so on) of interest from the web, semantically matching them against internal Big Data and knowledge sources, so as to let companies analysts make better strategic decisions. The novel contribution consists of a proper extension of the K-means algorithm used by a web crawler within the proposed system, and a semantic module exploiting search patterns to find relevant data within the crawled artefacts. The proposed solution has been implemented and extensively assessed in the e-procurement domain. It has been successively extended to other domains, such as robot programming, cloud providing, and several other domains. Since to the best of our knowledge in the literature do not exists similar systems, in order to prove its effectiveness we have compared its crawling component against similar crawlers, by plugging them within our system.",10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115560,"Bifulco, Ida; Cirillo, Stefano; Esposito, Christian; Guadagni, Roberta; Polese, Giuseppe"

This paper focuses on benchmarking of open data initiatives over the years and attempts to identify patterns observed among European countries that could lead to disparities in the development, growth, and sustainability of open data ecosystems. To do this, we studied benchmarks and indices published over the last years (57 editions of 8 artifacts) and conducted a comparative case study of eight European countries, identifying patterns among them considering different potentially relevant contexts such as e-government, open government data, open data indices and rankings, and others relevant for the country under consideration. Using a Delphi method, we reached a consensus within a panel of experts and validated a final list of 94 patterns, including their frequency of occurrence among studied countries and their effects on the respective countries.

A systematic literature review of the smart city transformation process: The role and interaction of stakeholders and technology,2024,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.8191130507179546,"This study describes and analyses the developmental processes of cities that aim to transform into smart cities and outlines the core scenarios within which these developmental processes take place. It concentrates on the role of and interaction between stakeholders and technology in the smart city transformation process. Knowledge and insight into these developmental processes and core scenarios are scarce and necessary, as they can contribute to a possible acceleration and increase in the effectiveness of smart city transformation strategies. As a result of a systematic literature review, this study develops a theoretical framework that describes five stages of smart city transformation as a generic developmental and iterative process with feedback. These stages are (1) smart city goal definition, (2) smart city technology innovation, (3) smart city strategy development, (4) smart city plan implementation, and (5) smart city plan evaluation. Different developments and outcomes of these five stages result in four alternative scenarios for smart city development: (a) spiralling up, (b) downward repetition, (c) corrective feedback, and (d) upward feedback. Academics can use the insights in the five developmental processes and four core scenarios as a general framework to interpret, position, and analyse specific smart city projects and processes. Practitioners can use the insights into these developmental processes and core scenarios to inform their management, steering and governance activities in the smart city processes in which they participate.",10.1016/j.scs.2023.105112,"Dai, Yuxi; Hasanefendic, Sandra; Bossink, Bart"

"Artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data in natural resources management: A comprehensive bibliometric review of literature spanning 1975–2022",2023,-1,Outliers,0.10953729039916692,"Applying artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data to natural resource management (NRM) is revolutionizing how natural resources are managed. To gain more insights into the domain, we use 394 Scopus-indexed documents to explore the thematic evolution and explore future research directions. We found that the topics related to AI, ML, and big data for natural resource management have increased significantly since 2012. While “Remote Sensing” is the most productive journal, S. Alqadhi and J. Mallick are the most contributing authors, and the United States has been the most contributing country. While the keywords “sustainable development” and “remote sensing” have been growing steadily since 1975, “natural resource modeling” and “machine learning” have been more popular during the last few years. The thematic analysis reveals that the existing literature is concentrated around four clusters, and the content analysis of the clusters uncovers 15 future research agendas. These research agendas include the development of efficient strategies for NRM, understanding the role of AI and ML in natural resource management, leveraging data-driven methods for decision-making, and developing models for interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches. The study provides important implications of using technology in NRM. These technologies help policymakers create effective policies, improves assessment and decision-making, and optimizes resource use.

Sustainable AI: An integrated model to guide public sector decision-making,2022,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Ethics, explainability, responsibility, and accountability are important concepts for questioning the societal impacts of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI), but are insufficient to guide the public sector in regulating and implementing AI. Recent frameworks for AI governance help to operationalize these by identifying the processes and layers of governance in which they must be considered, but do not provide public sector workers with guidance on how they should be pursued or understood. This analysis explores how the concept of sustainable AI can help to fill this gap. It does so by reviewing how the concept has been used by the research community and aligning research on sustainable development with research on public sector AI. Doing so identifies the utility of boundary conditions that have been asserted for social sustainability according to the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development, and which are here integrated with prominent concepts from the discourse on AI and society. This results in a conceptual model that integrates five boundary conditions to assist public sector decision-making about how to govern AI: Diversity, Capacity for learning, Capacity for self-organization Common meaning, and Trust. These are presented together with practical approaches for their presentation, and guiding questions to aid public sector workers in making the decisions that are required by other operational frameworks for ethical AI.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101926,"Wilson, Christopher; van der Velden, Maja"
The damage done by big data-driven public relations,2020,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.28221276307545495,"Over the last two decades it has been argued that public relations contributes to hegemony by corporate organizations over stakeholder groups who have less power and resources. In its original formulation, the concept of hegemony had two defining features: firstly, it was conceived of as a society-wide, macroscopic formation and second as self-reinforcing i.e. self-replicating. This article argues that the rise of big-data in public relations is a hegemonic development that further re-enforces the current institutional logics and power in the three main spheres of society: corporate, governance and civic. Using the economic notion of externalities, the authors argue that loss of agency over personal data is the unpriced, unrecognized externality that drives the big-data market. This externality is dependent on those who are the losers of agency not having the requisite information, power or resources to negotiate alternatives that might re-dress the balance. As users and proponents of the use of big data, the public relations profession has a number of key questions to answer if it is not to re-inforce arguments that it is a hegemonizing force in organizations and society. Normal economic remedies to address externalities are not adequate to a case that is both ethical as well as economic in nature. The article therefore concludes with five arguments that the public relations profession should debate to provide leadership within organisations and society.",10.1016/j.pubrev.2020.101902,"Gregory, Anne; Halff, Gregor"

After a few preliminary remarks on Big Data terminology and possible regulatory approaches, Big Data regulation is examined against the EU and the Council of Europe data protection systems. Particular emphasis is given to the Council of Europe regulatory approach both in terms of Convention 108+ and with regard to its Guidelines on Big Data and AI. The authors believe that, because both the EU and the Council of Europe have avoided to refer to Big Data in their basic data protection regulatory texts (a most likely intentional omission), guidance is indeed needed, and it may well come in the form of soft law. The Council of Europe has taken the lead in this through its Guidelines; Their timely, comprehensive and balanced approach showcases the Council's will for such processing to indeed take place, but within a well-regulated environment, albeit not under a rigid regulatory construction.",10.1016/j.clsr.2020.105496,"de Hert, Paul; Papakonstantinou, Vagelis"

Today, Big Data is permeating through the bigger aspect of human life for scientific and commercial dependencies, especially for massive scale data analytics of beyond the exabyte magnitude. As the footprint of Big Data applications is continuously expanding, the reliability on cloud environments is also increasing to obtain appropriate, robust and affordable services to deal with Big Data challenges. Cloud computing avoids any need to locally maintain the overly scaled computing infrastructure that include not only dedicated space, but the expensive hardware and software also. Several data models to process Big Data are already developed and a number of such models are still emerging, potentially relying on heterogeneous underlying storage technologies, including cloud computing.

Big Data and Machine Learning Based Secure Healthcare Framework,2018,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.6544623720675304,"The paper presents a brief introduction to big data and its role in healthcare applications. It is observed that the use of big data architecture and techniques are continuously assisting in managing the expeditious data growth in healthcare industry. Here, initially an empirical study is performed to analyze the role of big data in healthcare industry. It has been observed that significant work has been done using big data in healthcare sector. Nowadays, it is intricate to envision the way the machine learning and big data can influence the healthcare industries. It has been observed that most of the authors who implemented the use of machine learning and big data analytics in disease diagnosis have not given significant weightage to the privacy and security of the data. Here, a novel design of smart and secure healthcare information system using machine learning and advanced security mechanism has been proposed to handle big data of medical industry. The innovation lies in the incorporation of optimal storage and data security layer used to maintain security and privacy. Different techniques like masking encryption, activity monitoring, granular access control, dynamic data encryption and end point validation have been incorporated. The proposed hybrid four layer healthcare model seems to be more effective disease diagnostic big data system.",10.1016/j.procs.2018.05.020,"Kaur, Prableen; Sharma, Manik; Mittal, Mamta"
Big Data and corporate reporting: impacts and paradoxes,2017,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.2823525307652349,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the phenomenon of Big Data and corporate reporting, and to determine the impact of Big Data and the current Big Data state of mind with regard to corporate reporting, what accountant and non-accountant participants’ perceptions are of the phenomenon, what the accountants’ role is and will be in this regard, and what opportunities and risks are associated with Big Data and corporate reporting. Furthermore, this study seeks to identify the inherent technological paradoxes of Big Data and corporate reporting. Design/methodology/approach The current study is qualitative in nature and assumes an interpretive stance, investigating participants’ perceptions of the phenomenon of Big Data and corporate reporting. To this end, interview data from 25 participants, video and text material, were analysed to enhance and triangulate findings. A four-fold sampling strategy was employed to ensure that any collected data would contribute to the findings. Data were analysed on the basis of open and selective coding stages. Data collection and analysis took place in two stages, in 2014 and in 2016. Findings Three topics, or categories, emerged from the data analysis, which have sufficient explanatory power to illustrate the phenomenon of Big Data and corporate reporting, namely the Big Data state of mind and corporate reporting, accountants’ role and future related to Big Data, and perceived opportunities and risks of Big Data. Features of a new approach to corporate reporting were identified and discussed. Furthermore, four paradoxes emerged to express inherent opposing positions of Big Data and corporate reporting, namely empowerment vs enslavement, fulfilling vs creating needs, reliability vs timeliness and simplicity vs complexity. Originality/value The original contribution of the study lies in the empirical investigation of the phenomenon of Big Data and corporate reporting as one of the most recent and praised developments in the accounting context. The dual communication flows of corporate reporting with Big Data is an important element of the findings, which can enhance the prospective financial statements significantly. Finally, technological paradoxes of Big Data and corporate reporting are discussed for the first time, two of which are based on the literature and the remaining two are inherent in the phenomenon of Big Data and corporate reporting.",10.1108/AAAJ-07-2015-2139,"Al-Htaybat, Khaldoon; von Alberti-Alhtaybat, Larissa"
Digital transformation in public-private collaborations: The success of humanitarian supply chain operations,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.6149734182984714,"Recent years have seen the extensive use of big data analytics, related technological infrastructure, and machine learning applications for digital transformation. The resource dependency related to data-driven applications elicits public-private collaborations (PPCs) between governments and private or non-government organizations (NGOs) for value creation. Such collaborations are effective for the success of humanitarian supply chain operations (HSCOs), particularly in the event of large-scale disasters. By building on resource dependence theory (RDT), our study explores the links between digital transformation, PPCs, and HSCO success. Using structural equation modeling on data collected from 224 key decision-makers and experts, we found that digital transformation mediates the relationship between private-NGO collaborations and HSCO success while host government support moderates it. Our study thus makes an original contribution to RDT and the emerging domains of contemporary digital and data-driven applications in HSCO.

A conceptual framework for the government big data ecosystem (‘datagov.eco’),2024,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.25036922548555196,"The public sector, private firms, and civil society constantly create data of high volume, velocity, and veracity from diverse sources. This kind of data is known as big data. As in other industries, public administrations consider big data as the “new oil"" and employ data-centric policies to transform data into knowledge, stimulate good governance, innovative digital services, transparency, and citizens' engagement in public policy. More and more public organizations understand the value created by exploiting internal and external data sources, delivering new capabilities, and fostering collaboration inside and outside of public administrations. Despite the broad interest in this ecosystem, we still lack a detailed and systematic view of it. In this paper, we attempt to describe the emerging Government Big Data Ecosystem as a socio-technical network of people, organizations, processes, technology, infrastructure, standards & policies, procedures, and resources. This ecosystem supports data functions such as data collection, integration, analysis, storage, sharing, use, protection, and archiving. Through these functions, value is created by promoting evidence-based policymaking, modern public services delivery, data-driven administration and open government, and boosting the data economy.

Factors influencing effective use of big data: A research framework,2020,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.2905818056161342,"Information systems (IS) research has explored “effective use” in a variety of contexts. However, it is yet to specifically consider it in the context of the unique characteristics of big data. Yet, organizations have a high appetite for big data, and there is growing evidence that investments in big data solutions do not always lead to the derivation of intended value. Accordingly, there is a need for rigorous academic guidance on what factors enable effective use of big data. With this paper, we aim to guide IS researchers such that the expansion of the body of knowledge on the effective use of big data can proceed in a structured and systematic manner and can subsequently lead to empirically driven guidance for organizations. Namely, with this paper, we cast a wide net to understand and consolidate from literature the potential factors that can influence the effective use of big data, so they may be further studied. To do so, we first conduct a systematic literature review. Our review identifies 41 factors, which we categorize into 7 themes, namely data quality; data privacy and security and governance; perceived organizational benefit; process management; people aspects; systems, tools, and technologies; and organizational aspects. To explore the existence of these themes in practice, we then analyze 45 published case studies that document insights into how specific companies use big data successfully. Finally, we propose a framework for the study of effective use of big data as a basis for future research. Our contributions aim to guide researchers in establishing the relevance and relationships within the identified themes and factors and are a step toward developing a deeper understanding of effective use of big data.",10.1016/j.im.2019.02.001,"Surbakti, Feliks P.

"A review of smart vehicles in smart cities: Dangers, impacts, and the threat landscape",2025,-1,Outliers,0.3259476402419534,"The humble, mechanical automobile has gradually evolved into our modern connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs)—also known as “smart vehicles.” Similarly, our cities are gradually developing into “smart cities,” where municipal services from transportation networks to utilities to recycling to law enforcement are integrated. The idea, with both smart vehicles and smart cities, is that more data leads to better, more informed decisions. Smart vehicles and smart cities would acquire data from their own equipment (e.g., cameras, sensors) and from their connections—e.g., connections to fellow smart vehicles, to road-side infrastructure, to smart transportation systems (STSs), etc. Unfortunately, the paradigm of smart vehicles in smart cities is rife with danger and ripe for misuse. One vulnerable system or service could become an attacker's entry point, facilitating access to every connected vehicle, device, etc. Worse, smart vehicles and smart cities are inherently cyber-physical; a cyberattack can have physical consequences, including destruction of infrastructure and loss of life. Lastly, to leverage all the benefits of smart vehicles in smart cities, we would need to accept exorbitant levels of data collection and surveillance, which, in the absence of ironclad privacy protections, could lead to total lack of privacy. In this work, we define the automotive context—i.e., smart vehicles—within the larger context of smart cities as our threat landscape. Then, we enumerate and describe all of the (1) threats, (2) attack surfaces & targets, (3) areas of concern (indirect vulnerabilities & threats), and (4) impacts of smart vehicles in smart cities. Our objective is to demonstrate that the dangers are real and imminent—in the hope that they will be addressed before an attack on the “smart vehicles in smart cities” paradigm results in loss of life.",10.1016/j.vehcom.2024.100871,"Kidmose, Brooke"

Factors impacting employee productivity in the UAE public sector embracing the Fourth Industrial Revolution,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.4122229774765427,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is rapidly transforming the nature of work, service delivery, and performance expectations in public sector institutions. These digital disruptions have raised critical questions about how employee productivity can be sustained amid evolving technologies and organizational structures. In this context, understanding the influence of human resource management (HRM), workforce capacity (WFC), and people leadership (PL) becomes essential for enhancing public sector performance. Grounded in socio-technical systems (STS) theory, this study proposes an integrated framework to address productivity challenges unique to the UAE context. A cross-sectional survey of 303 public-sector employees in Sharjah was conducted, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, inferential tests, and the relative importance index (RII) technique. The findings reveal that HRM, WFC, and PL significantly affect four key outcomes: productivity, quality of work life, distributive fairness (DF), and work-from-home arrangements (WHA). Notably, the most influential factor across all domains was a positive work environment (RII = 0.902), followed by job security (RII = 0.894) and supervisory behavior (RII = 0.889).

The political context of public sector innovation: A critical interpretive synthesis on Ukraine,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7172985813952729,"Innovation often sparks power struggles, redistributes resources, and challenges entrenched institutional legacies. Yet the role of power dynamics embedded in political contexts, particularly in non-Western countries, in shaping public sector innovation (PSI) has remained underexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining how power dynamics at multiple levels and critical junctures have shaped PSI trajectories over time in Ukraine. Drawing on historical institutionalism and using a context-specific critical interpretive synthesis of 84 studies from 1991 to 2022, we reveal how critical junctures intensified PSI and enabled new innovation priorities. However, these moments were deeply conditioned by existing power dynamics across international, national and subnational political levels. While some innovations contributed to the redistribution of power, others were stalled or fragmented owing to path dependencies. This study makes two primary theoretical contributions: first, it reconceptualizes political context as a dynamic, multilevel arena of vertical and horizontal power contestations that shapes PSI; second, it extends PSI theory by demonstrating how critical junctures operate as temporally bounded periods of constrained agency, cumulatively shaping innovation trajectories. These insights advance our understanding of the complex interplays between political contexts, power dynamics, and temporality in PSI.",10.1016/j.respol.2025.105322,"Cinar, Emre; Prodius, Oksana; Sokoly, Ivan; Ozcan, Sercan; Guenduez, Ali Asker"

Citing a broad range of literature, the paper carefully defines meaningfulness and co-creation in the context of long-term social and healthcare services and using a Vygotskian approach to social learning, it provides evidence of how context influences perceptions of successful change and of meaningfulness. In doing so, the paper suggests that the context for these digitalised services is best viewed from: (a) the stakeholder ecosystem, (b) the service context and (c) the service delivery framework. While most research on digitalized health and social care services focuses solely on the success or failure of the service, this paper adds to the body of knowledge around the impact of the meaningfulness of work for the professionals involved. The paper concludes with recommendations for influencing meaningfulness in relation to digital co-creation platforms in public sector health and social care services.",10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122663,"Kuoppakangas, Päivikki; Stenvall, Jari; Kinder, Tony; Lindfors, Juha; Talonen, Antti"
"An exploration of agile government in the public sector: A systematic literature review at macro, meso, and micro levels of analysis",2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7963272561702501,"Originating from private sector software development, agile has permeated the public sector, fostering innovative reforms not just in project management but also in organizational management and collaborative governance. Despite its widespread adoption, there exists a paucity of research delving into the intricacies of agile practices, particularly for the potential conflicts and interactions with the traditional waterfall-based approaches. Employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method, this systematic review aims to address three fundamental research questions concerning the conceptualization, implementation, and impacts of agile government. To deepen theoretical insight and practical application, our study classifies agile into three distinct levels: Micro (project management), Meso (organizational management), and Macro (governance structure). Our analysis uncovers substantial variations in agile practices across these levels, reflecting a deliberate strategy aimed at harmonizing with existing bureaucratic systems. This study concludes by offering policy implications and delineating avenues for future research endeavors.",10.1016/j.giq.2025.102082,"Tai, Kuang-Ting; Awasthi, Pallavi"
Inclusive smart cities? Technology-driven urban development and disabilities,2024,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.38469336150138106,"The concept of smart cities refers to urban areas that utilize (digital) technologies to enhance urban operations, services, and the quality of life of their residents. However, people have varying possibilities and capabilities for using (digital) technologies. This intertwines the technology-driven urban development with the ideal of inclusiveness (or the lack thereof) as it seems unrealistic to assume that smart cities would benefit equally the whole society. This controversy is approached by questioning whether smart cities can really improve the living conditions of the disadvantaged via reviewing the literature that ties technology-driven urban development to persons with disabilities. The study shows, first, that disabilities are rarely discussed in the extant literature on smart cities particularly from a critical perspective. Second, it is underlined here, based on the reviewed literature, that while smart city initiatives hold promise for enhancing urban living conditions of persons with disabilities, they are not one-size-fits-all answers to tackle the marginalization of persons with disabilities. Rather, since technological solutions do not counter the fundamental barriers of exclusion, urban technologies still need advanced ideas in establishing a truly inclusive smart city.",10.1016/j.cities.2024.105334,"Makkonen, Teemu; Inkinen, Tommi"
The role of dynamic managerial capabilities and organizational readiness in smart city transformation,2022,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"This study focuses on the dynamic managerial capabilities of smart city managers and the organizational readiness of a city administration required to drive smart city transformation. After reviewing the literature, we conducted semi-structured interviews with smart city managers in 40 smart cities. We identified five dynamic capabilities that effectively contribute to smart city transformation: seizing, sensing, innovation, integrative, and empowering capability. Our analysis also reveals that a city administration's organizational readiness plays a critical role in these transformative processes and relies on four factors: innovation readiness, resource readiness, a participatory and collective mindset, and strategic readiness. Based on our findings, we suggest a theoretical framework composed of 10 propositions that describe the mutual influences of these dynamic managerial capabilities and organizational readiness factors, together with their contributions to smart city transformation.

Dashboards can be used by governments to support their decision-making and policy processes or to communicate and interact with the public. The objective of this paper is to understand and to support the design of dashboards for creating transparency and accountability. Two smart city cases are investigated showing that dashboards can improve transparency and accountability, however, realizing these benefits was cumbersome and encountered various risks and challenges. Challenges include insufficient data quality, lack of understanding of data, poor analysis, wrong interpretation, confusion about the outcomes, and imposing a pre-defined view. These challenges can easily result in misconceptions, wrong decision-making, creating a blurred picture resulting in less transparency and accountability, and ultimately in even less trust in the government. Principles guiding the design of dashboards are presented.

This study aimed to review current data on digital transformation in the agriculture field of Morocco. We presented a literature review on digital technologies and agriculture in Morocco from 1990 to 2025. We used related keywords, and data was recorded from databases, governmental sites, and published documents. The results obtained showed that in Morocco, digital transformation was adopted in the last decade of the 21st century, with applications in different fields, including education, finance, health, administration, etc. Various digital technologies have been implemented in agriculture, including Big Data Analytics (BDA), Blockchain, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Deep Learning (DL), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), Machine Learning (ML), Cloud Computing (CC), Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies have addressed different fields, including production, farming, logistics, marketing, export, and improved services, visibility, tracking of products, and commercialization. In Morocco, any endeavours by relevant authorities or stakeholders to promote and develop automated agriculture through the integration of new technologies have much ground to make up compared to the top spots in the sector. As a result, we suggested areas that need more improvement in terms of research,  farmer awareness, and activities. This study summarizes for the first time data concerning digital transformation in agriculture and suggests it as a reference for future research and to farmers and cooperatives in Morocco.",10.1016/j.atech.2025.100978,"Fakhraddine, Mohammed; Zerrad, Najib; Berhili, Hicham; Morchid, Meryeme"

Factors Driving Citizen Engagement With Government TikTok Accounts During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Model Development and Analysis,2021,-1,Outliers,0.2449759875120791,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, growth in citizen engagement with social media platforms has enabled public health departments to accelerate and improve health information dissemination, developing transparency and trust between governments and citizens. In light of these benefits, it is imperative to learn the antecedents and underlying mechanisms for this to maintain and enhance engagement. Objective The aim of this study is to determine the factors and influencing mechanisms related to citizen engagement with the TikTok account of the National Health Commission of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using a web crawler, 355 short videos were collected from the Healthy China account on TikTok (with more than 3 million followers throughout China), covering the period from January 21, 2020, to April 25, 2020. The title and video length, as well as the number of likes, shares, and comments were collected for each video. After classifying them using content analysis, a series of negative binomial regression analyses were completed. Results Among the 355 videos, 154 (43.4%) related to guidance for clinicians, patients, and ordinary citizens, followed by information concerning the government’s handling of the pandemic (n=100, 28.2%), the latest news about COVID-19 (n=61, 17.2%), and appreciation toward frontline emergency services (n=40, 11.3%). Video length, titles, dialogic loop, and content type all influenced the level of citizen engagement. Specifically, video length was negatively associated with the number of likes (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.19, P<.001) and comments (IRR=0.39, P<.001). Title length was positively related to the number of shares (IRR=24.25, P=.01), likes (IRR=8.50, P=.03), and comments (IRR=7.85, P=.02). Dialogic loop negatively predicted the number of shares (IRR=0.56, P=.03). In comparison to appreciative information, information about the government’s handling of the situation (IRR=5.16, P<.001) and guidelines information (IRR=7.31, P<.001) were positively correlated with the number of shares, while the latest news was negatively related to the number of likes received (IRR=0.46, P=.004). More importantly, the relationship between predictors and citizen engagement was moderated by the emotional valence of video titles. Longer videos with positive titles received a higher number of likes (IRR=21.72, P=.04) and comments (IRR=10.14, P=.047). Furthermore, for short videos related to government handling of the pandemic (IRR=14.48, P=.04) and guidance for stakeholders (IRR=7.59, P=.04), positive titles received a greater number of shares. Videos related to the latest news (IRR=66.69, P=.04) received more likes if the video title displayed higher levels of positive emotion. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, videos were frequently published on government social media platforms. Video length, title, dialogic loop, and content type significantly influenced the level of citizen engagement. These relationships were moderated by the emotional valence of the video’s title. Our findings have implications for maintaining and enhancing citizen engagement via government social media.",10.2196/21463,"Chen, Qiang; Min, Chen; Zhang, Wei; Ma, Xiaoyue; Evans, Richard"

Digital government and the circular economy transition: An analytical framework and a research agenda,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.6407538566704958,"The transition from a linear economy towards a circular economy (CE), based on reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products, is one of the key priorities in pursuing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where governments play a fundamental role, with the support of digital technologies. Despite the increasing global policy focus on CE, research on the role of digital government in initiating, implementing, and consolidating a transition towards a circular economy is surprisingly scarce and fragmented, and a systematic effort in digital government research is yet to emerge. To tackle this issue, this article sets out to answer the research question: what is the role of digital government in the transition towards a circular economy? Driven by this research question, we conduct a review on 88 empirical studies in the Information Systems (IS) and digital government fields and discuss existing research foci and gaps in relation to the types of digital technologies used, the types of stakeholders involved, the stages of the product life cycle, and the type of resources that governments draw on to advance the circular economy transition. In addition, we identify two types of transition styles, based on an analysis of the types of roles taken by the government in two cases of transition towards a circular economy. Based on these findings, we provide two contributions to establishing a new line of research in digital government and the circular economy: an analytical framework, including a static view, a longitudinal view, and a transition style view of the role of digital government in the circular economy transition; and a research agenda that builds on our framework, to guide future research on the role of digital government in the circular economy transition.",10.1016/j.giq.2023.101904,"Medaglia, Rony; Rukanova, Boriana; Zhang, Ziyan"

However, there is a lack of understanding of the competency requirements to foster leadership capacity for digital innovation with social coherence and responsibility. Based on a socio-technical perspective, this paper presents a multi- and inter-disciplinary framework to identify and evaluate the competencies necessary for leading digital innovation in the built environment. The framework incorporates three dimensions: digital and technical, governance and management, and ethical and responsible innovation. A review of existing competency frameworks for digitalisation in the urban built environment is presented to identify competency gaps across the three dimensions. The results show that existing frameworks rarely strive for comprehensiveness and are limited in their scope to certain competencies along a single dimension. In addition, studies addressing the need for multi- and inter-disciplinary competencies across the three dimensions are lacking. The paper thus demonstrates that our three-pronged framework is a useful and much needed tool to identify competency requirements for local public, private and community stakeholders to steer place-based digital innovation and ensure public value creation.",10.1016/j.jum.2023.01.004,"Bastidas, Viviana; Oti-Sarpong, Kwadwo; Nochta, Timea; Wan, Li; Tang, Junqing; Schooling, Jennifer"

Compared to the German citizens surveyed, the UK citizens displayed greater concerns about disclosing personal data online. Despite some differences, however, findings across both samples indicate a common lack of understanding of the two concepts DP and DS. The resulting citizen concept of DP and DS can help to mediate between politics, technology and the public in the discourse of e-government initiatives and the requirements for DP and DS. We argue that citizens’ understanding of DP and DS is a prerequisite for governments to adequately address citizens’ concerns regarding e-government initiatives.",10.1016/j.chb.2021.106830,"Pleger, Lyn E.; Guirguis, Katharina; Mertes, Alexander"

Those include but are not limited to, increasing economic efficiency, reducing cost and decreasing environmental output. However, the smart city itself is still in its infancy. As it heavily relies on technologies, it opens up doors to cyber attackers and criminals, which can lead to significant losses. An outstanding problem concerns the social and organisational aspects of smart cities security resulting from competing interests of different parties, high levels of interdependence, and social and political complexity. Our review shows that current standards and guidelines have not clearly defined roles and responsibilities of different parties. A common understanding of key security requirements is not shared between different parties. This research assessed the smart cities and their cyber security measures, with a particular focus on technical standards and the regulatory framework. It comprehensively reviewed 93 security standards and guidance. It then performed a comparative case study of Barcelona, Singapore and London smart cities on their governance models, security measures, technical standards and third party management.

Mapping the landscape of government data breaches: A bibliometric analysis of literature from 2006 to 2023,2025,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.42047731021494666,"Data breaches in the government sector are severe threats to cybersecurity and illegal acts that flagrantly violate security and privacy laws. It undermines public trust in government data management. Unlike breaches in other sectors, these incidents can have far-reaching consequences and the potential to cause significant damage to governance and national security. This field has experienced rapid growth in recent years, which means an increase in urgency to address this challenge. This study conducted a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the scientific landscape of government data breaches. It analysed 107 articles published from 2006 to 2023 from the Scopus database. The key findings highlighted trends in scientific production, the most cited articles, country contributions, co-occurrence networks, thematic evolution, and factorial analysis. Ransomware has become one of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity, especially for governments. The use of increasingly sophisticated zero-day attack techniques makes it difficult for law enforcement to track the digital footprints of perpetrators. The regulations on data protection remain inadequate and require improvement. The existing legal framework is not strong enough to reduce data breaches in cyberspace. Therefore, to deal with cyber threats, such as ransomware, cyber risk management is essential and using cloud computing raises new challenges and opportunities in cybersecurity. These findings contribute to future research and practice as guidance for policymakers, system developers, researchers, and practitioners in improving cybersecurity protocols and shaping government regulations and policies.",10.1016/j.ssaho.2024.101234,"Hamid, Supardi; Huda, Mohammad Nurul"
Digital transformation toward AI-augmented public administration: The perception of government employees and the willingness to use AI in government,2022,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Government employees play a critical role in adopting and using new technologies in government, and their attitude and willingness to use them matter in creating a sustainable and meaningful digital transformation. This study explores how the perception of government employees shapes the willingness to support the use of AI technologies in government. Based on a survey data on current government employees in the U.S., our analysis reveals that the willingness to implement and use AI technologies in government was contingent upon a series of positive and negative perceptions about the new technologies, long-term outlook on the role of AI technologies in society, and the familiarity and experience in using some form of AI applications in the past. In particular, the perception of AI enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the work and a positive and longer-term outlook on AI's future about human labor (as an assistant or a competitor), the perception of the technology's ultimate harm or benefit (does it harm or benefit humanity), its ability to eventually make ethical and moral judgments influenced the willingness to support AI technologies in government. A substantial proportion of the government employees in the survey sample responded that they had experienced using some form of AI applications in their work and this familiarity had a strong positive influence on their support for AI. Our findings point to the importance of training the government employees in AI technologies to improve their understanding and perception about the new technologies as well as their potentials in government that will foster a culture of innovation toward sustainable and impactful digital transformation.",10.1016/j.giq.2021.101664,"Ahn, Michael J.; Chen, Yu-Che"

Whether AI adoption challenges matter for public managers? The case of Polish cities,2023,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"A growing body of literature shows that despite the significant benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), its adoption has many unknowns and challenges. However, theoretical studies dominate this topic. Completing the recent works, this article aims to identify challenges faced by public organizations when adopting AI based on the PRISMA Framework and an empirical assessment of these challenges in the opinion of public managers using survey research. The adopted research procedure is also an added value because it could be replicated in other context scenarios. To achieve this paper's aim, the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and survey research among authorities in 414 Polish cities were carried out. As a result, a list of 15 challenges and preventive activities proposed by researchers to prevent these challenges have been identified. Empirical verification of identified challenges allows us to determine which of them limit AI adoption to the greatest extent in public managers' opinion. These include a lack of strategy or plans to initial adoption / continued usage of AI; no ensuring that AI is used in line with human values; employees' insufficient knowledge of how to use AI; insufficient AI policies, laws, and regulations; and different expectations of stakeholders and partners about AI.

This study examined visibility of records management work and RM professionals in Finnish municipal organizations. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire. The theoretical framework of invisible work was tool in analysis. The findings show that records management and RM professionals in Finnish municipalities are invisible when looked through the factors that previous studies have shown to be related invisible work. RM profession in Finnish municipal organizations is strongly fragmented and gendered and the work is done in informal structures sometimes by temporary personnel.

Unleashing the convergence amid digitalization and sustainability towards pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): A holistic review,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.43805109763194605,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the United Nations 2030 Agenda emerged in 2015, becoming an unprecedented global compass for navigating extant sustainability challenges. Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required. Reframing the Agenda, while aligning the sustainable development and digitalization policies, seems advisable to ensure a holistic sustainability. The findings aim at guiding and stimulating further research and science-policy dialogue on the promising nexus amid the SDGs and digitalization.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122204,"Del Río Castro, Gema; González Fernández, María Camino; Uruburu Colsa, Ángel"
Potential pitfalls of smart city development: A study on parking mobile applications (apps) in Hong Kong,2018,-1,Outliers,0.20228352922862247,"Smart cities are built upon information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enable a broad range of advanced services. Through a comprehensive literature review, this study identified four pitfalls brought by the pervasive application of ICT, including information insecurity, privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Therefore, a questionnaire survey together with 27 interviews was conducted in Hong Kong to investigate how the public perceived these pitfalls within the context of mobile apps providing real-time parking information which form a major part of smart mobility. System insecurity and privacy leakage were found to arouse worries among the app-users while their awareness of protecting personal data was found to have room for improvement. Islands of real-time parking information occur as a result of the lack of collaboration among private carpark operators. Digital divide existed widely among the disadvantaged groups and the problem cannot be solved by mere provision of ICT facilities. Overall, technologies alone cannot make a city smart or smarter.

An ecosystem perspective on developing data collaboratives for addressing societal issues: The role of conveners,2023,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.1825358168720797,"With the open and big data movement in full swing, data sharing becomes more ubiquitous and more often crosses sectoral boundaries. The promise of data to help address societal issues and foster innovation requires public organizations to work together with businesses and researchers. Data collaboratives whereby actors collaborate to share and use data for public good gain increasing interest. Most of these collaborations, however, tend to be one-off, small, and limited in impact due to a complex web of legal, technical, ethical, commercial, and organizational challenges. Initiators of data collaboratives, termed as conveners, can potentially alleviate some of these concerns by playing various roles in developing a more sustainable data ecosystem for the data collaboratives. Our study investigates what convener roles are perceived to be critical in developing data collaboratives. By drawing on data ecosystems thinking, we developed a framework of convener roles and sub-roles which we further used to analyze four cases in the Netherlands and Sweden. We conclude that connecting role and learning catalyst role are critical at the initiation stage, while stimulating and mediating roles emerge as future critical roles as the data ecosystem develops. We further identified convener meta-roles that are associated with particular data ecosystem structures (keystone-centric, marketplace-based, intermediary-based, and platform-centric). Our research can be instrumental to actors leading the efforts of creating such data ecosystems as it provides insights on the needs and resources that can be leveraged to stimulate development and innovation.",10.1016/j.giq.2022.101763,"Susha, Iryna; van den Broek, Tijs; van Veenstra, Anne-Fleur; Linåker, Johan"

The social imaginaries on governance through data: Q-methodological analysis of data professionals' views in the field of mobility,2023,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.1252248248225041,"This study strives to contribute to the discussions on the increasing use of data in organisational settings within specific contexts like governance and control of spatial mobilities. Whereas legal, regulatory, and technical aspects are widely studied, there is less knowledge about public discourses on data, especially the data professionals' interpretations (re)constructing these understandings. This study conducted Q-methodological interviews among data professionals employed in the mobility domain in Estonia—a leading digital society—who work in public, private, and third-sector organisations. The findings show the emergence of four discourses on data: (I) data-based liberal internationalism and equal access; (II) integrative data activities through cooperation and disciplinary continuity; (III) (big)data self-reflections and organisational data culture; and (IV) data discrimination aware data practices and privacy protection. Thus, governance through data does not constitute a single imaginary future but creates various scenarios across the types of both data and mobility and the sector. We propose that governance through data emerges in these discourses not only as ‘enculturation’, where data are seen as an ultimate medium of knowledge, but as ‘acculturation’—critically self-reflexive learning through data as a form of change in organisations and among data professionals.",10.1016/j.futures.2023.103199,"Masso, Anu; Männiste, Maris; Calzati, Stefano"

"Tourism research after the COVID-19 outbreak: Insights for more sustainable, local and smart cities",2021,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7087826996249806,"This paper presents the results of a bibliometric analysis of academic research dealing with COVID-19 in the area of city destination development from 1 December 2019 to 31 March 2021. Particularly, by means of SciMAT software, it identifies, quantifies, and visually displays the main research clusters, thematic structure and emerging trends that city and tourism planners will face in the new normal. The search revealed that social media and smart tourism are the themes with the greatest potential; sustainable cities, local destination development, changes in tourist behavior, and tourists’ risk perception are underdeveloped streams with enormous relevance and growth in the new normal. Research on the effects of COVID-19 on citizen health and its economic impact on the tourism industry and cities are intersectional and highly developed topics, although of little relevance. The current study also identifies the challenges of destination research for planners and proposes future research directions. Consequently, this paper contributes to the existing literature on COVID-19 and sustainable cities, as it develops a critical examination of the extant research and points out the research gaps that must be filled by future studies.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103126,"Casado-Aranda, Luis-Alberto; Sánchez-Fernández, Juan; Bastidas-Manzano, Ana-Belén"
Potential pitfalls in the development of smart cities and mitigation measures: An exploratory study,2019,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.3117700460790676,"The rapid proliferation of smart city (SC) projects is a response to the challenges posed by rapid urbanization such as energy shortage, economic reconstruction (the drive towards higher productivity and efficiency) and demographic increase. Ubiquitous information communication technologies (ICTs) in SCs enable people to understand and manage cities more efficiently and sustainably, thus improving their life quality. However, a number of potential pitfalls have been noted in the development of SC. This study aims at identifying potential pitfalls in the development of SCs and filling a knowledge gap in this domain. Based on an extensive literature review, four major pitfalls are categorized as system information insecurity, personal privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Possible causes and adverse effects of these pitfalls are discussed with the aid of three international case reviews. In addition, this study looks into existing assessment schemes of SC performance that are mainly focused on the positive and functional capability, but sparingly evaluate the possible downsides. It is argued that a SC cannot claim to be successful by solely measuring how much it has done or what it aims to achieve. While most studies focus on the benefits of SCs, this research reveals the challenges facing city planners. It contributes to the body of knowledge in this regard and also provides an insight into the subject matter. A framework for conducting further research on mitigating potential SC pitfalls has been laid. It is intended to inform practitioners, researchers and policymakers to develop proactive solutions concerning both technological and non-technological aspects at an early stage of SC developments.",10.1016/j.cities.2018.11.014,"Lam, Patrick T.I.; Ma, Ruiqu"
Strategically constructed narratives on artificial intelligence: What stories are told in governmental artificial intelligence policies?,2023,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"What stories are told in national artificial intelligence (AI) policies? Combining the novel technique of structural topic modeling (STM) and qualitative narrative analysis, this paper examines the policy narratives in 33 countries’ AI policies. We uncover six common narratives that are dominating the political agenda concerning AI. Our findings show that the policy narratives' saliences vary across time and countries. We make several contributions. First, our narratives describe well-grounded, supportable conceptions of AI among governments, and show that AI is still a fairly novel, multilayered, and controversial phenomenon. Building on the premise that human sensemaking is best represented and supported by narration, we address the applied rhetoric of governments to either minimize the risks or exalt the opportunities of AI. Second, we uncover the four prominent roles governments seek  to take concerning AI implementation: enabler, leader, regulator, and/or user. Third, we make a methodological contribution toward data-driven, computationally-intensive theory development. Our methodological approach and the identified narratives present key starting points for further research.",10.1016/j.giq.2022.101719,"Guenduez, Ali A.; Mettler, Tobias"
The Digital Government Reference Library (DGRL) and its potential formative impact on Digital Government Research (DGR),2021,-1,Outliers,0.0851211287773368,"The domain of Digital Government Research (DGR) emerged at the end of the 1990s at the intersection of several traditional academic disciplines such as information studies, information systems research, public administration studies, political science, computer science, and business administration among others. While due to their own boundary definitions none of these traditional disciplines could claim “ownership” to the emerging domain, the disciplines were jointly indispensable to provide their various perspectives. As a consequence, the study domain has evolved as a multi-disciplinary endeavor increasingly fostering interdisciplinary relationships. An important contributor to forming the Digital Government research domain in this way also appears to be attributable to the impact of the Digital Government Reference Library (DGRL), which has regularly recorded, updated, and published bibliographical references to the vast majority of peer-reviewed DG research published in the English language for over a decade and a half. Besides its original curatorial purpose of findability and ease of bibliographic organization of DGR-focused research, over the years the DGRL has increasingly also been used for the purpose of bibliometric studies of some kind and some range. This review captures and analyzes the resulting increasingly formative role of the DGRL in DGR, and it documents its increased uses.",10.1016/j.giq.2021.101613,"Scholl, Hans J."

Remote patient healthcare monitoring, in particular, benefits society as it unburdens hospitals and helps patients with chronic diseases. Analyzing the health status with IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is new in the digital community. The literature yet presents a limited number of references explicitly concerning the topic of qualified data acquisition. In this sense, the present literature review aims to update the joint subject of IoT and vital signs, seeking to understand the state-of-the-art and future directions. We have analyzed 78 articles and IoT manufacturer websites that address vital signs collection to answer a group of primary and specific questions. In particular, we revisited architectures, communication protocols, data acquisition mechanisms, evaluation metrics, and how to efficiently transfer data through the lens of sensors, actuators, and healthcare. Currently, two themes are considered as promising directions for studies in the joint area of IoT and vital sign-based healthcare monitoring. The first is the connection promotion between third-party applications and IoT devices to collect and process time-critical data with the support of edge, fog, and cloud infrastructures. The second theme again brings the focus to data compression methodologies since monitoring vital signs in a smart city geographical area naturally requires strategies to optimize network bandwidth consumption and data storage on computational resources.

Enhancing transparency through open government data: the case of data portals and their features and capabilities,2021,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.186485760024565,"Purpose The purpose of this paper was to draw on evidence from computer-mediated transparency and examine the argument that open government data and national data infrastructures represented by open data portals can help in enhancing transparency by providing various relevant features and capabilities for stakeholders' interactions. Design/methodology/approach The developed methodology consisted of a two-step strategy to investigate research questions. First, a web content analysis was conducted to identify the most common features and capabilities provided by existing national open data portals. The second step involved performing the Delphi process by surveying domain experts to measure the diversity of their opinions on this topic. Findings Identified features and capabilities were classified into categories and ranked according to their importance. By formalizing these feature-related transparency mechanisms through which stakeholders work with data sets we provided recommendations on how to incorporate them into designing and developing open data portals. Social implications The creation of appropriate open data portals aims to fulfil the principles of open government and enables stakeholders to effectively engage in the policy and decision-making processes.

Implications of the use of artificial intelligence in public governance: A systematic literature review and a research agenda,2021,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"To lay the foundation for the special issue that this research article introduces, we present 1) a systematic review of existing literature on the implications of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public governance and 2) develop a research agenda. First, an assessment based on 26 articles on this topic reveals much exploratory, conceptual, qualitative, and practice-driven research in studies reflecting the increasing complexities of using AI in government – and the resulting implications, opportunities, and risks thereof for public governance. Second, based on both the literature review and the analysis of articles included in this special issue, we propose a research agenda comprising eight process-related recommendations and seven content-related recommendations. Process-wise, future research on the implications of the use of AI for public governance should move towards more public sector-focused, empirical, multidisciplinary, and explanatory research while focusing more on specific forms of AI rather than AI in general. Content-wise, our research agenda calls for the development of solid, multidisciplinary, theoretical foundations for the use of AI for public governance, as well as investigations of effective implementation, engagement, and communication plans for government strategies on AI use in the public sector. Finally, the research agenda calls for research into managing the risks of AI use in the public sector, governance modes possible for AI use in the public sector, performance and impact measurement of AI use in government, and impact evaluation of scaling-up AI usage in the public sector.",10.1016/j.giq.2021.101577,"Zuiderwijk, Anneke; Chen, Yu-Che; Salem, Fadi"
Assessing behavioral data science privacy issues in government artificial intelligence deployment,2022,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,0.3512337260852587,"In today's global culture where the Internet has established itself as the main tool for communication and commerce, the capability to massively analyze and predict citizens' behavior has become a priority for governments in terms of collective intelligence and security. At the same time, in the context of novel possibilities that artificial intelligence (AI) brings to governments in terms of understanding and developing collective behavior analysis, important concerns related to citizens' privacy have emerged. In order to identify the main uses that governments make of AI and to define citizens' concerns about their privacy, in the present study, we undertook a systematic review of the literature, conducted in-depth interviews, and applied data-mining techniques. Based on our results, we classified and discussed the risks to citizens' privacy according to the types of AI strategies used by governments that may affect collective behavior and cause massive behavior modification. Our results revealed 11 uses of AI strategies used by the government to improve their interaction with citizens, organizations in cities, services provided by public institutions or the economy, among other areas. In relation to citizens' privacy when AI is used by governments, we identified 8 topics related to human behavior predictions, intelligence decision making, decision automation, digital surveillance, data privacy law and regulation, and the risk of behavior modification. The paper concludes with a discussion of the development of regulations focused on the ethical design of citizen data collection, where implications for governments are presented aimed at regulating security, ethics, and data privacy.

Defining the big social data paradigm through a systematic literature review approach,2021,-1,Outliers,0.09967028660465002,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the Big Social Data (BSD) paradigm, which still lacks a clear and shared definition, and causes a lack of clarity and understanding about its beneficial opportunities for practitioners. In the knowledge management (KM) domain, a clear characterization of the BSD paradigm can lead to more effective and efficient KM strategies, processes and systems that leverage a huge amount of structured and unstructured data sources. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology based on a mixed analysis approach (unsupervised machine learning and human-based) applied to 199 research articles on BSD topics extracted from Scopus and Web of Science. In particular, machine learning processing has been implemented by using topic extraction and hierarchical clustering techniques. Findings The paper provides a threefold contribution: a conceptualization and a consensual definition of the BSD paradigm through the identification of four key conceptual pillars (i.e. sources, properties, technology and value exploitation); a characterization of the taxonomy of BSD data type that extends previous works on this topic; a research agenda for future research studies on BSD and its applications along with a KM perspective. Research limitations/implications The main limits of the research rely on the list of articles considered for the literature review that could be enlarged by considering further sources (in addition to Scopus and Web of Science) and/or further languages (in addition to English) and/or further years (the review considers papers published until 2018). Research implications concern the development of a research agenda organized along with five thematic issues, which can feed future research to deepen the paradigm of BSD and explore linkages with the KM field. Practical implications Practical implications concern the usage of the proposed definition of BSD to purposefully design applications and services based on BSD in knowledge-intensive domains to generate value for citizens, individuals, companies and territories. Originality/value The original contribution concerns the definition of the big data social paradigm built through an SLR the combines machine learning processing and human-based processing.

Learning from winning firms: Government innovation procurement and peer innovation efficiency,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.5338828868124504,"Governments are major purchasers of goods and services globally. Although previous research highlights the role of government procurement in shaping business activities, the spillover effects on peer firms' innovation efficiency remain unexplored. Through a textual analysis that distinguishes innovation procurement from general government purchases, this study investigates the effects and underlying mechanisms of government innovation procurement on the innovation efficiency of peer firms. We find that government innovation procurement significantly enhances peer firms' innovation efficiency. Our mechanism analyses reveal that government innovation procurement sends positive signals, increasing peer firms' citations of procured firms' patents, thereby improving their innovation efficiency. The heterogeneity analyses indicate that this positive relationship is more pronounced when peer firms occupy comparable market positions, operate in regions with high-speed rail, have common analysts with the procured firms, and are classified as high-tech enterprises. We also find that central government procurement, cross-regional procurement, and evaluation methods involving “competitive consultation and negotiation” significantly enhance peer firms' innovation efficiency. Overall, our findings provide theoretical guidance and practical insights for governments to foster firm innovation and advance high-quality industrial development through innovation procurement.",10.1016/j.chieco.2025.102543,"Jiang, Hui; Liu, Yu; Dong, Junqi"

This systematic review synthesises research on environmental awareness models, exploring their definitions, conceptualisations, and roles in environmental education across diverse settings. Utilising the PRISMA framework, a comprehensive search was conducted in leading databases, namely SCOPUS, Web of Science, Springer, and Wiley Online Core Collection, yielding a total of 6,444 peer-reviewed articles from 2018 to 2024. This extensive review process identified 20 studies that were subjected to in-depth analysis. The review findings signify noteworthy theoretical advancements, with models integrating cognitive, emotional, and situational dimensions to devise innovative assessment tools and targeted educational strategies that promote sustainable behaviours. However, persistent challenges remain, including inadequate sampling techniques, limited use of advanced technologies such as big data and AI, and insufficient interdisciplinary collaboration, all of which hinder broader application. The findings emphasise the critical role of both formal and informal education in cultivating environmental awareness, highlighting how these frameworks shape sustainability-oriented attitudes and actions. The study also underscores gaps, such as the need for culturally sensitive models and longitudinal evaluations, and proposes comprehensive, technology-enhanced, and interdisciplinary approaches to address them.

Method and models for sentiment analysis and hidden propaganda finding,2023,3,Topic_3_social_media_social media,1.0,"The paper describes the method and system architecture for the intellectual analysis of text and emotions to support decision-making in the field of national security and defense. Considering the latest events in the world, mass media are becoming a powerful tool for manipulating public consciousness and promoting the interests of one country over another. The article describes the methodology of collecting historical articles from a website, analyzing peak news outbreaks, and analyzing each article's text. The morphological tagging and named-entity recognition as the core of natural language processing was described. A hybrid method based on learning rules and an ensemble of machine learning methods has been developed for sentiment analysis and covert propaganda. The proposed rule-based model allows choosing the class-based lexical approach or on collected dictionaries. The combination of the methods based on dictionaries and rules with the ensemble of machine learning models are developed. The developed stacking model combines weak classifiers and deformed meta-attributes based on the results of pairwise multiplication. Finally, the distorted features are used together with the training dataset in the meta-model. This combination avoids the correlation of the results of weak classifiers and increases the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach demonstrates high accuracy and usage for Russian and Ukrainian languages. The developed method is built on Chambers's proposal. As a result of the analysis, the manipulation of public consciousness and the number of negative articles about the two countries are determined.

"Content, formats and licensing of datasets from autonomous communities: Value generation, sustainability and proposals for improvement",2025,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.17607402656979654,"Open government data (OGD) initiatives, established at all levels of public administration and globally, have significant potential for value generation. However, their actual implementation often reveals significant shortcomings that hinder their potential for value creation. This study addresses a critical gap in the literature by evaluating the design of OGD policies in Spain, focusing specifically on the industrial sector at the autonomous community level. The research assesses the available data's content, formats, and licensing through a population-based analysis of all datasets labeled under the “industry” category across the 17 Spanish autonomous communities. The findings reveal a fragmented and inconsistent landscape: of over 46,000 datasets published by autonomous community governments, only 532 were initially labeled as industry-related, and after a rigorous selection process—removing duplicates, outdated records, and mislabeling entries—only 316 were deemed valid. The study highlights a predominance of non-reusable formats such as HTML and a lack of standardisation in the categorization of information. While most datasets use open licenses (mainly Creative Commons BY), the variability in download options and formats limits their automated processing and reuse.

Data driven social partnerships: Exploring an emergent trend in search of research challenges and questions,2019,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.17948299138757107,"The volume of data collected by multiple devices, such as mobile phones, sensors, satellites, is growing at an exponential rate. Accessing and aggregating different sources of data, including data outside the public domain, has the potential to provide insights for many societal challenges. This catalyzes new forms of partnerships between public, private, and nongovernmental actors aimed at leveraging different sources of data for positive societal impact and the public good. In practice there are different terms in use to label these partnerships but research has been lagging behind in systematically examining this trend. In this paper, we deconstruct the conceptualization and examine the characteristics of this emerging phenomenon by systematically reviewing academic and practitioner literature. To do so, we use the grounded theory literature review method. We identify several concepts which are used to describe this phenomenon and propose an integrative definition of “data driven social partnerships” based on them. We also identify a list of challenges which data driven social partnerships face and explore the most urgent and most cited ones, thereby proposing a research agenda. Finally, we discuss the main contributions of this emerging research field, in relation to the challenges, and systematize the knowledge base about this phenomenon for the research community.",10.1016/j.giq.2018.11.002,"Susha, Iryna; Grönlund, Åke; Van Tulder, Rob"
Stakeholder roles in artificial intelligence projects,2022,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Algorithmic decision-making implemented through artificial intelligence (AI) projects is augmenting or replacing human decision-making across numerous industries. Although AI systems may impact individuals and society in life-and-death situations, project organizations or plans may ignore the concerns of the passive stakeholders.

It employs stakeholder theory and a systematic literature review with thematic analysis to identify and classify individuals, groups, and organizations into six stakeholder project roles. It configures the stakeholder salience model with a harm attribute to identify passive stakeholders—individuals affected by AI systems but powerless to affect the project—and their nexus to the project.

Therefore, in 2016, the American Society of Radiation Oncology performed an evaluation of research grant funding for RO. Methods and Materials Members of the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiation Oncology Programs (SCAROP) were asked about funded and unfunded grants that were submitted by their departments between the fiscal years 2014 and 2016. Grants were grouped according to broad categories defined by the 2017 American Society of Radiation Oncology Research Agenda. Additionally, active grants in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools database were collated using RO faculty names. Results Overall, there were 816 funded (44%) and 1031 unfunded (56%) SCAROP-reported grants. Total grant funding was over $196 million. The US government funded the plurality (42.2%; 345 of 816) of grants compared with nonprofit and industry funders. Investigators from 10 institutions accounted for >75% of funded grants. Of the funded grants, 43.5% were categorized as “genomic influences and targeted therapies.” The proportion of funded to unfunded grants was highest within the category of “tumor microenvironment, normal tissue effects, and reducing toxicity” (53.4% funded). “New clinical trial design and big data” had the smallest share of SCAROP grant applications and the lowest percent funded (38.3% of grants). NIH grants to RO researchers in 2014 to 2016 accounted for $85 million in funding. From the 31 responding SCAROP institutions, there was a 28% average success rate for RO proposals submitted to the NIH during this period. Conclusions Though RO researchers from responding institutions were relatively successful in obtaining funding, the overall amount awarded remains small.

IoT-enabled dynamic capabilities in real-time sensing and responding can spur digital transformation in unlocking the potential of digital government into data-driven smart government capable of delivering policies and services of public interest and public value. However, the literature indicates challenges in IoT cybersecurity and systemic use across the government. There is the urgent need for IoT research on policy and use. This paper developed a framework for IoT-enabled smart government performance. We applied this framework to conduct case study analyses of digital technology policy, IoT cybersecurity policy, and IoT use in major application domains at the U.S. federal government level.

Emerging trends in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation higher education,2024,-1,Outliers,0.13049416406456588,"Increasing learning opportunities and teaching capacities in higher education (HE) institutions in the domain of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) is a key pre-requisite not only to enhance individual and collective knowledge, but also to forge resilient societies. However, several barriers exist that hinder the development and delivery of education curricula, including, e.g. fragmentation of DRR education offers across different departments and programs, limited availability of guidelines for standard requirements, and inadequate funding. Little research has been carried out to compare HE practices, to identify similarities, differences and emerging trends. In this paper, we present a review of the literature and of existing practices, including e.g. master’s programs, postgraduate diploma/certificates, training courses, and transnational academic networks. The analytical framework includes content, pedagogical and structural features, practice orientation, and institutional anchoring. Emerging trends include an increasing relevance attributed to topics such as the use of big data for DRR/CCA, social aspects of DRR/CCA, multi-risk approaches, synergies between CCA and DRR, and links between disasters and development. Critical and creative thinking-led teaching, engagement of practitioners for teaching, multi-/inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches are presented as pedagogical innovations in several practices.

"Artificial intelligence in government: Concepts, standards, and a unified framework",2023,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in generative language modelling, hold the promise of transforming government. Given the advanced capabilities of new AI systems, it is critical that these are embedded using standard operational procedures, clear epistemic criteria, and behave in alignment with the normative expectations of society. Scholars in multiple domains have subsequently begun to conceptualize the different forms that AI applications may take, highlighting both their potential benefits and pitfalls. However, the literature remains fragmented, with researchers in social science disciplines like public administration and political science, and the fast-moving fields of AI, ML, and robotics, all developing concepts in relative isolation. Although there are calls to formalize the emerging study of AI in government, a balanced account that captures the full depth of theoretical perspectives needed to understand the consequences of embedding AI into a public sector context is lacking. Here, we unify efforts across social and technical disciplines by first conducting an integrative literature review to identify and cluster 69 key terms that frequently co-occur in the multidisciplinary study of AI. We then build on the results of this bibliometric analysis to propose three new multifaceted concepts for understanding and analysing AI-based systems for government (AI-GOV) in a more unified way: (1) operational fitness, (2) epistemic alignment, and (3) normative divergence. Finally, we put these concepts to work by using them as dimensions in a conceptual typology of AI-GOV and connecting each with emerging AI technical measurement standards to encourage operationalization, foster cross-disciplinary dialogue, and stimulate debate among those aiming to rethink government with AI.",10.1016/j.giq.2023.101881,"Straub, Vincent J.; Morgan, Deborah; Bright, Jonathan; Margetts, Helen"

Smart sustainable cities of the future: An extensive interdisciplinary literature review,2017,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.6211062100881615,"In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind.

Addressing the gap in research on creative sector data's role and place in urban data ecology, it applies de Kerckhove's (1998) “Connected Intelligence” theoretical model to propose a three-pillar assessment framework for Smart Cultural Data Intelligence across urban policies, data infrastructure and governance. A Singapore case study, chosen for its dual smart and creative city agendas, employs triangulation methodology: policy analysis, governance mapping, and data infrastructure assessment. Findings reveal a policy disjuncture between Singapore's creative and smart city initiatives, limitations in public participation, and the need for robust, integrative data systems to enable cross-sector data sharing for sustainable urban planning. The Singapore case highlights challenges and opportunities in strategically positioning cultural data within a smart city context to recommend a unified policy framework with inclusive data governance and enhanced infrastructure to facilitate cross-sector collaboration. These recommendations emphasize a holistic approach balancing technology, people, and policies.

However, there is no empirical evidence of the extent of applications and the permeability level in ensuring the three resources’ security. This study explored the relationship of the fourth industrial revolution technologies and the water, energy, and food nexus by evaluating the applications of the various technologies of 4IR on WEF nexus and examined the effect of 4IR on WEF nexus. The objectives were achieved using the qualitative methodology and bibliometric analysis of content analysis. The result showed that most fourth industrial revolution technologies had not been integrated with the WEF nexus. The result showed that only the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data analytics had permeated the nexus, which shows that data of the resources will be the foundation of the nexus. The systematic collection, accuracy of data, and empirical analysis of data will determine the level of security of WEF nexus. The qualitative results show that there are applications of the fourth industrial revolution technologies to the individual sectors of the nexus, birthing Water 4.0, Energy 4.0, and Food 4.0. The Bibliometric analysis result shows that the integration of the fourth industrial revolution with the WEF nexus will lead to cleaner production practices relating to the technological processes of water, energy, and food resources. These practices will ensure the environment's safety from WEF wastes and the water, energy, and food security in production processes. The empirical research and bibliometric analysis result, rooted in the concept of cleaner production, shows that the fourth industrial revolution affected the WEF nexus. The effects are; the birth of clean technologies & industrial applications, the catalyst for sustainability security of WEF nexus leveraging on life cycle thinking, enablement of technological transfer, enhancement of economic growth, and urban planning. The study concludes that the fourth industrial revolution technologies affect WEF nexus, ensuring the popularization of cleaner production strategies and processes of the resources during trade-offs and synergies. The study recommends the integration of a cleaner production concept in WEF processing.

Institutional theory in accounting information systems research: Shedding light on digital transformation and institutional change,2024,-1,Outliers,0.08914403035682456,"This article aims to shed light on digital transformation in the accounting sector from the perspective of institutional change. We performed a systematic literature review to understand how institutional change could be applied to research on Accounting Information Systems (AIS), using a quantitative method to categorize data through LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) technique; and a qualitative method performed by hierarchical categorical content analysis as a basis for inferences. We reviewed 309 articles using Institutional Theory in accounting and AIS. The LSA results presented the main topics of study, subfields of research, and uses of Institutional Theory. Regarding accounting research, it is possible to identify the role of institutional forces in the IFRS adoption (in private and public sectors), XBRL adoption, and disclosure of information on organizations’ environmental, social, and governance, with a focus on analyses at the organizational level and regulatory pressures. A deep dive into AIS articles showed that Institutional Theory was applied to analyze the adoption of systems/technologies (mostly ERP and XBRL) through isomorphic processes (coercive, mimetic, and normative). We proposed to analyze digital technologies as an exogenous change for the digital transformation in accounting business using another perspective of Institutional Theory: institutional change. Institutional change analyzes the role of destabilizing elements in the change of an organizational field as a whole and not just in a few organizations. In this perspective, technology is the agent of change on a broader level, transforming organizations, individuals, customers, suppliers, and governments.

To achieve this, articles were identified and reviewed that were published in the Chartered Association of Business Schools’ (ABS) ≥ 2-star journals. Based on these findings, the second objective of this paper will be to propose a synergistic framework that relates existing research on DT to the areas of business and management, which will help form the evolutionary perspective taken in this paper. Considering the emerging development of the topic under investigation, the framework is understood as a sound basis for continued discussion and forthcoming research.",10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102466,"Kraus, Sascha; Durst, Susanne; Ferreira, João J.; Veiga, Pedro; Kailer, Norbert; Weinmann, Alexandra"
Barriers to the digitalisation and innovation of Australian Smart Real Estate: A managerial perspective on the technology non-adoption,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.",10.1016/j.eti.2021.101527,"Ullah, Fahim; Sepasgozar, Samad M.E.; Thaheem, Muhammad Jamaluddin; Al-Turjman, Fadi"

The impacts of open data initiatives on smart cities: A framework for evaluation and monitoring,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.42419990117556194,"As the world's population is becoming progressively urban-dwelling, sustainable development challenges are increasingly concentrated in cities, placing tremendous pressure on society to build more sustainable, innovative, and equitable urban environments. Consequently, today's cities require integrated policies and new innovative ways to manage and improve the complexity of urban living conditions. The growing volume and variety of data produced in the urban ecosystem are crucial for obtaining the city's insights and building knowledge-based solutions for a smarter and more sustainable urban development. In this paper, we look at the open data impacts on these complex ecosystems and its crucial enabler role for the generation and analysis of contextual and actionable data aimed at understanding, managing, and planning the city. Despite the importance of open data, the literature is scarce in systematic and structured research that evaluates its impacts on the smart city context. This paper explores this gap by proposing a theoretical framework, composed of a model and an experiment grounded on the use of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT), designed to give a more detailed view concerning the context and characteristics of the impacts of open data initiatives on smart cities' sustainable development. This work will contribute to open data management and smart city development, providing boundaries and theoretical insights for further research and experimentation on how open data can be leveraged to develop better smart cities.",10.1016/j.cities.2020.102860,"Neves, Fátima Trindade; de Castro Neto, Miguel; Aparicio, Manuela"
The role of sustainability in the relationship between migration and smart cities: a bibliometric review,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7001362567687388,"Purpose Smart cities attract efficient and profitable economic activities, contribute to the societal welfare of their citizens and foster the efficient use and conservation of natural resources. Developing smart cities has become a priority for many developed countries, but as they are preferred destinations for migrants, this raises sustainability issues. They attract people who are seeking a better quality of life, smart services and solutions, a better environment and business activities. The purpose of this paper is to review the state of the art on the relationship between smart cities and migration, with a view to determining sustainability. Design/methodology/approach A bibliometric review and text mining analyses were conducted on publications between 2000 and 2019. Findings The results determined the main parameters of this research topic in terms of its growth, top journals and articles. The role of sustainability in the relationship between smart cities and migration is also identified, highlighting the special interest of its social dimension.

Situating the compliance with land use regulations within the context of sustainable city development: Lessons from Ho Municipality of Ghana,2025,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Urbanizing in cities in the global south continues to reshape land use systems. Consequently, theuncontrolled rate of urbanization in cities such as Ho in Ghana, continues to threaten the sustainability of urban natural assets and agricultural lands. Although there are existing land use regulations and guidelines to guide and control development, the enforcement of these regulations continues to face major challenges. In light of this, this study evaluates the effectiveness of land use regulations in the Ho Municipality and its implications for sustainable city development. In this study, the researchers relied on both primary and secondary data. The primary data were collected through interviews with representatives of institutions such as the Lands Commission, the Traditional Council, and the Ho Municipal Assembly. In terms secondary data, base maps of the study areas, Medium-Term Development Plans, the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act, 2016 (Act 925) and the Zoning Guidelines and Planning Standards were reviewed, serving as tge framework for the assessment of the extent of compliance. Overall, the findings points to a complex combination of compliance and non-compliance with land use regulations. Whereas compliance with land use regulations and activities in the study areas tend to promote sustainability,non-compliance with these regulations on the other hand threatens urban sustainability. For example, in the Ho Poly Area, there was no evidence of encroachment of the buffer zones of overhead power lines and arterial roads. This indicates that there is compliance with land use regulations, and this has positive implications for the sustainability of the city. However, there were no provisions for urban green spaces in the neighbourhood plan, which raises concerns on the ecological and general sustainability of the city. On this backdrop, the researchers recommend stricter enforcement and the adoption of effective urban planning strategies such as institutional collaboration to achieve sustainable city development. Additionally, adopting emerging techniques such as big data, machine learning, and IoT for urban planning and management in these Ghanaian cities can enhance sustainable development.",10.1016/j.ugj.2024.12.011,"Asamoah, Pearl Seyram; Takyi, Stephen Appiah; Liwur, Stephen Biliyitorb; Amponsah, Owusu; Duamor, Sylvanus Narh"
Building a government-owned open data platform for connected and autonomous vehicles,2024,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.11501194689799406,"The growing recognition of the societal implications stemming from technological advancements highlights the need for innovative governance approaches, particularly in urban environments. Focused on connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), this study proposes an integrated analytical framework for a dedicated open data platform (ODP). By integrating thematic analysis with process landscape and stakeholder analysis methods, we present a holistic CAV-ODP model positioned to optimize benefits across industries, public sectors, and society as a whole. We argue that multiple stakeholders can enhance both supply and demand aspects of the CAV-ODP, catalyzing activities such as data access, management, transformation, incubation, coordination, education, and application. Importantly, it advocates for government-led integration of interests spanning private and public domains, fostering a collaborative social network for data application and innovation. This inquiry not only reveals the social benefits generated by open CAV data but also underlines the significance of the CAV-ODP platform as an innovative governance arrangement, serving as a catalyst for a culture of sharing, bolstering collaborative governance, and preserving public value amid disruptive technological changes. Overall, the concept of government leadership is universally applicable, with the tangible power dynamics among the government, private sectors, and society influencing the expeditious materialization of the proposed framework.",10.1016/j.cities.2024.104918,"Deng, Handuo; Hu, Qi; Guan, ChengHe; Chen, Yi Samuel; Menendez, Monica"
The development of New Public Financial Management scholarship: from global warning to emerging warnings,2025,-1,Outliers,0.10426485974949072,"Purpose New Public Management (NPM) and New Public Financial Management (NPFM) have significantly influenced the transformation of several nation-states’ public sectors. This study examines the development of NPFM scholarship over the past 25 years, focusing on 3 foundational works that have substantially shaped this field (i.e. Olson et al., 1998, 2001; Guthrie et al., 1999). The study identifies key research themes within these foundational works and provides insights into the field’s emerging warnings and research directions. Design/methodology/approach Our structured literature review collected 325 research articles from 1999 to 2024 from the Scopus database. These articles were chosen for their references to three key foundational works and were systematically analysed based on predefined NPFM themes. This was further enhanced by a traditional literature review of selected articles within each NPFM category, offering an analysis of NPFM scholarship and identifying potential future research paths. Findings In examining the focus of the sampled articles among the five NPFM themes, we found that the majority have centred on the themes of financial reporting and performance measurement systems. Less attention has been given to auditing and budgetary themes. Various studies examined multiple NPFM themes simultaneously. We also provided valuable insights into both the challenges and opportunities for future scholarship. Research limitations/implications The study presents an extensive analysis of 25 years of NPFM research related to three foundational works, highlighting the interconnectedness of various developments.

Management accounting and the concepts of exploratory data analysis and unsupervised machine learning: a literature study and future directions,2021,-1,Outliers,0.0945734657175835,"Purpose This paper contributes to the literature by discussing the impact of machine learning (ML) on management accounting (MA) and the management accountant based on three sources: academic articles, papers and reports from accounting bodies and consulting companies. The purpose of this paper is to identify, discuss and provide suggestions for how ML could be included in research and education in the future for the management accountant. Design/methodology/approach This paper identifies three types of studies on the influence of ML on MA issued between 2015 and 2021 in mainstream accounting journals, by professional accounting bodies and by large consulting companies. Findings First, only very few academic articles actually show examples of using ML or using different algorithms related to MA issues. This is in contrast to other research fields such as finance and logistics. Second, the literature review also indicates that if the management accountants want to keep up with the demand of their qualifications, they must take action now and begin to discuss how big data and other concepts from artificial intelligence and ML can benefit MA and the management accountant in specific ways. Originality/value Even though the paper may be classified as inspirational in nature, the paper documents and discusses the revised environment that surrounds the accountant today. The paper concludes by highlighting specifically the necessity of including exploratory data analysis and unsupervised ML in the field of MA to close the existing gaps in both education and research and thus making the MA profession future-proof.",10.1108/JAOC-08-2020-0107,"Nielsen, Steen"
Geospatial data in the UK,2019,-1,Outliers,0.1354787751585017,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explain the rise of geospatial data, its importance for business and some of the problems associated with its development and use. Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews a certain amount of previously published literature but is based mainly on analysis of the very large number of responses to a consultation paper on geospatial data published by the UK Government. Findings The findings are that while there is strong appreciation of the potential benefits of using geospatial data, there are many barriers to the development, sharing and use of geospatial data, ranging from problems of incompatibility in data definitions and systems to regulatory issues. The implication for governments and for providers and users of geospatial data relates to the need to take a long-term approach to planning in resolving the issues identified. Research limitations/implications The research findings are limited to the UK, but similar findings would be likely in any other large Western country. Practical implications This paper confirms the need for a strong and coherent approach to the planning of geospatial data and systems for the establishment of a clear basis for the different parties to work together and the need to clearly separate the roles of the government in establishing frameworks and standards and the role of the private sector in developing applications and solutions. Social implications Society is increasingly dependent on the use of geospatial data, in improving living standards and dealing with social problems. The recommendations identified in this paper, if followed, will facilitate these improvements. Originality/value The value of this paper is the tight synthesis that it provides of a wide ranging and complex range of responses to the UK Government consultation and placing these responses in the wider context of the development of geospatial data.",10.1108/BL-09-2019-0115,"Jozefowicz, Suzanne; Stone, Merlin; Aravopoulou, Eleni"
Cutting through the clutter of smart city definitions: A reading into the smart city perceptions in India,2019,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7996862887422458,"Smart city development has emerged as a favoured response to the 21st-century urbanisation challenges. A wide range of definitions surfaced over the last decade characterising the smart city, primarily pushed by the global elite corporations and influential academics. Simultaneously, a series of urban development expressions, such as digital city, knowledge city, eco-city is used interchangeably with the smart city, significantly mystifying the reading of the concept. This paper, first argue that smart city interpretation needs and requires the input and contribution of the local stakeholders. The aim of this research is to provide an evidence-based framework to capture the perception of local urban actors in India vis-à-vis their interpretation of smart cities given the existing urban conditions and the proposed developments under the 100 Smart Cities Mission. This research also examines the underlying linkage between the smart city and its conceptual relatives and highlights the ones with a significant convergence with the emerging urban agenda in India's Smart Cities Mission. The analysis presented in this paper show that to emerge as a holistic concept, smart cities definition models should engage with the sustainability and community issues, beyond the use of digital technology. The research reveals that the Indian urban stakeholders strongly associate the smart city concept with sustainable city and eco-city, much more than the technology-loaded phrases such as ubiquitous city and digital city. The first-of-its-kind inclusive approach developed in this paper to define smart city takes on the monopolies of top-down smart city definitions and support the democratisation of the rapidly proliferating concept.",10.1016/j.ccs.2019.05.005,"Praharaj, Sarbeswar; Han, Hoon"

"Mobility-as-a-service transitions in China: Emerging policies, initiatives, platforms and MaaS implementation models",2023,-1,Outliers,0.4102926610064165,"The concept of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is gaining increasing attention in both academic and policy discourses concerning the future of transport and mobility. The current understanding of the progress of MaaS is based on the handful of studies that have explored pilot initiatives carried out mainly in Europe and North America. In contrast, this paper extends the literature by exploring the evolution of MaaS in mainland China. It examines how the concept of MaaS emerged in China, identifies and maps on-going MaaS initiatives and platforms across Chinese cities, and investigates the most common approaches and models of MaaS delivery. The analysis reveals that while Chinese government policy has long discussed integrated transport, MaaS and related aspects, including ‘one-stop’ mobility services and ‘Chuixing Ji Fuwu’, which is the Chinese translation of Mobility-as-a-Service, have only appeared in recent times. At present, 41 Chinese cities are hosting ongoing MaaS initiatives and associated platforms. These are concentrated in the developed eastern regions, in cities with high political influence and larger populations. The geography of MaaS strongly reflects the prevailing digital divide in China, implying that deliberate policy choices are needed to avert widening transport and mobility inequalities in the age of MaaS. MaaS platforms currently only provide basic information and modal/service integration and are deployed either as bespoke applications or added to existing social media and navigation applications. Two main models of MaaS delivery were identified: public-controlled model that is predominant and centered primarily on integrating existing state-run public transport services, and partnership model that is emerging in cities such as Beijing to integrate more mobility services beyond conventional public transport. The complex landscape of actors associated with the emerging public–private partnership model presents new challenges for transport governance, especially in balancing an established tradition of strong public sector control over transport on the one hand, and the interests of the fledgling private sector mobility service providers on the other hand.",10.1016/j.cstp.2023.101054,"Chen, Yuyuan; Acheampong, Ransford A."
Is there anybody out there? The place and role of citizens in tomorrow’s smart cities,2016,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7807030312258884,"Imagining tomorrow’s life implies, to a large degree, imagining the kind of cities we will inhabit in the future. In this framework, the smart city is actually a popular vision in discourses on urban development. This paper explores alternative ways in which citizens are positioned within different imaginaries of the smart city. The premise is that most mainstream discourses implicitly assume that smart city projects will empower and improve the lives of citizens. However, their role is often ambiguous. While some visions of the smart city are characterised by the absence of citizen’s voices, others are populated by active citizens operating as urban sensors. Furthermore there are fearful visions of a future in which citizens will be subjugated by technologies that will hamper their freedom. This paper analyses the role of citizens in four alternative smart city imaginaries. The thesis proposed is that all four imaginaries are characterised by citizens playing a subaltern role, and hence the smart city is a relatively poor concept if intended as a model of the urban life of the future.",10.1016/j.futures.2016.05.010,"Vanolo, Alberto"
How public digital governance system affects firms' digital technology innovation performance: Base on open innovation perspective,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.577846244590306,"Public digital governance (PDG) represents the government's capacity to leverage digital technologies in public administration. From a systems perspective, PDG encompasses four core dimensions and exhibits the distinctive characteristics of holism-emergence and independence-modularity. Drawing upon the framework of open innovation, this study investigates the key mechanisms through which PDG influences the digital technology innovation performance (DTIP) of enterprises. Utilizing a dynamic panel model based on data from Chinese provincial governments and listed firms, the paper inspects a benchmark effect and examines the transmission pathways through mediating, moderating, and threshold effect models. The empirical results reveal several findings. First, within the open innovation context, the enhancement of PDG directly improves DTIP, while the presence of CTO-equivalent positions within firms contributes to heterogeneity under the impact of PDG. Second, PDG enhances DTIP through multiple parallel mediating mechanisms, including the accumulation of information capital, the reduction of technological blockade, the promotion of knowledge integration, and the acceleration of corporate digitalization. Additionally, a chain mediating mechanism is identified, wherein PDG influences regional digital homogeneity, thereby facilitating corporate digitalization, finally impacts DTIP. Third, regional innovation and entrepreneurship activity positively moderates the relationship between PDG and DTIP, whereas corporate attention to digitalization exhibits a nonlinear threshold effect. This study conceptualizes the key dimensions of PDG from a systems theory perspective, unpacks the underlying mechanisms linking PDG to DTIP and offers valuable implications for understanding the coordinated development of public digital governance and firm innovation performance.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.103001,"Du, Yang; Xu, Jun; Yuan, Xiao"
Trajectories and connections in socio-environmental disclosure research: A bibliometric mapping,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.41701097605551907,"The objective of this research is to conduct a systematic review of scientific literature regarding socio-environmental disclosure.

Artificial intelligence use in collaborative network processes,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7745724684013978,"This paper reviews the literature to analyse the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in collaborative processes among supply chain (SC) partners, thereby forming a collaborative network (CN). Given the growth of AI and its limited exploration in many business strategies, especially when collaboration among SC partners’ is established, this paper focuses on defining the lines of research and application of AI in CN processes, by presenting insights into how AI can improve the resilience and the antifragility. It examines the integration of AI in CN processes from the following perspectives: (i) the collaborative processes addressed among the CN partners, (ii) the decision-making level of the collaborative processes performed, (iii) the SC partners involved in the collaboration; (iv) the technologies combined with AI to support CN processes; (v) the programming languages implemented to develop AI algorithms; (vi) the SC sectors in which AI is mainly implemented to perform collaborative processes; and (vii) the potential of implementing AI in CN processes, in an increasingly turbulent and disruptive business world. The study focuses on SC in various sectors, including food, transport, logistics, manufacturing, healthcare or electronics, among others. In addition, the review provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between collaborative processes and AI-driven advances, identifying the technologies that can merge with AI to support CN processes. The results have enabled the development of a conceptual framework for AI use collaborative processes and outline the benefits, risks and challenges associated with the use of AI in CN, while proposing future research directions in this area.",10.1016/j.jii.2025.100883,"Andres, B.; Urze, P.; Araujo, E.; Camarinha-Matos, L.M."

A utility-based news recommendation system,2019,3,Topic_3_social_media_social media,1.0,"News platforms exhibit both the challenges as well as opportunities for enhancing the functionalities of recommendation systems in today's big data environment. Novel use of big data storage and programming models can improve news recommendation systems through efficient handling and analysis of clickstream data and a better understanding of users' interests. Most existing approaches to news recommendation consider users' clicks as the implicit feedback to understand user behaviors. However, “clicks” may not be an effective indicator of real user interests. We address this problem by developing a novel news recommendation system based on a news utility model. Given the new utility model, we propose a two stage news recommendation framework. The framework first generates article-level recommendation rules based on the utility model, then integrates the notion of utility and probabilistic topic models and generates topic-level recommendation rules. We argue that the proposed utility-based news recommendation system also addresses the news cold start problem which is one of the most challenging obstacles for news agencies. We evaluate the framework on a massive real dataset (two billion records) obtained from a major newspaper (i.e., The Globe and Mail) in Canada and show that it outperforms the existing methods.",10.1016/j.dss.2018.12.001,"Zihayat, Morteza; Ayanso, Anteneh; Zhao, Xing; Davoudi, Heidar; An, Aijun"
"Reconciling business intelligence, analytics and decision support systems: More data, deeper insight",2021,-1,Outliers,0.07222642670702915,"Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A) systems have demonstrated their potential to enhance decision making; however, the linkage between BI&A and decision support systems (DSS) has been contested by some, if not completely denied by others. In this research, we investigate the foundations of BI&A by using foundational literature on DSS to open the ‘black box’ of BI&A systems. We argue that BI&A is fundamentally a subfield of DSS that is seeking to convert more data into deeper insight, but it has lost its connection to DSS literature and, thereby, missed research opportunities. In this paper, we first define DSS and BI&A and then present a systematic review of foundational DSS literature to assess their leveraging in BI&A research. By classifying cited DSS articles and citing BI&A articles into four areas: conceptual framework, design & implementation, business value & organizational use, and cognition & decision making, potential research for BI&A is uncovered. We reconcile these two research streams by mapping BI&A frameworks to classical DSS components through interviews with practitioners. The result is formulated as a comparative, process-level architecture for converting data into insight. New research opportunities for BI&A are suggested motivated by foundational DSS literature.",10.1016/j.dss.2021.113560,"Phillips-Wren, Gloria; Daly, Mary; Burstein, Frada"
25 Years of Digital Health Toward Universal Health Coverage in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Rapid Systematic Review,2025,-1,Outliers,0.1352688367377982,"Background Over the last 25 years, digital health interventions in low- and middle-income countries have undergone substantial transformations propelled by technological advancements, increased internet accessibility, and a deeper appreciation of the benefits of digital tools in enhancing health care availability. Objective This study aims to examine the evolution, impact, and prospects of digital health interventions in low- and middle-income countries, highlighting their role in improving health care accessibility and equity. Methods A retrospective analysis of digital health initiatives scanning the past two and a half decades focused on the progression from basic SMS platforms to sophisticated mobile health apps and other health digital interventions. Relevant literature and case studies were reviewed to elucidate key milestones, successes, challenges, and opportunities in advancing digital health initiatives in low- and middle-income regions. Results Digital health initiatives in low- and middle-income countries initially targeted specific health concerns, such as malaria diagnosis and treatment, through text-based platforms, demonstrating their efficacy in reaching remote and marginalized communities. With the proliferation of mobile phone ownership and internet access, these interventions evolved into comprehensive mobile health apps, facilitating self-care support, patient education, chronic disease monitoring, and remote consultations. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption of digital health interventions, particularly in disseminating health information, supporting contact tracing efforts, and enabling virtual consultations to alleviate strain on health care systems. Conclusions The future of digital health interventions in low- and middle-income countries holds immense promise, fueled by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain. However, challenges persist in ensuring equitable access to digital health technologies, addressing disparities in digital literacy, and establishing robust health care infrastructure. Collaboration among governments, health care providers, technology innovators, and communities is essential to overcome these challenges and harness the full potential of digital health to improve health care outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.",10.2196/59042,"Sylla, Bry; Ismaila, Ouedraogo; Diallo, Gayo"
AI adoption and diffusion in public administration: A systematic literature review and future research agenda,2023,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.7821353970778363,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementation in public administration is gaining momentum heralded by the hope of smart public services that are personalised, lean, and efficient. However, the use of AI in public administration is riddled with ethical tensions of fairness, transparency, privacy, and human rights. We call these AI tensions. The current literature lacks a contextual and processual understanding of AI adoption and diffusion in public administration to be able to explore such tensions. Previous studies have outlined risks, benefits, and challenges with the use of AI in public administration. However, a large gap remains in understanding AI tensions as they relate to public value creation. Through a systematic literature review grounded in public value management and the resource-based view of the firms, we identify technology-organisational-environmental (TOE) contextual variables and absorptive capacity as factors influencing AI adoption as discussed in the literature.

A systematic literature review and analysis towards developing PPP models for delivering smart infrastructure,2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.5497815841068768,"Purpose Rising human aspirations leading to rapid urbanisation, amidst climate changes and other environmental pressures have aggravated the needs for better-focused sustainable urban development in general as well as for smart and sustainable cities in particular. Indeed, smart infrastructure (SI) development is a prerequisite for smart cities (SCs). However, inadequate funding and expertise for such SI development pose profound challenges that may be partially addressed by mobilising private finance and efficiencies through collaborative public–private partnership (PPP) models. This paper provides a holistic review and analysis of the relevant literature, as a basis for proposing such PPP models for developing SI. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review helped to fulfil the aim of this paper in the first phase of the underlying longer-term study. Authoritative search engines like Scopus and Web of Science indexed articles were reviewed and analysed, 85% of these being journal articles. Findings SCs that necessarily include SI are important in overcoming current urban challenges in developing and developed countries. Given shortfalls in traditional procurement and funding models, special PPP models are required for SI development. After identifying the relevant needs, drivers, barriers and challenges in different countries, a general indicative framework is developed to illustrate how the various interacting force fields can be harnessed to develop the envisaged PPP models that can complement non-PPP procurement models. Originality/value PPP for SI development is a relatively new, hence, under-researched topic.

Building spatial cloud-based local government services,2015,-1,Outliers,0.14280788717564816,"Nowadays, administrators and practitioners want to speed up task processes, as decision-making and application periods in business life have been decreasing. As a result of this demand, accessing data clusters outdoors is now a necessity. Space and time dependency for accessing data has been reduced with the help of information technologies. Recently, a new technology called cloud computing (CC) has been developed to store and share the data under an Internet infrastructure. From a traditional viewpoint, editing, analysing and sharing spatial data have been made by way of a geographical information system (GIS). When technology developers harmonised CC and GIS, a new technological era called spatial cloud computing (SCC) or cloud GIS emerged. SCC is an efficient tool that is used for refining GIS applications and also delivering a comprehensive service for local governments. CC presents new important research eras in terms of development of GIS technology.

The empirical analysis of the temporal co-author network can trace the emerging authors and knowledge bursts over time. Design/methodology/approach The study applied social network theory to trace the author collaboration patterns in the domain of e-governance. Analysis of the co-author network using micro and macro parameters was done to trace the temporal evolution of the author collaborations. Findings E-governance is a multi-disciplinary research domain split over streams of management, politics, information technology and electronics. Hence, research collaborations play a significant role in its advancement. The knowledge sharing between individual authors, institutions and groups through research collaborations, resulting in extensive sharing of data, equipment and research methods, has boosted research activities and development in e-governance. In this paper, the authors systematically analyse the current scenario of research collaborations in the area of e-governance using co-author network to estimate its impact on the advancement of the field. The authors also analysed the temporal evolution of the co-author networks, which show remarkable growth of research collaborations in the domain of e-governance from the year 2000. Research limitations/implications The co-author network analysis is only a proxy measure for the analysis of research collaborations. The names of the authors and the university affiliations used in the article are as retrieved from the research repository of Scopus. The degree, citations and other parameters related with authors have scope only within the environment of the co-author network used in the analysis. The criteria used in the study is limited to the degree of research collaborations and the number of co-authored publications in the giant component of the co-author network. Practical implications Institutions, authors and governments can trace and select suitable topics and choose research groups of co-authors over the world for future research collaborations in e-governance. The knowledge about the emerging and most discussed topics gives an overview of the global research trends of e-governance. Social implications The study identified the evolution of creative collaborations in e-governance in the global perspective. The methodology introduced here is helpful to detect the proficient and productive author collaborations and the spectrum of related e-governance research topics associated with them. As the author collaborations can be mapped to the institutional and country-level collaborations, the information is helpful for researchers, institutions and governments to establish the best collaborations in e-governance research based on the author proficiency, collaboration patterns and research topics as per the requirements.

Envisioning Contestability Loops: Evaluating the Agonistic Arena as a Generative Metaphor for Public AI,2024,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Public sector organizations increasingly use artificial intelligence to augment, support, and automate decision-making. However, such public AI can potentially infringe on citizens’ right to autonomy. Contestability is a system quality that protects against this by ensuring systems are open and responsive to disputes throughout their life cycle. While a growing body of work is investigating contestable AI by design, little of this knowledge has so far been evaluated with practitioners. To make explicit the guiding ideas underpinning contestable AI research, we construct the generative metaphor of the Agonistic Arena, inspired by the political theory of agonistic pluralism. Combining this metaphor and current contestable AI guidelines, we develop an infographic supporting the early-stage concept design of public AI system contestability mechanisms. We evaluate this infographic in five workshops paired with focus groups with a total of 18 practitioners, yielding ten concept designs. Our findings outline the mechanisms for contestability derived from these concept designs. Building on these findings, we subsequently evaluate the efficacy of the Agonistic Arena as a generative metaphor for the design of public AI and identify two competing metaphors at play in this space: the Black Box and the Sovereign.",10.1016/j.sheji.2024.03.003,"Alfrink, Kars; Keller, Ianus; Yurrita Semperena, Mireia; Bulygin, Denis; Kortuem, Gerd; Doorn, Neelke"

Operational research from Taylorism to Terabytes: A research agenda for the analytics age,2015,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.13519335204448618,"The growing attention and prominence afforded to analytics presents a genuine challenge for the operational research community. Many in the community have recognised this growth and sought to align themselves with analytics. For instance, the US operational research society INFORMS now offers analytics related conferences, certification and a magazine. However, as shown in this research, the volume of analytics-orientated studies in journals associated with operational research is comparatively low. This paper seeks to address this paradox by seeking to better understand what analytics is, and how operational research is related to it. To do so literature from a range of academic disciplines is analysed, in what is conceived as concurrent histories in the shared tradition of a management paradigm spread over the last 100 years. The findings of this analysis reveal new insights as to how operational research exists within an ecosystem shared with several other disciplines, and how interactions and ripple effects diffuse knowledge and ideas between each. Whilst this ecosystem is developed and evolved through interdisciplinary collaborations, individual disciplines are cast into competition for the attention of the same business users. These findings are further explored by discussing the implication this has for operational research, as well as considering what directions future research may take to maximise the potential value of these relationships.",10.1016/j.ejor.2014.08.029,"Mortenson, Michael J.; Doherty, Neil F.; Robinson, Stewart"
Barriers and risks of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) adoption in cities: A systematic review of the literature,2021,-1,Outliers,0.45624793035095584,"There is a growing demand, across the globe, for smart mobility solutions to reduce negative social, environmental and economic externalities of private automobile travel. Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is an integrated system that through a single online interface enables commuters to plan, book, and pay for trips which utilise a range of mobility providers. MaaS has a unique characteristic to provide a system into which new service options can be integrated with traditional transportation modes. This makes MaaS a potential alternative to private vehicle ownership, and a means to overcome some of the negative externalities associated with automobile dependency. To realise this potential, many cities have implemented—or are in the process of implementing—MaaS trials to better understand how this service will function within cities. This paper utilises a systematic literature review to extract insights, and develops a conceptual framework to identify barriers and risks related to MaaS adoption in cities. The study findings reveal that: (a) the desired MaaS outcomes are associated with reduced vehicle kilometres travelled, increased trip awareness, reduced parking, reduced vehicle ownership, and improved social equity; (b) MaaS supply side barriers include public private cooperation, business support, service coverage, shared vision, and data and cyber security; (c) MaaS demand side barriers are its lack of appeal to older generations, public transport users, and private vehicle users, the attractiveness of the digital platform, and user willingness-to-pay.",10.1016/j.cities.2020.103036,"Butler, Luke; Yigitcanlar, Tan; Paz, Alexander"
Which data should be publicly accessible?

While public managers are increasingly supportive of OGD initiatives worldwide, researchers note that they also carefully select which data to release to balance openness with traditional values of professionalism and secrecy as well as concerns about cyber incidents and privacy. Understanding the factors that influence this micro-level choice is important to make valuable types of data publicly accessible. Using 2018 survey data from a nationally representative sample of 2500 department heads in 500 small and medium-sized US cities, we look at variation in public managers' level of comfort with making different types of government data open - from criminal records to government employee salary data. We find that managerial comfort reflects historic practices of public accessibility and privacy concerns with individual data. Managers who believe OGD creates positive outcomes for society are more comfortable with publicly disclosing all types of data. We also find variation across department types, suggesting fragmented views towards OGD within public organizations.",10.1016/j.giq.2025.102008,"Feeney, Mary K.; Fusi, Federica; Pezo, Ignacio"
Assessing information security risks in the cloud: A case study of Australian local government authorities,2020,-1,Outliers,0.05435497302688331,"Cloud computing enables cost-effective and scalable growth of IT services that can enhance government services. Despite the Australian Federal Government's ‘cloud-first’ strategy and policies, and the Queensland State Government's ‘digital-first’ strategy, cloud services adoption at local government level has been limited—largely due to data security concerns. We reviewed the ISO 27002 Information Security standard with extant literature and found that operational security, individual awareness and compliance matters pose more significant government challenges than the often-highlighted technical and process-oriented cloud security requirements. This study identifies and explores the critical factors associated with information security requirements of cloud services within the Australian regional local government context. We conducted 21 field interviews with IT managers, and surveyed 480 IT staff from Australia's 47 regional local governments. We propose a conceptual cloud computing security requirements model with four components – data security; risk assessment; legal & compliance requirements; and business & technical requirements – in order to promote a balanced view on cloud security for governments.

"Rear view mirror, crystal ball: Predictions for the future of data protection law based on the history of environmental protection law",2017,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"Several authors have compared the impact of Big Data to the environmental impact of industrialisation (Kuneva, 2009, Schneier, 2013, Hirsch, 2006). This analogy seems useful: like the exhaust and use of chemical compounds, the omnipresent generation and subsequent use of personal data can impact individuals as well as society as a whole. Similarly to the effects of industrialisation, adverse side-effects of datafication on individuals, societies and ecosystems could manifest themselves only years later and in seemingly unrelated contexts. Industrialised societies have enacted laws in response to the adverse environmental effects of industrialisation. Theories from modern sociology and public awareness have played a significant role in this process. Similarly, the European Union has enacted the General Data Protection Regulation to address the risks of processing of personal data. But laws tend to come only after any negative impact has become sufficiently apparent. This has spurred the introduction of precaution- and discourse-based management of unknown risks. The GDPR appears to implement these risk management mechanisms less extensively than current environmental protection laws. As with the effects of industrialisation, the side-effects of datafication cannot be entirely known in advance. Privacy is currently a prime concern, but datafication can also affect entire societies if it results in a “digital panopticon”. Considering the influence of Risk Society Theory and Normal Accident Theory, two important social theories concerning industrial hazards, this article proposes a number of areas where future iterations of data protection law can be developed.",10.1016/j.clsr.2017.05.010,"Rhoen, Michiel"

The Role of Governance in Solving the Problems of SMEs:,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.19495085348122126,"ABSTRACT Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face various challenges such as lack of resources, financing, and networking capability. Many of the constraints could be mitigated with the help of proper governance in the SMEs. Many articles have explored the challenges faced by SMEs and how this challenge could be mitigated with the help of proper governance. However, very few studies have summarized the influence of governance in solving the problems of SMEs in one place. So, a systematic literature review has been made to find the role of governance in solving the problems of SMEs. As SMEs are the pillar of economic development for a country, their problems and solutions in one document could help practitioners and academician research and development further in this area. The findings suggest that governance may influence the problems associated with corporate networking, finance, cross-cultural interactions of SMEs.",10.4018/IJEGR.297229,"Kumar, Rishi Kant; Dubey, Amlendu Kumar"
Open government research over a decade: A systematic review,2021,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.1751211140462038,"Academic studies of open government have flourished in the last decade. Nevertheless, comprehensive reviews of open government have been limited. This research gap not only impedes our understanding of the overall body of knowledge on open government but also hinders the advancement of existing practices. To address this gap, this article systematically reviews 189 studies published from 2008 to 2019. Guiding this review are the central research questions: (1) How has the concept of open government been defined and conceptualized in the literature? (2) How is open government being used and implemented? (3) What outcomes or impacts are attributed to open government initiatives? This research found that open government is generally conceptualized as a new governing structure emphasizing both transparency (vision) and public participation (voice). However, it also identifies a “transparency-driven focus” for both the case selection of academic studies and practical implementation, which represents a gap between open government theory and practice. This research also reveals the lack of empirical evidence regarding the effects of open government and highlights methodological concerns of prior studies. The article concludes with a discussion on future research.",10.1016/j.giq.2021.101566,"Tai, Kuang-Ting"
"Theoretical dimensions for integrating research on anticipatory governance, scientific foresight and sustainable S&T public policy design",2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.3018696217456642,"The future of Science and Technology (S&T) is a continuous and strategic priority for governments, universities, and organizations, driving societal benefits through innovation, sustainability, and development. However, there is a gap—and a critical opportunity—for research on architectures supporting Anticipatory Governance (AG) that integrates Scientific Foresight (ScF) and the design of sustainable S&T policies, especially at federal and state levels in emerging countries. In this context, this paper aims to enhance understanding of the theoretical dimensions essential for integrating AG, ScF, and sustainable S&T policy design, proposing an emergent systemic framework. Adopting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), the analysis identifies seven theoretical dimensions that unify these three themes, opening new possibilities for integrated research. This method also supported the development of a systemic framework for Anticipatory Governance, Scientific Foresight, and Sustainable S&T Policy Design, setting up foundational components for further testing, development, implementation, and providing a research agenda for Anticipatory Governance Systems. Implications for systemic and institutional innovation in public management are discussed, indicating that evolving these frameworks could strengthen complex decision-making around public policies and investments in strategic S&T areas involving multiple stakeholders in Foresight and Policy Design, particularly those addressing pressing societal challenges.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102758,"Panizzon, Mateus; Janissek-Muniz, Raquel"

Spatial Decision Support Systems: Three decades on,2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.1339095731217975,"This paper uses a bibliometric approach to examine the growth of and changes in the Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) field over the past three decades. Bibliographic databases such as Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus provide valuable information on academic disciplines as they contain both the articles published and the articles cited. The articles published, and the disciplinary categorization of where they are published, are indicative of the changing disciplinary balance in SDSS, while the citation links of these papers illustrate the intellectual structure of the field. The analysis shows that despite conceptual links rooted in DSS, the field of SDSS developed largely independently from DSS, with little interaction between both. This is surprising, given the growing importance of spatial applications in DSS and an overlapping interest in business analytics and big data space-time analytics. The paper argues for greater interest in SDSS developments in the DSS field, including emergency response SDSS and public participation SDSS, as two forms of SDSS which extend DSS.",10.1016/j.dss.2018.10.010,"Keenan, Peter Bernard; Jankowski, Piotr"
Performance assessment and major trends in open government data research based on Web of Science data,2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.1517445733422696,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the global progress and explore research areas and development trends of open government data (OGD) field from the Web of Science (WOS) database by applying the bibliometric visualization approach. Design/methodology/approach This paper conducted a bibliometric mapping study on OGD scientific research publications based on WOS from six aspects. Findings There are six research perspectives on OGD research. European countries and developed countries pay more attention to OGD movement. The 20 most cited and highly influential research documents were identified. What’s more, the analysis of journals level highlights the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary characteristics of OGD research. Current six research topics for OGD research that have been formed and two major emerging research priorities in OGD research fields were identified. Research limitations/implications The limitation is that data retrieval result which decided to include only 180 publications in the WOS-indexed publications produced a bias against research publications published in non-WOS publication sources. A fuller research trend would be obtained with the more extensively used electronic databases. Practical implications By dint of bibliometric analysis, this paper may be able to quantify research patterns on OGD, to analyze what has been done in this field and to identify the main research hotspots. Therefore, it can aid academic researchers and practicing professionals in contributing to the field more effectively and advancing scientific progress in the field of OGD research. Social implications The results can also promote the study on OGD movement in academia, government and industry and also enrich the theory of OGD and provide some new perspectives for research on OGD.

Open government data (OGD) in six Middle East countries: an evaluation of the national open data portals,2018,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.17782859519775646,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to do provide an overview of open government data (OGD) frameworks in six Middle East countries (Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon and Jordan) and to underscore the barriers in using the open data sets. Design/methodology/approach OGD framework offered by Sieber and Johnson (2015) is deployed for the present purpose. Primarily, documentary analysis is being used for substantiating the study and the national portals of the six countries are investigated. Findings In line with the frameworks chosen for this study, OGD initiatives across the six Middle East countries are at an emerging phase. All the six countries qualify for the “data over the wall” model as advanced by Sieber and Johnson (2015), wherein there are basic provisions of “data aggregation.” Furthermore, the data are incomplete and outdated, which serve as barriers in using these data sets for analysis and interpretation. Therefore, there are a number of barriers in using the open data sets. However, there are many prospects for using these data sets which would improve public accountability and transparency in the long run. Practical implications Besides helping in improved decision-making, the governments may be in a better position to appreciate the relevance of adopting a robust OGD initiative in facilitating the economic growth of their country. Social implications This study is relevant for ensuring that citizen engagement is promoted and there is co-creation of public value. Originality/value Hitherto, OGD has been investigated in the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) but the other countries in Middle East have not been investigated. This study selects six countries outside the GCC ambit and investigates the nature and scope of OGD initiatives in each of them apart from underlining the barriers in using the open data sets.",10.1108/DPRG-10-2017-0055,"Saxena, Stuti"

We used data-driven approaches integrating network and natural language processing techniques on 41 innovation core and ancillary journals to characterize the IR landscape. Contrary to previous efforts, we explored knowledge in the whole IR field from general and specific patterns of growth and interaction using cluster-and term-based data and macro-and micro-level perspectives, respectively. Our results helped us uncover the changing features of the IR landscape in recent years: (i) a strong move into social-and sustainability-driven innovation; (ii) the merging of products and services into business model innovation; (iii) the more influential role of stakeholders such as the government and the general public; (iv) the use of global analytical perspectives while considering local contexts; (v) the importance of greater visions “pulling” innovation; (vi) the greater role of “soft” issues such as behaviors; and (vi) a shift into sectoral, geographical, and methodological diversification. Building on these aspects, we developed an emerging model for future innovation research and a series of IR propositions.

Reflections on JIC’s twenty-year history and suggestions for future IC research,2020,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.31122025419354565,"Purpose The threefold purpose of this paper is to reflect on the evolution and transformation of the Journal of Intellectual Capital (JIC) over the past 20 years, to project its future research directions, and, finally, to propose an IC ecosystem. Design/methodology/approach We adopted a combination of a narrative and a systematic review of 700 JIC papers appearing in the journal in its entirety, from Volume 1 (2000) to Volume 20 (2019). The categorization of topics is based on the frequency of keywords in the titles of the papers. Findings Scholars have proposed four stages of intellectual capital (IC) research: definition/awareness, measurement/management, implementation/strategy, and ecosystem. Over the past 20 years, a total of 16 special issues were published in the journal. The five topics with the highest paper counts in descending order are country-specific studies, concept papers, reporting and disclosure, measurement and performance. Four issues require the researcher’s special attention: theoretical development, IC research methodology, national intellectual capital, and data collection. An IC ecosystem is proposed to invite discussion and refinement. For future research, ecosystem-oriented and interdisciplinary research are suggested. Research design aimed at achieving Sustainable Development Goals are encouraged. Research limitations/implications Intellectual capital research has implications for four major types of stakeholders, namely academia, government agencies, practitioners, and top management team of organizations. The major limitation of this research is that this review of twenty years of intellectual capital research is limited exclusively to the papers published in the JIC; IC papers published in relevant journals or conferences were not included. Originality/value This paper presents a comprehensive review of the articles published in the first 20 volumes of the JIC. The field of intellectual capital has evolved from the social construction of IC knowledge to IC knowledge diffusion and inheritance. Hopefully, a fully developed IC ecosystem will eventually emerge.

The aim is to understand which aspects of these two forms of environmental financing - Green Loans and Sustainability-Linked Loans the existing research have been analyzed. Using content analysis, we conducted a thorough literature review of academic studies. The most intriguing finding from our work is that the provision and adoption of environmental credit products has preceded the implementation of precise legislation to mitigate risks such as greenwashing. Moreover, our findings prove that most research focuses on strategy and performance while only one study covers the aspects related to organization. This research could prove to be a valuable resource for regulators, academics, and banks by providing a comprehensive and precise overview of the work done so far, highlighting the objectives, methodologies, and results achieved.",10.1016/j.qref.2024.101955,"Murè, P.; Giorgio, S.; Antonelli, V.; Bittucci, L."
"Proprietary data, open data, data commons: Who owns the data? How to best reconcile conflicting interests in exploiting the value of data and protecting against its risks",2025,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"The European data strategy aims to make the EU a leader in a data-driven world. To this aim, the EU is creating a single market for data where 1) data can flow across sectors for the benefit of all; 2) European laws like data protection and competition law are fully respected; and 3) the rules for access and use of data are fair, practical and clear. In order to structure the corresponding initiatives of legislators and public authorities, it is important to clarify the data ownership models on which the initiatives are based: Proprietary data models, open data models or so-called data commons models. Based on a literature analysis, this article first provides an overview of the discussed economic and social advantages and disadvantages of proprietary and open data models and, against this background, clarifies the concept of the data commons. In doing so, this article understands the data commons concept to mean that everyone has an equal right in principle to exploit the value of data and control its associated risks. Based on this understanding, purely technical power of the data holder to exclude others from “her” data does not mean that she has a superior or even exclusive right to generate value from the data. By means of legal mechanisms, the competent legislator or public authorities may therefore counteract such purely de facto powers of data holders by opening their technical access control over data for other parties and define the conditions of its use. In doing so, the interests of the data holder in keeping the data for themselves must be weighed up against the interests of data users in using the data as well as the interests in controlling the related risks of all parties affected by this use. While this balancing exercise may be established, in a more or less general manner, by the European or national legislator or even by municipalities, data intermediaries will have to play a central role in ensuring that this balancing of interest is resolved in specific cases. Data intermediaries may do this not only by specifying the general data usage rules provided by the legislators and municipalities in the form of context-specific access and use conditions but above all by monitoring compliance with these conditions.",10.1016/j.clsr.2025.106214,"Kruse, Luisa; von Grafenstein, Max"
Topic modeling to discover the thematic structure and spatial-temporal patterns of building renovation and adaptive reuse in cities,2019,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7239918462934415,"Building alteration and redevelopment play a central role in the revitalization of developed cities, where the scarcity of available land limits the construction of new buildings. The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts. Our machine learning methodology can assist cities to better monitor building alteration activity, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of redevelopment, and more fully understand the economic, social, and environmental implications of changes to the urban built environment.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101383,"Lai, Yuan; Kontokosta, Constantine E."

National information consumption demonstration city construction and urban green development: A quasi-experiment from Chinese cities,2024,-1,Outliers,0.09219111913999692,"Modern cities are the primary sources of carbon dioxide and pollutant emissions, and information technology is a crucial component of city development. To promote the dispersion of information consumption, China constructed an information consumption demonstration city (ICDC) in 2015; however, the impact of ICDC policies on green city development remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore the impact of ICDC policies on city-level carbon dioxide and pollutant emissions. Based on panel data of 204 cities in China from 2010 to 2019, a quasi-experiment method was adopted to evaluate the effects of the ICDC policy on CO2 and SO2 emissions using a difference-in-differences model. The results indicated a significant effect of ICDC policies on green development, reducing urban CO2 and SO2 growth rates by 36% and 31%, respectively. This conclusion was validated using several robustness tests. The mechanism analysis revealed that ICDC policies increased government spending on science and technology, reduced passenger traffic volumes, and promoted the city's digital finance development but had a negative impact on innovative research and development.

Identifying challenges to smart buildings adoption in developing countries. The case of the Algerian context,2025,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.3555251315970729,"Smart buildings have developed significantly over the past four decades, leading to their greater adoption in developed countries. However, several challenges to their adoption persist, especially in developing countries. In Algeria, the concept “smart buildings” remains relatively new. Therefore, building professionals often find themselves hampered by numerous challenges when attempting to adopt smart buildings. This paper aims to identify the key challenges to smart building adoption in Algeria, classifying them into technical, economic, regulatory, and social challenges. Additionally, it evaluates the significance of these challenges based on the insights of experienced industry professionals. To achieve the purpose of this research, an exploratory approach was conducted, consisting of two main components: first, identifying challenges through a comprehensive literature review, and second, ranking these challenges based on a quantitative questionnaire survey conducted with 89 Algerian building professionals. A subgroup analysis was also performed to examine variations in perceptions among respondents. The findings revealed 24 key challenges, with the most critical being the absence of conceptual guidelines or frameworks, infrastructure deficiencies, lack of an action plan, complexity of smart building systems, lack of skilled professionals, and high construction costs. Additionally, respondents’ experience and organization type significantly influenced their perceptions of these challenges. This study provides a systematic and localized understanding of the main challenges to smart buildings adoption in Algeria. Its findings can assist building professionals in addressing these challenges, ultimately supporting the wider implementation of smart buildings in the future. Finally, this research concludes that establishing clear guidelines, along with their concrete implementation, is essential. Additionally, proposed strategies include government financial incentives for stakeholders, professional training programs, public–private partnerships between the government and private companies, and strengthened collaborations between academic institutions and companies are crucial to overcoming these challenges.",10.1016/j.enbuild.2025.115893,"Aribi, Asma; Anouche, Karima"

"Socio-technical imaginaries of a circular economy in governmental discourse and among science, technology, and innovation actors: A Norwegian case study",2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.5098747862908548,"A growing body of research is investigating the connections between the discursive construction of circular economy (CE) and its influences on public policies that promote the socio-technological transition towards circular production and consumption systems. However, surprisingly little attention has focused on how CE discourses interact with science, technology, and innovation (ST&I) actors. To address this gap, this research adopts the prism of socio-technical imaginaries to understand specific visions of circularity in science and innovation, exploring how competing imaginaries mobilize specific actors, institutions, and visions of a greener future. Our empirical material included archival documentation from the Norwegian government and funded research projects on CE. Our analysis identified two key tension points within these imaginaries: “International drivers versus regional and local transition arenas” and “Ecological modernization versus sectoral transformation.” We suggest that tensions are inherent in CE socio-technical imaginaries but are often silenced or minimized by institutional discourses on circularity. Our findings suggest that official CE policy programs tend to minimize or overtly ignore criticisms and contestation that are increasingly raised in academic circles. Our findings indicate the need for increased involvement of ST&I actors and other societal actors (such as NGOs and the private sector) in the CE policymaking process to avoid endless growth as an unexpected CE policy outcome.",10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121903,"Hermann, Roberto Rivas; Pansera, Mario; Nogueira, Leticia Antunes; Monteiro, Marko"
A shallow defence of a technocracy of artificial intelligence: Examining the political harms of algorithmic governance in the domain of government,2020,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be superior to human decision-making in certain areas. This is particularly the case whenever there is a need for advanced strategic reasoning and analysis of vast amounts of data in order to solve complex problems. Few human activities fit this description better than politics. In politics we deal with some of the most complex issues humans face, short-term and long-term consequences have to be balanced, and we make decisions knowing that we do not fully understand their consequences. I examine an extreme case of the application of AI in the domain of government, and use this case to examine a subset of the potential harms associated with algorithmic governance. I focus on five objections based on political theoretical considerations and the potential political harms of an AI technocracy. These are objections based on the ideas of ‘political man’ and participation as a prerequisite for legitimacy, the non-morality of machines and the value of transparency and accountability. I conclude that these objections do not successfully derail AI technocracy, if we make sure that mechanisms for control and backup are in place, and if we design a system in which humans have control over the direction and fundamental goals of society. Such a technocracy, if the AI capabilities of policy formation here assumed becomes reality, may, in theory, provide us with better means of participation, legitimacy, and more efficient government.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101283,"Sætra, Henrik Skaug"

However, there is currently no clear evidence linking the elements of the cyber-physical social system (CPSS) within the conceptual scopes of the bioeconomy. So, this study explores the convergence between digital technologies and the conceptual elements of bioeconomy. Firstly, independent literature reviews were conducted using Biblioshiny, VOSviewer, QDA Miner and WordStat to (i) define the core terms in the scope of bioeconomy concepts and (ii) map the digital technologies. Secondly, we coded and analyzed the literature content with QDA Miner and WordStat to examine the co-occurrence of digital technologies and the conceptual elements of the bioeconomy. The results indicate that the Biomass-Based Bioeconomy (BmBB), Biotechnology-Based Bioeconomy (BtBB), and Biosphere-Based Bioeconomy (BsBB) possess distinct clusters of conceptual elements but also integrative domains, like metabolism. Our findings reveal that digital technologies within categories of data science and analytics, computing and software, and imaging and sensing have been the most prevalent in the bioeconomy context. Evidence has surfaced regarding the interactions between the bioeconomy concepts and digital technologies, illustrating the role of digitization in enhancing data collection, storage, processing and communication across various aspects of the bioeconomy. This evidence underscores the potential of digitalization for a comprehensive measure of the bioeconomy. Ultimately, this research provides valuable insights for improving bioeconomy assessment and supports sustainability goals by integrating emerging digital technologies with the bioeconomy development.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2025.103101,"Leavy, Sebastián; Allegretti, Gabriela; Presotto, Elen; Montoya, Marco Antonio; Talamini, Edson"
Integrating Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) with BIM for infrastructure,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Modular construction is gaining global attention to address infrastructure productivity and sustainability issues. However, its adoption faces challenges due to complex design coordination and process management. Researchers recognised that integrating Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) with Building Information Modelling (BIM) can overcome these obstacles. Despite the potential, the literature on DfMA-BIM integration is fragmented and limitedly researched. Adopting the PRISMA methodology, this paper conducted a systematic literature review from 2012 to 2023 to reveal the global status of DfMA and BIM research, drivers and barriers to DfMA-BIM integration, their impact on carbon reduction and future research direction. The findings underscore that government policy is a primary driver for DfMA-BIM research globally, with three major barriers to DfMA-BIM integration: incomplete regulations, skill/knowledge shortage, and cultural resistance. The fragmented nature of the current research was evidenced by the Odds Ratio of 0.397, highlighting the need for more inter-connected research for DfMA-BIM integration.",10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105705,"Widanage, Chathuri; Kim, Ki Pyung"
Sentiment analysis and its applications in fighting COVID-19 and infectious diseases: A systematic review,2021,-1,Outliers,0.2788921337978482,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 occurred unexpectedly in China in December 2019. Tens of millions of confirmed cases and more than hundreds of thousands of confirmed deaths are reported worldwide according to the World Health Organisation. News about the virus is spreading all over social media websites. Consequently, these social media outlets are experiencing and presenting different views, opinions and emotions during various outbreak-related incidents. For computer scientists and researchers, big data are valuable assets for understanding people’s sentiments regarding current events, especially those related to the pandemic. Therefore, analysing these sentiments will yield remarkable findings. To the best of our knowledge, previous related studies have focused on one kind of infectious disease. No previous study has examined multiple diseases via sentiment analysis. Accordingly, this research aimed to review and analyse articles about the occurrence of different types of infectious diseases, such as epidemics, pandemics, viruses or outbreaks, during the last 10 years, understand the application of sentiment analysis and obtain the most important literature findings. Articles on related topics were systematically searched in five major databases, namely, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and Scopus, from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2020. These indices were considered sufficiently extensive and reliable to cover our scope of the literature. Articles were selected based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review, with a total of n = 28 articles selected. All these articles were formed into a coherent taxonomy to describe the corresponding current standpoints in the literature in accordance with four main categories: lexicon-based models, machine learning-based models, hybrid-based models and individuals. The obtained articles were categorised into motivations related to disease mitigation, data analysis and challenges faced by researchers with respect to data, social media platforms and community. Other aspects, such as the protocol being followed by the systematic review and demographic statistics of the literature distribution, were included in the review. Interesting patterns were observed in the literature, and the identified articles were grouped accordingly.

Which technology to which challenge in democratic governance? An approach using design science research,2021,-1,Outliers,0.10470706654444949,"Purpose Information systems (IS) play an important role in contemporary society, but critical questions remain on their potential use and impact on democracy. This study aims to contribute to the discussion on which technology can be adequate to which major challenge of democratic governance, through the identification and pairing of challenges of democratic governance with specific information technologies with the potential to be used in applications related to this challenge. This perspective can be considered positioned in the confluence between IS, political science and public administration. Design/methodology/approach Design science research, a research approach in IS, was used. The suggestion of a conceptual framework with pairs of challenges in democratic governance and information technologies was initially developed. In a subsequent phase, this framework was discussed and assessed through interviews with a panel of selected experts in e-government and IS, reaching a revised conceptual framework. Findings Results suggest that the conceptual pairing of challenges in democratic governance with IS’s solutions such as artificial intelligence, systems integration or blockchain technologies, for instance, if used in a critical, transparent and accountable way, can play a role in capacitating the delivery of better public services and contribute to encouraging citizen trust and political participation. These results may contribute to open a methodological agenda dedicated to the selection of adequate IS resources to address specific challenges of democratic governance, as well as to help in the development of public policies in the area. Originality/value Previous studies on digital government offer important insights on the impact of information and communication technologies-enabled public governance tools for government openness, public service efficiency and user-friendliness, and for citizen political participation and societal mobilization. But the literature still lacks a systematic conceptual framework mapping and assessing the role of distinctive IS instruments in democratic challenge-solving and specifying functional relationships between specific technology and democratic outcomes.

An Open Data Repository for Engineering Design: Using Text Mining with Open Government Data,2022,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.19303093776990132,"Engineering Design (ED) is a complex process in which the reuse of knowledge is crucial: applying the knowledge consolidated in previous design activities to future design activities means performing them in a better way. The relevance of data in ED is even more crucial in a business context in which Data Science (DS) is literally revolutionizing the way companies operate and therefore also the way data are analyzed. Despite having been recognized as crucial for ED processes, data still remain closed in the domain and accessible only to their owners due to several constraints related to the private and proprietary nature of the acquired data. An answer to these challenges could be found in Open Data, but at the state of the art an operational Engineering Design framework to embrace them is still far to be achieved by both academia and industry. Given these issues, the aim of this paper is to give evidence that Text Mining can help to make a complex open database more effective to be used for the ED process, taking U.S. Open Government Data (OGD) repository as a case study. Open access to methods and data used within this research is provided. The results of this study allow us to understand for which purposes it is possible to apply the datasets and to comprehend the expertise and the data science methods needed for processing different data formats.

Digital Health Policy and Programs for Hospital Care in Vietnam: Scoping Review,2022,-1,Outliers,0.14007486689568485,"Background There are a host of emergent technologies with the potential to improve hospital care in low- and middle-income countries such as Vietnam. Wearable monitors and artificial intelligence–based decision support systems could be integrated with hospital-based digital health systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) to provide higher level care at a relatively low cost. However, the appropriate and sustainable application of these innovations in low- and middle-income countries requires an understanding of the local government’s requirements and regulations such as technology specifications, cybersecurity, data-sharing protocols, and interoperability. Objective This scoping review aims to explore the current state of digital health research and the policies that govern the adoption of digital health systems in Vietnamese hospitals. Methods We conducted a scoping review using a modification of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for academic publications, and Thư Viện Pháp Luật, a proprietary database of Vietnamese government documents, and the Vietnam Electronic Health Administration website were searched for government documents. Google Scholar and Google Search were used for snowballing searches. The sources were assessed against predefined eligibility criteria through title, abstract, and full-text screening. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The review process was primarily undertaken by one researcher and reviewed by another researcher during each step. Results In total, 11 academic publications and 20 government documents were included in this review. Among the academic studies, 5 reported engineering solutions for information systems in hospitals, 2 assessed readiness for EHR implementation, 1 tested physicians’ performance before and after using clinical decision support software, 1 reported a national laboratory information management system, and 2 reviewed the health system’s capability to implement eHealth and artificial intelligence. Of the 20 government documents, 19 were promulgated from 2013 to 2020. These regulations and guidance cover a wide range of digital health domains, including hospital information management systems, general and interoperability standards, cybersecurity in health organizations, conditions for the provision of health information technology (HIT), electronic health insurance claims, laboratory information systems, HIT maturity, digital health strategies, electronic medical records, EHRs, and eHealth architectural frameworks. Conclusions Research about hospital-based digital health systems in Vietnam is very limited, particularly implementation studies. Government regulations and guidance for HIT in health care organizations have been released with increasing frequency since 2013, targeting a variety of information systems such as electronic medical records, EHRs, and laboratory information systems. In general, these policies were focused on the basic specifications and standards that digital health systems need to meet. More research is needed in the future to guide the implementation of digital health care systems in the Vietnam hospital setting.",10.2196/32392,"Tran, Duc Minh; Thwaites, C Louise; Van Nuil, Jennifer Ilo; McKnight, Jacob; Luu, An Phuoc; Paton, Chris"

Identifying the value of data analytics in the context of government supervision: Insights from the customs domain,2021,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"eCommerce, Brexit, new safety and security concerns are only a few examples of the challenges that government organisations, in particular customs administrations, face today when controlling goods crossing borders. To deal with the enormous volumes of trade customs administrations rely more and more on information technology (IT) and risk assessment, and are starting to explore the possibilities that data analytics (DA) can offer to support their supervision tasks. Driven by customs as our empirical domain, we explore the use of DA to support the supervision role of government. Although data analytics is considered to be a technological breakthrough, there is so far only a limited understanding of how governments can translate this potential into actual value and what are barriers and trade-offs that need to be overcome to lead to value realisation. The main question that we explore in this paper is: How to identify the value of DA in a government supervision context, and what are barriers and trade-offs to be considered and overcome in order to realise this value? Building on leading models from the information system (IS) literature, and by using case studies from the customs domain, we developed the Value of Data Analytics in Government Supervision (VDAGS) framework. The framework can help managers and policy-makers to gain a better understanding of the benefits and trade-offs of using DA when developing DA strategies or when embarking on new DA projects. Future research can examine the applicability of the VDAGS framework in other domains of government supervision.",10.1016/j.giq.2020.101496,"Rukanova, Boriana; Tan, Yao-Hua; Slegt, Micha; Molenhuis, Marcel; van Rijnsoever, Ben; Migeotte, Jonathan; Labare, Mathieu L.M.; Plecko, Krunoslav; Caglayan, Bora; Shorten, Gavin; van der Meij, Otis; Post, Suzanne"
"Blockchain in the built environment and construction industry: A systematic review, conceptual models and practical use cases",2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7703657107716412,"The construction industry is facing many challenges including low productivity, poor regulation and compliance, lack of adequate collaboration and information sharing, and poor payment practices. Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.",10.1016/j.autcon.2019.02.005,"Li, Jennifer; Greenwood, David; Kassem, Mohamad"

Mapping the empirical literature of the GDPR's (In-)effectiveness: A systematic review,2025,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"In the realm of data protection, a striking disconnect prevails between traditional domains of doctrinal, legal, theoretical, and policy-based inquiries and a burgeoning body of empirical evidence. Much of the scholarly and regulatory discourse remains entrenched in abstract legal principles or normative frameworks, leaving the empirical landscape uncharted or minimally engaged. Since the birth of EU data protection law, a modest body of empirical evidence has been generated but remains widely scattered and unexamined. Such evidence offers vital insights into the effectiveness of data protection measures but languishes on the periphery, inadequately integrated into the broader conversation. To make a meaningful connection, we conduct a comprehensive review and synthesis of empirical research spanning nearly three decades (1995 - March 2022), advocating for a more robust integration of empirical evidence into the evaluation and review of the GDPR while laying a methodological foundation for coordinated research. By categorising evidence into four distinct groups– Awareness and Trust, Operational Performance, Ripple Effect, and Normative Clarity, we provide a structured analysis therein and highlight the variety and nuances of the empirical evidence produced about the GDPR. Our discussion offers critical reflections on the current orientations and designs of evaluation work, challenging some popular but misguided orientations that significantly influence public debate and even direction of empirical and doctrinal research. This synthesis also sheds light on several understated aspects, surfaced by our systematic review, including the complex structure of the GDPR and the internal contradictions between components, the GDPR's interaction with other normative values and legal frameworks, as well as unintended consequences imposed by the GDPR on other values not explicitly recognised as regulatory objectives (such as innovation). We further propose a methodological improvement in how empirical evidence can be generated and utilised, stressing the need for more guided, coordinated and rigorous empirical research. By re-aligning empirical focus towards these ends and establishing strategic coordination at the community level, we seek to inform and underpin evaluative work that aligns empirical inquiries with policy and doctrinal needs, while truly reflecting the complexities and challenges of safeguarding personal data in the digital age.",10.1016/j.clsr.2025.106129,"Li, Wenlong; Li, Zihao; Li, Wenkai; Zhang, Yueming; Li, Aolan"
Intellectual capital between measurement and reporting: a structured literature review,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.26385616000779993,"Purpose In the past decade, intellectual capital (IC) measurement and reporting have been feeding scientific debate; however, only few studies address these issues together. The present research aims to provide an integrated view of the topics covered by the existing literature and to highlight the emerging research trends and set the agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach This study develops a structured literature review (SLR) of the extant research concerned with IC measurement and reporting, using a comprehensive sample of 1,021 articles extracted from the Scopus database. Findings The findings of the SLR show that the existing literature focuses on seven research areas: IC and public sector; IC university and education; IC evaluation method; internal and external IC disclosure; IC and CSR; management of IC in organizations; other. Overall, findings indicate that IC measurement and reporting are highly researched topics that continue to attract the interests of scholars. Finally, the SLR analysis has allowed outlining a future research agenda, with particular reference to the IC evaluation method and internal and external IC disclosure research areas. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of this research lies in the manual screening of relevant studies, which entails some degree of subjectivity. Furthermore, another limitation research could be considered the use of a single database (Scopus). Originality/value The present study brings potential contributions for scholars and practitioners. From a scholarly perspective, the paper provides a systematization of scientific contributions that have dealt with IC measurement and reporting.

Smart-sustainability: A new urban fix?,2019,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Urban policy increasingly positions smart urban development as a transformative approach to deliver sustainability. In this paper, we question the transformative credentials of smartness and argue that it is better understood as a partial fix for the economic, environmental and social challenges faced by cities. Drawing on the urban sustainability and smart city literatures, we develop the concept of the urban smart-sustainability fix. This concept focuses on how smart-sustainable city initiatives selectively integrate digital and environmental agendas via entrepreneurial forms of urban governance. We develop this concept by examining how the urban smart-sustainability fix is constructed in the European Commission’s flagship smart cities and communities lighthouse projects, focusing on the Triangulum initiative. Our research reveals three elements of the urban smart-sustainability fix: (1) the spatial development of smart-sustainable districts; (2) the digitisation of urban infrastructure to reveal hidden processes; and, (3) collaborative experimentation with low-carbon and digital technologies. We argue that this has produced urban districts that are attempting to reduce their carbon emissions while promoting green economic growth. The main aim of the urban smart-sustainability fix is to make the urban realm more manageable resulting in amplification, rather than transformation, of the dominant ecological modernisation agenda of sustainable development.",10.1016/j.scs.2018.11.028,"Martin, Christopher; Evans, James; Karvonen, Andrew; Paskaleva, Krassimira; Yang, Dujuan; Linjordet, Trond"
Governance of artificial intelligence: A risk and guideline-based integrative framework,2022,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"This study addresses the growing challenge of governing artificial intelligence (AI) arising from the risks that it increasingly poses to the public sector and society. Based on an in-depth literature analysis, we first identify AI risks and guidelines and classify them into six categories, including technological, data, and analytical risks and guidelines, informational and communicational risks and guidelines, economic risks and guidelines, social risks and guidelines, ethical risks and guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory risks and guidelines. These risks and guidelines are then elaborated and transferred into a four-layered conceptual framework for AI governance. The framework interrelates AI risks and AI guidelines by means of a risk management and guidance process, resulting in an AI governance layer depicting the process for implementation of customised risk mitigation guidelines. The framework constitutes a comprehensive reference point for developing and implementing AI governance strategies and measures in the public sector.",10.1016/j.giq.2022.101685,"Wirtz, Bernd W.; Weyerer, Jan C.; Kehl, Ines"

Continual usage intention of platform-based governance services: A study from an emerging economy,2022,-1,Outliers,0.1335163459918265,"Several emerging economies have embarked on a path of digitization to provide lean governance through platform-based applications. Platforms and ecosystems can play vital roles in the proliferation of technologies, which can facilitate a digital transformation of society aimed at equitable and efficient service delivery to citizens. Despite being innovative, citizen-centric, and citizen-inclusive, such platforms has been observed to be rare in emerging economies. Our study assesses the factors that lead to the intention to continue to use these platforms, with the objective of establishing a revised approach to better governance through these platform-based services. A conceptual framework is proposed, based on an integration of various models, and tested using primary data from citizens subscribing to platform-based government services. The results indicate that a continuous availability of such services has better predictive power for the continual-use intention. A unique contribution of the study worth highlighting is the significance of the factor, “sovereign structural assurance,” a pre-requisite for strengthening the degree of control. Based on this study's findings, it is recommended that platforms should invest in controls for structural assurance. These interventions can serve as contrivances that create a sustainable model for such services. A successful convergence of the factors would accelerate the government services by transforming the public service landscape.",10.1016/j.giq.2021.101651,"Upadhyay, Parijat; Kumar, Anup; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Adlakha, Amit"
A portfolio selection of internet of things (IoTs) applications for the sustainable urban transportation: A novel hybrid multi criteria decision making approach,2023,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.3095381530223108,"The nature of technological innovations is unpredictable, therefore decision making on disruptive technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) in many public sector organizations is undisciplined. Due to resource limitations and tremendous payoffs, there is a need to have a decision-making framework to manage technological innovations as a portfolio of investments that balances risk and reward simultaneously. This study provides a new portfolio matrix for decision making to identify IoT applications in the urban transportation sector for future investment based on two dimensions of impact on sustainable development (SD) and feasibility for implementing IoT using a novel hybrid multi criteria decision making approach. For this purpose, seventeen IoT applications in urban transportation were identified using a systematic literature review. The improved Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) - Best Worth Method (BWM) method was used to determine the relationship between SD criteria and IoT challenges, and to calculate their importance. Then, the Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) method was used to prioritize the IoT applications based on SD criteria and IoT challenges. Finally, the adapted impact-feasibility matrix was used to simultaneously evaluate both criteria for selecting the IoT applications portfolio.

What's next for responsible artificial intelligence: a way forward through responsible innovation,2023,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Industry is adopting artificial intelligence (AI) at a rapid pace and a growing number of countries have declared national AI strategies. However, several spectacular AI failures have led to ethical concerns about responsibility in AI development and use, which gave rise to the emerging field of responsible AI (RAI). The field of responsible innovation (RI) has a longer history and evolved toward a framework for the entire research, development, and innovation life cycle. However, this research demonstrates that the uptake of RI by RAI has been slow. RAI has been developing independently, with three times the number of publications than RI. The objective and knowledge contribution of this research was to understand how RAI has been developing independently from RI and contribute to how RI could be leveraged toward the progression of RAI in a causal loop diagram. It is concluded that stakeholder engagement of citizens from diverse cultures across the Global North and South is a policy leverage point for moving the RI adoption by RAI toward global best practice. A role-specific recommendation for policy makers is made to deploy modes of engaging with the Global South with more urgency to avoid the risk of harming vulnerable populations. As an additional methodological contribution, this study employs a novel method, systematic science mapping, which combines systematic literature reviews with science mapping. This new method enabled the discovery of an emerging ‘axis of adoption’ of RI by RAI around the thematic areas of ethics, governance, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability. 828 Scopus articles were mapped for RI and 2489 articles were mapped for RAI. The research presented here is by any measure the largest systematic literature review of both fields to date and the only cross-disciplinary review from a methodological perspective.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14379,"Herrmann, Heinz"

Prospects of open government data (OGD) in facilitating the economic diversification of GCC region,2017,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.1509450973065522,"Purpose As the ongoing oil prices’ crisis is emerging as a major cause of concern for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, the constituent governments are attempting at undertaking measures of economic diversification to attain long-term sustainability. The author posits that open government data (OGD) has a significant role to play in facilitating the economic turnaround of the GCC region, given that OGD promotes innovation and economic growth besides providing avenues for collaboration and participation among different stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach Following a structured literature review, the paper scans literature on OGD followed by providing a typology of countries on the basis of their OGD-adherence (“laggard”, “caged”, “forerunner” and “champ”). This is followed by a discussion on the ongoing oil prices’ crisis, and evidentiary support is lent by examples from the OGD portals of each of the six GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) to provide indicators as to how a robust OGD implementation may support their economic diversification objectives. Findings Although the present OGD framework of the GCC is relatively weak, it is asserted that OGD has immense potential in facilitating the economic diversification initiatives of the GCC countries. Therefore, the GCC needs to strategize upon institutionalization of their OGD initiatives for realizing their “vision” and goals of economic diversification to result in an economic turnaround effectively. Originality/value Besides providing a typology of countries as OGD-adherents and categorizing GCC as “forerunner(s)” on the basis of the typology, the originality of the study lies in its attempt to answer the research question: “what is the role of the OGD in facilitating the economic diversification of the GCC?” Conceding that the research on OGD in the GCC context is few and far between, the present study is a significant contribution to the extant literature pertaining to the roll-out of OGD in developing countries.",10.1108/ILS-04-2017-0023,"Saxena, Stuti"

Dynamic digital capabilities and supply chain resilience: The role of government effectiveness,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Organizations in recent times are increasingly investing in building supply chain resilience following disruptions due to natural disasters, geo-political crises, and pandemics. A lack of government support has exacerbated the disruption to supply chains in some regions of the world. The positive influence of digitalization on social inclusion, government accountability, and creating a more open environment is well understood. Despite this, different countries have shown varying degrees of digital responsiveness during the pandemic as they attempted to deal with the effects of various COVID strains. The influence of government policies on the supply chain has not been examined in the literature so far and, hence, to address this research gap, we examine the interaction effect of government support effectiveness i.e., tax credits, interest deferral, digital investment, soft loans on dynamic capabilities i.e., digital adaptabilities and digital agilities and on supply chain resilience, using a multi-method approach. To understand how digital adaptability and agility improve supply chain resilience, we conducted 13 semi-structured interviews. Additionally, we pretested our measurement instrument using qualitative semi-structured interviews to validate our hypothesized relationships. We collected data at a specific point of time using a survey-based instrument (N = 203) to address our research questions. Based on data analyses of both the qualitative and survey-based data, our findings indicate that digital adaptability is an important driver of digital agility. Furthermore, the results indicate that government effectiveness is crucial to enhancing supply chain resilience by enhancing digital adaptability and agility. Our research makes some useful contributions to the dynamic capability view by enhancing theoretical understanding, of the role of government in building digital capabilities in uncertain times, to improve supply chain resilience. It also bridges the research gaps between macro and micro perspectives, as identified by management scholars.

Internet Village Motoman Project in rural Cambodia: bridging the digital divide,2018,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.37626044451912183,"Purpose Community wireless networking has become a growing trend in both metropolitan and rural areas around the world. However, few studies have sought to understand what motivates people to use community wireless networks and the unintended effects that those technologies have on communities, particularly for rural users. The purpose of this paper is to explore the benefits and usage of an asynchronous wireless internet system in a rural village of Cambodia to examine the issues and challenges in the acceptance of a new technology in a less-developed country. Design/methodology/approach By employing qualitative methods of in-depth case analysis, the authors revealed various usage motivations and unintended effects of the system. Findings The authors identified five reasons that motivated users to use the system: avowed identity, a means to an end, maintaining personal ties, power and influence, and psychological commitment and ownership. The unintended effects of the system included increased number of interactions among actors and other uses of the system, including internet commerce, telemedicine, and e-government. Research limitations/implications This study explores the wireless internet project known as the “Internet Village Motoman Project” that was initiated by a non-governmental organization with funding from private donors, supplemented with matching funds from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. Originality/value This study contributes to the academic understanding of rural regions of Cambodia and its evidence supports the current theoretical assumptions that user behaviors are not determined only by users’ decisions alone (as proposed by traditional cognitive IS research), but also by users and their social interactions as stated in the four-dimensional social actor framework proposed by Lamb and Kling (2003). The latter provides better explanation of the motivation for internet use in the region. The theoretical contribution of this study is the useful adoption of the actor-network approach in a non-organizational setting. The findings also contribute to the literature on how practical internet engineering can bridge the digital divide.

Isomorphic difference: Familiarity and distinctiveness in national research and innovation policies,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.38687522954564674,"Global research and innovation policies appear remarkably similar on a number of dimensions, including preferred principles of clustering and partnership, an emphasis on research-led growth and a focus on ‘hot topics’ such as nanotechnology and big data. However, policies for this field also reflect deeper-rooted traditions, institutional processes and ways of working: what looks the same can be very different when viewed in context. In this paper, we first consider the evidence for convergence across research and innovation policies before outlining perspectives based on contextual difference. Drawing particularly upon institutional theory, organizational studies and Science & Technology Studies (STS), we introduce the concept of ‘isomorphic difference’ as a means of symmetrically exploring relations of familiarity and distinctiveness.

Open Data Ecosystems (ODE) is an emerging concept for data sharing under public licenses in software ecosystems, similar to Open Source Software (OSS). It has certain similarities to Open Government Data (OGD), where public agencies share data for innovation and transparency. We aimed to explore open data ecosystems involving commercial actors. Thus, we organized five focus groups with 27 practitioners from 22 companies, public organizations, and research institutes. Based on the outcomes, we surveyed three cases of emerging ODE practice to further understand the concepts and to validate the initial findings. The main outcome is an initial conceptual model of ODEs’ value, intrinsics, governance, and evolution, and propositions for practice and further research. We found that ODE must be value driven. Regarding the intrinsics of data, we found their type, meta-data, and legal frameworks influential for their openness. We also found the characteristics of ecosystem initiation, organization, data acquisition and openness be differentiating, which we advise research and practice to take into consideration.",10.1016/j.jss.2021.111088,"Runeson, Per; Olsson, Thomas; Linåker, Johan"
Utilizing predictive modeling to enhance policy and practice through improved identification of at-risk clients: Predicting permanency for foster children,2018,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.421567579375555,"Child welfare agencies are increasingly required to leverage their limited resources to meet nearly limitless demands. As a result, agencies are searching for new opportunities to efficiently improve policy and practice, and advances in data availability and technology have brought increased attention to the utility of predictive modeling. While the literature has often highlighted the considerable potential of predictive models leveraging “big data”, discussions of the methodology and the associated best practices remain critically absent. To address this gap, this paper provides an illustrative case involving the development and testing of models used to predict the probability of whether U.S. foster children would achieve legal permanency. The models were trained and tested using a national administrative dataset of 233,633 foster care children that discharged from state child welfare systems in 2013. The optimal model, a boosted tree, predicted whether children would achieve permanency with 97.66% accuracy.

Governance and the provision of roads and mobility in five Japanese ‘societies’,2023,-1,Outliers,0.5121599896673997,"Roads, and policies relevant to roads, impact on the economy and the environment and have profound impacts on society yet there are few studies of the interaction between civil and civic society covering state formation, transformations to the form of government, the administration of the road sector of the economy, and personal mobility. A conceptual diagram of interactions is presented where, through an historical lens, data from secondary literature and government websites in English and Japanese are interpreted for the five “Societies” identified by the Japanese Government, namely, hunter-gathering, agricultural, industrial, information technological and “Society 5.0”. These data are interrogated through key propositions based on the New Institutional Economics (NIE): the interplay between economic and political markets holds the key to the dynamics of institutional change; transformation occurs over long periods of time, with the dynamics of change in phases; it is people in institutions and organisations who make decisions about what to do when confronted with internal or external pressures for change; it is people who are informed by the circulation of ideas on technologies, policies, services and finance (policy transfer); and judgement on which values govern the decision and in what way do they impact on society. The discussion section uses summary tables that shed light on these propositions. The broad perspective taken suggests that policy objectives change over time in response to emerging problems (both internal and external) and that institutions and organisations also evolve in response to changing circumstances. The conclusions suggest areas for further research.",10.1016/j.cstp.2023.101000,"Black, John A.; Nakanishi, Hitomi; Hassall Kobayashi, Yasuko"
Towards an ‘Ethics of Evidence’: Unsettling knowledge inequalities in urban development practice,2025,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Globally, ‘evidence-based’ approaches within urban development policy and planning are on the rise. However, terms such as data, evidence, research, information, and knowledge are often used interchangeably, which can obscure epistemological differences on the understandings of knowledge. Taking cues from Southern scholars, this article unpacks the epistemological underpinnings which shape how knowledge—and therefore evidence—are understood. To do so, this article focuses on three concepts which have a strong influence on global evidence discourse: objectivity, rigour, and value for money, unsettling their rationalities and manifestations in contemporary urban development practice. This paper argues that the turn towards evidence—while fundamental to addressing global challenges—also embodies many of the characteristics of a ‘boundary concept’, with sufficient interpretive flexibility to foster collaboration across a range of diverse stakeholders, but with risks attached to its conceptual fuzziness. This article concludes by calling for an ‘ethics of evidence’, which challenges the uneven geographies of knowledge, and draws out the implications for an approach to evidence which engages with how urban developmental challenges are understood, measured, and managed.",10.1016/j.wdp.2025.100689,"Butcher, Stephanie; Fattah, Kazi Nazrul; Dam, Jennifer; Marathe, Rewa"
Overcoming barriers to circular economy implementation in the oil & gas industry: Environmental and social implications,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"This anticipated consumer demand has put unprecedented pressure on natural resources. Being the highest contributor in the energy transition, Oil & gas (O&G) industry needs to lessen the negative impact of climate change and natural disasters. To combat the impact of emissions and a move towards circularity, O&G industry has undertaken numerous initiatives including energy efficiency, process fuel improvements, and technological transformation etc. But due to certain barriers O&G industry is unable to embrace Circular Economy (CE) implementation in the firms. Therefore, this study has proposed a model to examine the existing critical barriers and suggest strategies to overcome the barriers. The current study has employed an extensive analysis using a hybrid methodology of Fuzzy-DEMATEL (F-DEMATEL) and Best Worst Method (BWM) for assessing the barriers and ranking the strategies. The results showed that ‘knowledge barriers’ are the most critical in the O&G industry that hampers the implementation of CE currently.

Benchmarking open data efforts through indices and rankings: Assessing development and contexts of use,2022,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.1756640775112216,"This paper aims to provide a broad perspective on the development of benchmarking open data efforts through indices and rankings over the years, both at the level of countries and allowing for a cross-country comparison. The methodology follows a systematic search for the relevant resources, their classification and identification of six open data benchmarks to be further analyzed, the identification of their key components through decomposition, their description, and identifying the similarities and differences. Three major groups of indices and four periods that characterize the efforts to benchmark and measure the development of open data are identified, where the first measure the openness of the selected categories of data, the second focuses on different aspects of the open data ecosystem, using a large number of variables, and the third is a combination of both approaches. Recommendations as well as trends that can form the benchmarking frameworks in the future are also discussed. The findings are of a high importance for individual countries, which allow for correct and accurate interpretation of the results changes in the scope of a given index or rank, i.e., whether the difference in results is the result of national efforts or the subject of changes in the specific index, as well as how to combine and interpret the results of a number of indices for correct decision-making and for the definition of the future actions where the results vary significantly.

"NGOs’ performance, governance, and accountability in the era of digital transformation",2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Digital transformation creates opportunities and challenges for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and their stakeholders. In NGOs, digital transformation affects different accounting modes. While many challenges brought about by digital transformation are universal, NGOs can be acutely affected due to the diversity of their stakeholders, regulatory and funder demands, and ongoing resource constraints. Conversely, there is hope that digital transformation can help to address longstanding sectoral level challenges, and engage those diverse stakeholders with performance, governance and accountability information. This article reviews the existing literature on NGO digital transformation, situates the articles of this Special Issue and identifies avenues for further research. Digital transformation is arguably amplifying existing trends, through helping NGOs discharge greater accountability to beneficiaries, and changing their communications with funders. However, beneficiaries have seldom driven such attempts, and are often not involved in the development of accountability measures nor assessing NGOs’ success. Early attempts to engage beneficiaries are encouraging, but real concerns remain that technology worsens social division and amplifies cleavages, leaving the most vulnerable behind.",10.1016/j.bar.2023.101239,"Cordery, Carolyn J.; Goncharenko, Galina; Polzer, Tobias; McConville, Danielle; Belal, Ataur"
Adoption phases of Green Information Technology in enhanced sustainability: A bibliometric study,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.36811227940721875,"Research related to Green Information Technology (GIT) has been consolidating its pathway in the last two decades, becoming a well-established research stream. Due to increasing interest, there is a necessity for mapping the related scientific production, providing evidence of future work gaps.

Artificial Intelligence–Based Framework for Analyzing Health Care Staff Security Practice: Mapping Review and Simulation Study,2021,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.6107211611372744,"Background Blocklisting malicious activities in health care is challenging in relation to access control in health care security practices due to the fear of preventing legitimate access for therapeutic reasons. Inadvertent prevention of legitimate access can contravene the availability trait of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability triad, and may result in worsening health conditions, leading to serious consequences, including deaths. Therefore, health care staff are often provided with a wide range of access such as a “breaking-the-glass” or “self-authorization” mechanism for emergency access. However, this broad access can undermine the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive health care data because breaking-the-glass can lead to vast unauthorized access, which could be problematic when determining illegitimate access in security practices. Objective A review was performed to pinpoint appropriate artificial intelligence (AI) methods and data sources that can be used for effective modeling and analysis of health care staff security practices. Based on knowledge obtained from the review, a framework was developed and implemented with simulated data to provide a comprehensive approach toward effective modeling and analyzing security practices of health care staff in real access logs. Methods The flow of our approach was a mapping review to provide AI methods, data sources and their attributes, along with other categories as input for framework development. To assess implementation of the framework, electronic health record (EHR) log data were simulated and analyzed, and the performance of various approaches in the framework was compared. Results Among the total 130 articles initially identified, 18 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thorough assessment and analysis of the included articles revealed that K-nearest neighbor, Bayesian network, and decision tree (C4.5) algorithms were predominantly applied to EHR and network logs with varying input features of health care staff security practices. Based on the review results, a framework was developed and implemented with simulated logs. The decision tree obtained the best precision of 0.655, whereas the best recall was achieved by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm at 0.977. However, the best F1-score was obtained by random forest at 0.775. In brief, three classifiers (random forest, decision tree, and SVM) in the two-class approach achieved the best precision of 0.998. Conclusions The security practices of health care staff can be effectively analyzed using a two-class approach to detect malicious and nonmalicious security practices. Based on our comparative study, the algorithms that can effectively be used in related studies include random forest, decision tree, and SVM. Deviations of security practices from required health care staff’s security behavior in the big data context can be analyzed with real access logs to define appropriate incentives for improving conscious care security practice.",10.2196/19250,"Yeng, Prosper Kandabongee; Nweke, Livinus Obiora; Yang, Bian; Ali Fauzi, Muhammad; Snekkenes, Einar Arthur"
A critical review of sustianable refuse-derived fuel production in waste processing facility,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Transformation of municipal solid waste into refuse-derived fuel (RDF) offers a promising solution for waste-to-energy conversion. In this context, a systematic literature review and scientometric analysis is conducted showing refinements in RDF application for energy-from-waste (EfW) initiatives, forging a comprehensive approach to sustainable waste management. Key aspects of EfW projects using RDF are examined, focusing on methodologies for calorific value estimation, waste characterization, quality assessment, and public–private partnerships (PPPs). Emphasis is placed on the necessity of accurate energy potential measurement and advanced characterization techniques, including computer vision, for effective waste sorting and analysis. Quality assessments of RDF are highlighted for their impact on decisions within the biomass fuel supply chain, emphasizing the importance of optimizing energy recovery. PPP’s are identified as key to successful execution of EfW projects, with their roles, trends, and risk modeling crucial for fostering effective collaboration between public and private sectors. The study concludes by identifying research gaps, such as the deficiency of new frameworks to support technical assessments of waste processing facilities for strategic, tactical, and operational improvements. Additionally, RDF applications in EfW are limited because of inconsistent waste sorting, deviation from specifications and environmental regulations.

Measuring the impact of the digital economy in developing countries: A systematic review and meta- analysis,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.5247603249180254,"The digital economy, driven by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), has emerged as a significant contributor to economies worldwide. However, accurately defining and measuring its impact on national economies remains a complex endeavor. This paper explores the definition, measurement, role, and impacts of the digital economy across various economies. It also examines the involvement of governments and telecommunication regulators in assessing the digital economy and identifies future directions for developing countries. A systematic literature review utilizing the PRISMA Model is employed to investigate the factors and indices used to measure the digital economy. The findings highlight ongoing efforts to harmonize the definition and metrics; nonetheless, challenges persist due to the scarcity of appropriate datasets and variations in country-specific definitions. Additionally, the effectiveness of existing digital economy indices and toolkits in assessing the level of digitalization in developing countries is evaluated. The paper concludes that despite ongoing efforts to bridge the gaps, the concept of the digital economy remains defined and measured differently, necessitating a new definition that accounts for various contextual peculiarities. Furthermore, a roadmap is proposed to develop a toolkit that ensures comprehensive measurement, thus preventing an underestimation of the digital economy's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in developing countries. The paper underscores the need for international and multi-stakeholder dialogue to establish a common understanding of the digital economy's definition and measurement. Developing countries, such as Nigeria, are urged to develop or adopt new metrics tailored to their unique circumstances, facilitating an accurate and efficient quantification of the digital economy's impact on crucial indicators like GDP.

Path analysis of influencing government's excessive behavior in PPP project: Based on field dynamic theory,2022,-1,Outliers,0.09426021722643974,"The excessive behavior of the government is a common phenomenon in the practice of PPP projects such as transportation, municipal engineering and environmental governance. Analyzing the excessive behaviors of the government in PPP projects is very important to improve project performance and success. Based on the field dynamic theory, the demand of government and the external environment participating in PPP are the important reasons for excessive behavior. Through literature analysis, 14 government demands and 10 environmental factors that influence the government's excessive behavior are identified, and a hypothesis model of the influencing path of government's excessive behavior is constructed. 166 valid data are collected through a questionnaire survey. Carrying out factor analysis, hypothesis, and path test, the main findings are as follows: Government’s demands are divided into the demand of satisfying public activities, self-interest, responsibility, and relieving financial pressure; External environmental factors are divided into social conditions, department mechanism, and project information; The demand for responsibility plays a restraining role, while the other types of demand are opposite, and these demands play an intermediary role in the impact path of external environment on excessive behavior; Among the environmental factors, only the lack of project information has a direct influence on the government excessive behavior; In the feasibility subsidy project, the risk of excessive behavior is high, especially for transportation projects with certain toll nature.

Digital platform ecosystems: A systemic view of power wielded by the platform orchestrators over complementors,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.3544631189342502,"In the rising shaped-by-platforms landscape, increasing power has been concentrated in the hands of a few dominant digital platform orchestrators. This growing dominance has brought the issue of power asymmetries between platform orchestrators and complementors to the forefront of economic and managerial literature. Although most studies attribute the dominant position of platform orchestrators primarily to their economic power, it represents only one source of a broader multidimensional power. This study unveils a critical literature gap: the lack of systemic frameworks enlightening the multiple sources of the platform orchestrators' power. The research addresses this gap, adopting the systems thinking perspective that enables to enrich literature in two ways: first, to move beyond a monolithic definition of the platform orchestrator's power by identifying three different sources from which it emerges (economic, technological and regulatory); and second, to integrate the static view of platform orchestrators' power by enlightening how each source affects the other according to recursive interdependent feedback loops. The originality of this work is double: 1) it provides an insightful taxonomy of the three main sources of the platform orchestrator's power; 2) it develops a 3 × 3 matrix shedding light on the interdependences and feedback loops among the three sources of power.",10.1016/j.indmarman.2025.10.001,"Simone, Cristina; Laudando, Antonio; Scardini, Silvia"

Factors influencing digital platform firms internationalization: A review and research agenda,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.543689993447509,"Over the years, digital platforms have been a focus for international business scholars, especially those who see them as bringing nuances not seen in other firm types. Extensive reviews focusing on the internationalization of digital platforms are very few. There is no comprehensive review focusing on the factors influencing the internationalization of digital platforms. This paper critically reviews studies on the internationalization of digital platforms to identify factors affecting their internationalization. It also aims to identify research gaps and prepare future research agendas. A systematic literature review method guided by the TCCM approach was used for this review. The findings indicate that the category (proactive or reactive) of digital platforms, the ecosystem they belong to, and the region of operation are a starting point to determine the factors that influence internationalization. Secondly, the business model and, subsequently, the type of digital platform firm are crucial in understanding the internationalization dynamics of the firms. Thirdly, there are several under-explored research areas that provide potential for theory development and extension.",10.1016/j.jdec.2025.04.003,"Ochieng, Irene Achieng"
The role of the private sector and citizens in urban climate change adaptation: Evidence from a global assessment of large cities,2018,-1,Outliers,0.12295118784798562,"Expectations of cooperation between local authorities, the private sector, and citizens in climate change adaptation in cities are high because involvement of many actors is seen as critical to success. Scholars and policymakers argue that the private sector could be more efficient than the public authorities in implementing adaptation measures and argue for the need to engage citizens to ensure legitimacy of adaptation and inclusion of locally relevant knowledge. To what extent do cities address the private sector and citizens in their adaptation initiatives? What modes of governance do they use to do this? What kinds of cities are the most likely to address the private sector and citizens? Going beyond the existing case study approaches, this paper answers these questions using a large N data set covering 402 cities around the world. We find that a majority of adaptation initiatives focus exclusively on the public sector and do not address the private sector or citizens. In the cases where they do, the private sector is more often governed through partnerships and participation, whereas citizen participation is relatively rare. Initiatives involving citizens rely more often on a provision of information that encourages citizens to adapt. We find that the more advanced a city is in its adaptation process, the more likely it is to address the private sector than citizens in its initiatives to adapt to climate change. Whereas with partnerships and participation the private sector can influence urban adaptation arrangements at a broader scale, the provision of information allows citizens only to implement individual adaptation measures according to their capacities.",10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.09.012,"Klein, Johannes; Araos, Malcolm; Karimo, Aasa; Heikkinen, Milja; Ylä-Anttila, Tuomas; Juhola, Sirkku"

A readiness assessment framework for Blockchain adoption: A healthcare case study,2021,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Blockchain technology has been gaining traction across different sectors. It has the potential to immensely benefit the healthcare sector, given the sector's inherent complexities, problems, and inefficiencies. However, to date, no comprehensive, evidence-based effort has been made to understand the readiness of this sector for blockchain adoption. We proposed a readiness assessment framework that encompasses the complex interplay of different underlying factors, social structures, and institutional mechanisms and that covers all key stakeholders. Based on a systematic literature review, the framework is applied to the UAE's healthcare sector and its applicability and usefulness is established. The findings show the multifaceted significance of government readiness in driving blockchain initiatives. Large firms are found to be more willing to leverage the opportunities afforded by blockchain. Lack of clarity on blockchain regulations and laws, and issues pertaining to privacy and trust are found to affect the readiness of all stakeholders.

To what extent does virtual learning promote the implementation of responsible management education? A study of management educators,2023,-1,Outliers,0.0940236085637515,"This paper aims to explore the extent to which virtual learning fosters the implementation of responsible management education (RME) in public business schools in Egypt. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 management educators working at three public business schools in Egypt. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the collected data resulting in four major themes. The findings reveal that management educators perceive difficulty in implementing responsible management education in the context of virtual learning due to the following four factors: employing a student-centred learning approach, inability to use collaborative teaching pedagogies in virtual learning, lack of academic freedom, and poor info-structure characterising the Egyptian context. The present study is the pioneering works to empirically investigate the relationship between the shift towards virtual learning and the implementation of responsible management education, particularly in non-Western contexts.",10.1016/j.ijme.2023.100772,"Mousa, Mohamed; Arslan, Ahmad"

Way off the mark? Open innovation failures: Decoding what really matters to chart the future course of action,2022,-1,Outliers,0.1780745779934797,"With the increasing need for firms to implement innovation in their pursuit of competitive advantage, open innovation has attracted the growing attention of academics and practitioners. However, the current literature has been lopsided, focussing predominantly on the myriad benefits of open innovation. We argue that eulogising only the positive aspects of open innovation is insufficient to help firms and motivate future research. Therefore, we recommend increased attention to the dark side of open innovation, which includes failures that can occur at various stages of the open innovation process. A review of the existing literature reveals that although researchers have, time and again, attempted to document failure in open innovation, this literature is comparatively sparse and fragmented. The extant literature also exhibits an apparent lack of effort to encourage future research, as evidenced by the absence of a comprehensive literature review. We aim to address this research gap by reviewing 76 studies identified by applying a stringent search protocol consistent with the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. The contributions of this SLR include (a) development of a research profile of the relevant literature, (b) identification of five thematic areas, (c) elucidation of research gaps and suggestion of potential research questions as an agenda for future research on failures in open innovation, (d) formulation of a conceptual framework comprising the antecedents and outcomes of open innovation failure and (e) presentation of the various theoretical and managerial implications for scholars and practitioners.",10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.12.062,"Chaudhary, Sanjay; Kaur, Puneet; Talwar, Shalini; Islam, Nazrul; Dhir, Amandeep"
Data visibility of cyclists: social justice implications of Strava Metro data in transport planning,2025,-1,Outliers,0.4906819938878801,"This article investigates how the ‘datafication’ of cycling risks exacerbating existing mobility injustices associated with the privileging of data visibility over diversity. It focuses on the social justice implications of UK and US transport professionals’ perceptions of Strava Metro data, specifically around sample representativeness and bias. Our findings show how experts simultaneously recognise Strava Metro data as: (a) statistically valid and representative of observable cycling activities, including correlation with complementary cycle counter data. And as (b) demographically biased and unrepresentative of society, as Strava Metro data samples disproportionally capture journeys made by younger male cyclists. All expert interviewees emphasised the importance of considering a variety of data sources to support transport planning decisions, and emphasised Strava Metro data sample biases and limitations. However, our analysis of transport professional’s perceptions reveals how cycling app data, such as Strava Metro, has implications for social justice. These implications include distorting understandings of cycling at the detriment of diversifying cycling participation. Left unchecked, a privileging of hyper-visibility of select cyclists may slow efforts for socially sustainable and diverse cycling.

Addressing the risks of generative AI for the judiciary: The accountability framework(s) under the EU AI Act,2024,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.6084137871193575,"The rapid advancements in natural language processing, particularly the development of generative large language models (LLMs), have renewed interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for judicial decision-making. While these technological breakthroughs present new possibilities for legal automation, they also raise concerns about over-reliance and automation bias. Drawing insights from the COMPAS case, this paper examines the implications of deploying generative LLMs in the judicial domain. It identifies the persistent factors that contributed to an accountability gap when AI systems were previously used for judicial decision-making. To address these risks, the paper analyses the relevant provisions of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, outlining a comprehensive accountability framework based on the regulation's risk-based approach. The paper concludes that the successful integration of generative LLMs in judicial decision-making requires a holistic approach addressing cognitive biases. By emphasising shared responsibility and the imperative of AI literacy across the AI value chain, the regulatory framework can help mitigate the risks of automation bias and preserve the rule of law.",10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106067,"Carnat, Irina"

As existing literature mostly studied innovative city-regions of the Global North, there is an urgent need to examine the emerging latecomers, particularly those from the transitional economies. In this paper, Cluj-Napoca, Romania has been used a case to study the rising innovative city-regions in the transitional economies, their role in the global innovation networks, and the development of domestic innovation capability. The paper's specific objectives are to evaluate the current status of its regional innovation cluster in the global network, its structural strength and weakness, and the effectiveness of institutional management. A multi-case analysis approach has been used to analyze domestic companies and multinational corporations that are key actors in local innovation system. In addition to the secondary data, 23 interviews were conducted with local business, university researchers, and government officials. The main findings are: first, while Romania as an economy is still categorized as a factor-driven economy, sectors of some city-regions in the country, such as the ICT sector, has started to move towards the innovation-driven economy closely articulated in the global innovation network, especially in Europe's innovation network of software development. Second, while the region can be characterized as to have the relatively strong global pipelines, i.e., linkages with outside players, it has weak local buzz, i.e., local networks. Third, multinational corporations that have generally been attracted to the region due to the overseas-returnee community who are interested in linking Cluj-Napoca to the global innovation network. Local companies have equally benefited from the returning IT talents. One particular challenge is that although start-ups were emerging in Cluj-Napoca, the city-region was not effective at retaining these start-ups by providing opportunities for their further growth. Fourth, like any other city-region, Cluj-Napoca has been under the institutional influence at multiple levels, from the European Union (EU), the national government, the regional government, the county government, to the municipal government. However, close university-industry connection remains a challenge. It is recommended that the city-region should consider a variety of approaches to enhance the local buzz, specifically the social networks and innovation milieu of the city-region.

"Rural broadband: Gaps, maps and challenges",2021,-1,Outliers,0.11102119221203754,"This paper examines challenges to evidence-based decision-making in the design and implementation of rural broadband investment programs. Our focus is on Canada, and the apparent need for further intra-rural broadband research and better data and mapping for informing public investment decisions, but similar challenges are evident in the international literature. Based on proprietary telecommunication provider datasets, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunication Commission (CRTC) estimates that broadband services with advertised speeds that meet its basic universal service targets (50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload) are available to 87.4 percent of households in Canada. In rural areas however, services that meet CRTC’s speed targets are available to 45.6 percent of households. Moreover, effective speeds and service quality levels that suppliers deliver and users experience tend to fall well below the government’s aspirational targets. In response to demand for better broadband, a variety of initiatives are directing public investment to the deployment of regional and rural broadband networks, which are typically owned and operated by private companies. There remains a serious lack of relevant data and its effective use in creating rural broadband strategies and managing public investment projects. Evidence from the literature suggest that this affects the degree and quality of geo-spatial and econometric analysis that results in a limited empirical basis to allocate scarce public investments, aggregate demand of consumers/communities, and assess the outcomes of rural broadband initiatives ex post. This paper provides a historical overview of rural broadband development in Canada and questions if the body of knowledge to inform public investment initiatives has grown sufficiently to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability. With a regional case from southwestern Ontario, Canada, we discuss the findings of the literature review, characterize the broadband data challenge, and discuss the importance of proprietary provider data cross-referenced with Internet user experience data.",10.1016/j.tele.2021.101565,"Hambly, Helen; Rajabiun, Reza"

This paper presents the results of the second part of a longitudinal research project aimed at framing digital transformation within municipalities to improve urban infrastructure lifecycles. More specifically, the paper presents the results of work undertaken to operationalize, extend and further validate the digital transformation framework that has been developed in part 1 and which is presented elsewhere. The theoretical framework acts as a guide and analysis tool for the digital transformation of municipalities and aims to help them reduce and/or eliminate the barriers and challenges in this digital transformation. To do so, the results from a survey conducted within 44 municipalities and interviews conducted with 13 municipalities of different sizes are presented and discussed through the theoretical framework. The results show that data and information management remain the key issues, especially in a siloed organizational context such as those found within municipalities. Moreover, a significant amount of organizations remain unaware of how to approach digital transformation which in turn leads to disinterest or disengagement in digital transformation, which results in localized or fragmented initiatives. This in turn can cause delays in implementing transformational initiatives and contributes to maintaining a low level of digital maturity. The study also highlights the critical lack of human resources, expertise and appropriate training to support digital transformation.",10.1016/j.sftr.2023.100119,"Lafioune, Nawel; Desmarest, Anaïs; Poirier, Érik Andrew; St-Jacques, Michèle"

"Planning for uncertain transportation futures: Metropolitan planning organizations, emerging technologies, and adaptive transport planning",2024,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.745351787451021,"In the U.S., Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) play a pivotal role in regional transportation planning. Emerging transportation technologies present new challenges for transportation planning practice, which is experiencing growing uncertainty not only from these new technologies and other uncertainties, and MPOs must increasingly plan for the needs of new technologies and innovation. This study investigates how MPOs are currently planning for emerging technologies by analyzing regional transportation plans (RTPs) of the 50 largest MPOs and interviewing planning staff from 17 MPOs. We examine the extent to which anticipatory governance and responsible innovation, which come from science and technology studies (STS), are integrated into MPO planning efforts, shedding light on trends in transportation planning theory and practice. Findings reveal limited integration of anticipatory governance and responsible innovation into their planning processes. Some include aspects of foresight and engagement, but reflexivity, flexibility, and responsiveness are much less developed. Key actions being taken include more comprehensive thinking about region-specific impacts of technologies, developing policies, piloting technologies, building partnerships, and creating new tools and planning models. The extent to which these practices are creating adaptive capacities within MPOs is still limited. To address this, we propose an adaptive transportation planning model that combines anticipatory governance and responsible innovation with long-range transport planning. This integration is crucial for aiding MPOs and other planning agencies in developing robust governance systems, methodologies, and public policies to effectively manage technology within urban environments and navigate the increasingly complex challenges posed by emerging technologies and other uncertainties.",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101055,"McAslan, Devon; Kenney, Lisa; Najar Arevalo, Farah; King, David A.; Miller, Thaddeus R."

Investigating the barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology in sustainable construction projects,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.5545683678810513,"Blockchain technology (BT) can execute transactions verifiable and permanently, which can help foster the idea of embracing sustainability pillars within industries. Therefore, BT holds considerable promise for the industrial and service sectors; however, its implementation during the procurement stage in a sustainable construction project (SCP) is a bottleneck because of inherent and unknown barriers. Though some attempts on the identification of these barriers have been carried out, the literature lacks a thorough investigation into the relationships and inner dependencies among the related barriers within the realm of SCP. Thus, a novel combination of fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (fuzzy DEMATEL) and social network analysis (FDSNA) is proposed in this paper to fill this gap; FDSNA uncovers causal relationships among leading barriers that impede the adoption of BT within an SCP, and it determines the most critical barriers by modeling their complex interrelationships in related intricate environments. The obtained results suggest “inadequacies in implementing block chain-based policies” and “unawareness and resistance to BT among customers” as the most significant barriers, and “technology immaturity,” “market uncertainty and competition,” and “technology accessibility” are identified as the most critical. These results present managers and governmental bodies with an inclusive picture regarding the major obstructions to the successful implementation of BT, and it is expected to open avenues to accrue benefits from such leading-edge technologies at a greater pace.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.136840,"Kumar Singh, Atul; Kumar, V.R.

Cost factors affecting the utilisation of secondary materials in the construction sector: A systematic literature review,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"The building and construction sector accounts for a substantial portion of the consumption of natural resources and the generation of waste. The use of secondary materials in this sector offers a promising avenue to reduce reliance on primary materials and curb waste generation. However, the utilisation of these materials is heavily influenced by cost considerations and a comprehensive understanding of the associated costs is lacking. Therefore, this study systematically reviewed key literature to identify cost categories and factors that influence the cost of utilising secondary materials in construction projects. The PRISMA method was employed for asystematic review of the literature from 2013 to 2023. Furthermore, the study explored strategies for enhancing cost performance. The results delineated 13 distinct cost categories within five phases of materials' extended service life (i.e. end-of-life, secondary production, design and planning, installation in existing/new site and operation) and 53 factors influencing the cost performance of secondary materials. Additionally, 22 diverse strategies were identified to enhance this performance.

Assessing the role of triple helix system intermediaries in nurturing an industrial biotechnology innovation network,2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.39475056065546643,"The rate of transition to a circular economy would largely be influenced by how successfully sustainable niche innovation can be developed and adopted. This paper measures and evaluates the effectiveness of employing a triple helix-based system intermediary as a policy tool for nurturing a niche innovation network in line with circular economy transition. This was achieved through a complete social network analysis of a national industrial biotechnology innovation network, in which the organization functioning as network manager was innovatively structured as a triple helix-based system intermediary. Through unique access to the entire national industrial biotechnology niche network, a large set of primary data was collected on 13 types of relational ties related to innovation between all 64 public sector, industry and academic niche network member organizations. The impact of the triple helix-based system intermediary on the level of cohesion, presence of cohesive subgroups and centralisation of the niche network was empirically measured. As such, the effectiveness of the intermediary in undertaking key nurturing activities of building the network, facilitating shared learning and raising expectations were evaluated. This allowed for the most comprehensive empirical study to date on a niche innovation network and the role of system intermediaries in circular economy transition. The results of the analysis demonstrate the profound nurturing effect that the introduction of a triple helix-based system intermediary has had on the network. In particular, the results appear to confirm the effectiveness of the intermediary with regards to increasing knowledge and resource flows amongst triple helix institutions as well as between regime and niche actors.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.287,"Barrie, Jack; Zawdie, Girma; João, Elsa"
The wheel of artificial intelligence governance,2025,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Amidst growing concerns over the risks of unhinged Artificial Intelligence (AI) innovation, initiatives for AI governance are gaining centre stage across diverse sectors and national contexts. This review addresses the need for effective governance by synthesising the fragmented landscape of AI governance approaches. Using bibliometric analysis and an in-depth literature review, it maps and classifies governance approaches to develop a hybrid, iterative and integrated AI governance model. The literature analysis reveals four primary categories that govern AI: formal, informal, risk management, and eclectic. The findings are used to embed these approaches directly into the different phases of the AI lifecycle, adapted from CRISP-DM and CDAC AI lifecycles. Furthermore, grounded in Ostrom’s polycentric governance theory, the study proposes ‘The Wheel of AI Governance’ (WAG) model to align governance actions with distinct phases of the AI lifecycle. It offers proper checkpoints to AI developers, project managers, policymakers and organisations to design, direct the development, assess the deployment, regulate the societal integration and advocate changes through constant monitoring of the AI applications. The paper concludes with policy recommendations that focus not just on technical soundness but also on ethical alignment, legal compliance, participatory co-creation, and the good of the community.

The geopolitics of next generation mobile communication standardization: The case of open RAN,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.34480548241738973,"The U.S. confrontation with China in technology has been escalating. One of the triggers is China's rise in 5G standardization and its lead in the telecommunications equipment market, which causes security concerns. In response, the U.S. promotes Open RAN as an alternative to the Chinese providers' proprietary solutions. It is claimed to enable the establishment and operation of open and safer networks for 5G and beyond. This paper examines why and how the U.S. promotes Open RAN and what the responses are from other countries. We find that the U.S. government's strong support for the development and dissemination of Open RAN signals its techno-nationalistic turn in international standardization. The origin of Open RAN is geopolitical in the sense that it represents a reaction to China's lead in 5G standardization. The geopolitical perspective is strengthened as we find the formation of alliances in support of Open RAN. A refreshed approach of the U.S. to standardization has introduced a new dynamic to cooperation and competition for setting the global rules on next-generation mobile communication technologies as well as emerging technologies.

Therefore, this paper aims to review and identify the relevant factors that influence the acceptance of CC implementation in the organization. This study reviewed 55 articles related to CC implementation, and a total of 21 factors have been obtained through the several processes. These factors were arranged according to the frequency based on the thematic analysis method. As a result, 21 factors were obtained and ranked; Compatibility, Top Management Support, Relative Advantage, Security, Complexity, External Pressure, IT Knowledge, Cost, Trust, Trialability, Regulations & Government Support, Innovativeness, External expertise, Sharing & Collaboration, User experiences, Awareness, Firm Size, Social Influence, Task, Vendor Support, and Business Continuity. This study managed to unveil a new context in cloud computing studies as it provides more insights on the factors that may have been untouched.",10.1016/j.procs.2019.11.216,"Amron, Mohd Talmizie; Ibrahim, Roslina; Abu Bakar, Nur Azaliah; Chuprat, Suriayati"
"Role and challenge of technology toward a smart sustainable city: Topic modeling, classification, and time series analysis using information and communication technology patent data",2022,-1,Outliers,0.23763283480411462,"This research defines and classifies essential technology groups that comprise a smart sustainable city (SSC) and explores patterns of technological growth by analyzing patents. First, topic modeling and network analysis are conducted using patent text data and international patent classification code, respectively. Patents are classified and defined based on the technology theme and the type of technology provider. Second, hardware-oriented and service application-oriented technologies are classified and predicted using machine learning. Third, the similarities in growth patterns of different technology groups are explored using dynamic time warping (DTW). Moreover, lagging or preceding relationships are examined using multivariate time series analysis. Network infrastructure and Internet-of-things (IoT) application technologies have short-term lagging and preceding relationships along with long-term equilibrium relationships. In terms of player groups, long-term relationships between device vendors, chipset makers, network operator and IoT service provider, and network equipment vendors are confirmed. Technologies for realizing a sustainable city must be prioritized, and the strategic direction of technology must be established to realize truly smart sustainable cities. The supplier of technologies along with possible collaboration opportunities must also be selected. This study proposes the role and direction of technology for SSC and presents a comprehensive methodology for analyzing technology using patents.",10.1016/j.scs.2022.103888,"Kim, Dongwook; Kim, Sungbum"
Factors influencing readiness for artificial intelligence: a systematic literature review,2025,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.4484146681833663,"Public-and private-sector organizations have adopted artificial intelligence (AI) to meet the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The successful implementation of AI is a challenging task, and previous research has advocated the need to explore key readiness before AI implementation. The objective of this study is to identify the AI readiness factors explored by different authors in past research. To achieve this, we conducted a rigorous literature review. The approach used in the systematic literature review is also discussed. A rigorous review of 52 studies from various journals and databases (Science Direct, Springer Link, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Emerald, and Google Scholar) identified 23 AI readiness factors. The key factors identified were mainly related to organizational information technology infrastructure, top management support, resource availability, collaborative culture, organizational size, organizational capability, compatibility, data quality, and financial budget, whereas the other 15 were potential factors in AI readiness. All of these factors should be considered before the implementation of AI in any organization. The findings also reflect a high failure rate, including AI readiness factors, which are intended to facilitate AI adoption in organizations and reduce the frequency of failures. These factors will aid management in developing an effective strategy for AI implementation in organizations.",10.1016/j.dsm.2024.09.005,"Ali, Wajid; Khan, Abdul Zahid"
Tracing the boundaries between sustainable cities and cities for sustainable development. An LDA analysis of management studies,2022,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have focused their attention on the absence of a comprehensive definition of ‘sustainable cities’. The discussion has also interested the United Nations, which has contributed by providing a point of reference for local governments in the Agenda 2030. To shed light on the debate, the present study has adopted a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) analysis of the literature produced within the last five years. Furthermore, this study has adopted a bibliometric analysis to provide further insights into the published literature. Finally, the institutional work theory has been used to read the results of the analysis concerning the three main institutional works identified by scholars: political, technical, and cultural work. The study has revealed eight different trends concerning sustainable cities research, involving topics such as urban development, public management, environmental issues, and cultural impact on citizens. Additionally, topic analysis has resulted in a strong connection with the SDG 11. Conclusions of the analysis include the realisation that the sustainable city is supported by the political work of local governments and by the contributions of either the cultural or the technical work of city institutional actors.",10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121447,"Ligorio, Lorenzo; Venturelli, Andrea; Caputo, Fabio"
The Success of Technology Transfer in the Industry 4.0 Era: A Systematic Literature Review,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.32483438252252556,"ABSTRACT Modern innovative models have the possibility of transferring research and development (R&D) output through technology transfer from scientific and research institutions or other enterprises. The complex process of technology transfer is significantly dependent on cooperation among academia, industry, and governments (I4.0) in response to the technological developments driven together through Industry 4.0. As a result, numerous technology transfer factors must be addressed for I4.0 to become a reality. However, the abundance of literature on I4.0 and associated technologies, the key ingredients, and insights for effectively executing I4.0 technology transfer are fairly limited. This study focuses on the success factors of technology transfer for I4.0. The framework is based on systematic literature to outline significant results and factors. Furthermore, this study summarizes, analysis, and criticizes the actual models and their influential variables for I4.0 technology transfer. One of the findings of this study is the significance of cooperation between technology recipients, agents, and inventors for I4.0 technology transfer. Another impressive finding is the significance of the ecosystem component in technology transfer. Combining I4.0 technologies and open innovation is a game-changer, enabling businesses to significantly save time and cost. This article will assist decision-makers in developing policies and strategies to improve the I4.0 technology transfer process. Furthermore, this involves identifying the kind of government assistance that will help accelerate the transition to I4.0 via technology transfer.",10.3390/joitmc8040202,"Alkhazaleh, Razan; Mykoniatis, Konstantinos; Alahmer, Ali"

Procedural fairness in automated asylum procedures: Fundamental rights for fundamental challenges,2024,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"In response to the increasing digitalization of asylum procedures, this paper examines the legal challenges surrounding the use of automated tools in refugee status determination (RSD). Focusing on the European Union (EU) context, where interoperable databases and advanced technologies are employed to streamline asylum processes, the paper asks how EU fundamental rights can address the challenges that automation raises. Through a comprehensive analysis of EU law and several real-life cases, the paper focuses on the relationship between procedural fairness and the use of automated tools to provide evidence in RSD. The paper illustrates what standards apply to automated systems based on a legal doctrinal analysis of EU primary and secondary law and emerging case law from national courts and the CJEU. The article contends that the rights to privacy and data protection enhance procedural fairness in asylum procedures and shows how they can be leveraged for increased protection of asylum seekers and refugees. Moreover, the paper also claims that asylum authorities carry a new pivotal responsibility as the medium between the technologies, asylum seekers and their rights.",10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106065,"Palmiotto, Francesca"
Trends and characteristics of China's medical informatization policy from 1996 to 2020: a bibliometric analysis,2021,-1,Outliers,0.08538862030594924,"Purpose Qualitative methods are not suitable to process high volumes of policy texts for exploring policy evolution. Therefore, it is hard to use qualitative methods to systematically analyze the characteristics of complex policy networks. So the authors propose a bibliometric research study for exploring policy evolution from time–agency–theme perspectives to excavate the rules and existing problems of China's medical informatization policy and to provide suggestions for formulating and improving the future medical informatization policies. Design/methodology/approach Initially, 615 valid samples are obtained by retrieving related China's medical informatization policy documents, and the joint policy-making agency network and the co-occurrence network models of medical informatization policies are defined, and then the authors research China's medical informatization policies from single-dimension and multi-dimension view. Findings The analysis results reveal that China's medical informatization policy process can be divided into four stages; the policy-making agencies are divided into four subgroups by community detection analysis according to the fast unfolding algorithm; the core policy theme keywords are identified based on the eigenvector centrality of the nodes in those networks; the focuses of theme terms are varied in different stages and the correlations between agencies and themes are gradually decentralized. Practical implications These findings provide experience and evidence on leveraging informatics in the medical and healthcare field of China. Also, they can help scholars and practitioners better understand the current status and future directions of medical and healthcare informatics development in China and provide a reference to formulate and improve China's future medical informatization policies.

Making urban design a public participatory goal: toward evidence-based urbanism,2017,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"The paper builds on the evidence of an increasing consensus towards citizens' engagement practices in shaping both the form and functioning of the city, and on the apparent distance between the setting up of governance structures adequate for participatory processes to be performed, and the daily urban planning and design. Against this context, the research investigates whether public participation processes are adequately and appropriately addressed in urban planning and design practices. A bibliometric analysis on participatory processes' connection with urban studies (including urban governance, planning, design and development) is described, together with an in-depth evaluation of some works, which makes it possible to appreciate the complexity of the topic. The bibliometric analysis  shows a significant divide between the traditional fields of social sciences, built environment disciplines and information technologies; and no common understanding or framework to translate aspirations for greater citizen participation into improved planning, design and construction of city infrastructures. Discussion and conclusions provide, thus, some guidelines for an ambitious research agenda to address these shortcomings based on a systems approach, able to integrate the processes and results from direct participatory processes into decision making for urban planning and design.",10.1680/jurdp.16.00038,"Dyer, Mark; Corsini, Filippo; Certomà, Chiara"
"Not everything is as it seems: Digital technology affordance, pandemic control, and the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements",2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7030644967819322,"An overly favorable narrative has developed around the role played by digital technologies in containing Covid-19, which oversimplifies the complexity of technology adoption. This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems; implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices; ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems; bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing; and electronic mass communications media. Reporting on our findings, we add nuances to the academic debate on sociomateriality, technology affordance, and the governance of technology in public health crises. In addition, we provide public authorities with practical recommendations on how to strengthen their approach to digital technology deployment for pandemic control.",10.1016/j.giq.2021.101599,"Mora, Luca; Kummitha, Rama Krishna Reddy; Esposito, Giovanni"
IT-enhanced popular reports: Analyzing citizen preferences,2017,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.1743681098767837,"Popular reporting is a means of bringing local government financial information closer to citizens. Nevertheless, the interest of citizens on popular reports appears to be less than optimal. In this paper, we assess whether the use of modern technology and the Internet could boost citizens' interest in popular reporting, which in turn would potentially motivate them to have a more active participation in public issues. More specifically, we examine whether the presentation format of a given popular report has different value to users. Our analysis is based on earlier works performed in relation to reporting formats in the private sector. For this purpose, we develop a concise popular report for a hypothetical municipality under three different formats (traditional PDF, flipping book and website) and we set up a questionnaire to evaluate an array of aspects namely completeness of information, clarity of information, visual appearance, navigation, usability, overall satisfaction and municipality image in each one of them. The questionnaire was answered by a sample of 165 respondents. The findings show that the website format outperforms the traditional ways of a popular report presentation in the majority of aspects examined. Therefore, this study provides collaborative evidence that the use of ICT as a means of making popular reports more attractive and useful to citizens would yield positive results with possible spillover effects to democratic participation.",10.1016/j.giq.2017.04.003,"Cohen, Sandra; Mamakou, Xenia J.; Karatzimas, Sotirios"

Social network analysis (SNA) and machine learning (ML) techniques make it feasible to assess the service performance in China's SCS by using indicators such as group types and structure features. In this study, SNA and a clustering algorithm were employed to categorize service group types of sci-tech commissioners. By comparing the accuracy of different classification algorithms in predicting the clustering results, LightGBM algorithm was finally select to determine the clustering features of sci-tech commissioners and establish an interpretable ML model. Then, the SHAP was used to algorithm to analyze influences affecting service performance. Results show that the service forms of sci-tech commissioners are group-oriented, and that group types include small groups of young commissioners with close cooperation, larger groups of young and middle-aged commissioners, small groups of middle-aged and old commissioners with close cooperation, and isolated points of highly-influential commissioners. Furthermore, while group size is not the determinant of a commissioner's average performance, group structure and coordination ability were found to be more critical.

What you see depends on where you look: performance measurement of Australian accounting academics,2020,-1,Outliers,0.09561261694222697,"Purpose This paper explores the impact of contemporary calculative practices, termed “accountingisation”, on Australian accounting academics' values. Also, it seeks to understand the rationale underlying the development of various university performance measurement systems (PMSs), and their implementation and evaluation. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach uses accounting academics' responses to an online survey and also semi-structured interviews with senior research-related leaders in a group of Australian universities. This is supplemented by document analysis. A narrative story-telling approach explores and presents the combined data observations, over the period 2010–2018, of two characters: a “typical” accounting academic and a “typical” vice-chancellor. Findings The study contributes to the literature on PMSs in understanding “accountingisation”, the rationale behind the development, implementation and evaluation of performance metrics by senior management and its impact on accounting academics. It juxtaposes and unpacks the complexities and nuances of PMSs and provides empirical evidence by highlighting the perceptions of both the Australian accounting academics and senior university management. The findings demonstrate a level of discontent among accounting academics in reconciling the expectations of increased “accountingisation” within university PMSs. These are juxtaposed against the views of senior university leaders who are influential in determining PMSs.

Objective Using a standardized patient (SP) approach, this study aimed to compare the quality of DTC telemedicine provided by China’s public and private sectors. Methods We recruited 10 SPs presenting fixed cases (urticaria and childhood diarrhea), with 594 interactions between them and physicians. The SPs evaluated various aspects of the quality of care, effectiveness, safety, patient-centeredness (PCC), efficiency, and timeliness using the Institute of Medicine (IOM) quality framework. Ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression models with fixed effects were used for continuous variables, while logistic regression models with fixed effects were used for categorical variables. Results Significant quality differences were observed between public and private DTC telemedicine. Physicians from private platforms were significantly more likely to adhere to clinical checklists (adjusted β 15.22, P<.001); provide an accurate diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.85, P<.001), an appropriate prescription (adjusted OR 3.87, P<.001), and lifestyle modification advice (adjusted OR 6.82, P<.001); ensure more PCC (adjusted β 3.34, P<.001); and spend more time with SPs (adjusted β 839.70, P<.001), with more responses (adjusted β 1.33, P=.001) and more words (adjusted β 50.93, P=.009). However, SPs on private platforms waited longer for the first response (adjusted β 505.87, P=.001) and each response (adjusted β 168.33, P=.04) and paid more for the average visit (adjusted β 40.03, P<.001). Conclusions There is significant quality inequality in different DTC telemedicine platforms. Private physicians might provide a higher quality of service regarding effectiveness and safety, PCC, and response times and words. However, private platforms have longer wait times for their first response, as well as higher costs. Refining online reviews, establishing standardized norms and pricing, enhancing the performance evaluation mechanism for public DTC telemedicine, and imposing stricter limitations on the first response time for private physicians should be considered practical approaches to optimizing the management of DTC telemedicine.",10.2196/55400,"Song, Faying; Gong, Xue; Yang, Yuting; Guo, Rui"
Exploring Literature on Data Governance in the Health Care of Older Persons: Scoping Review,2025,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.15521425159709085,"Background Health data are growing rapidly, and the processing of such data is evolving. Research on data governance in older persons’ health care is unexplored, providing little guidance for practice and future studies. Objective This scoping review aimed to synthesize available information on data governance in the context of older persons’ health based on evidence from literature. Methods The study followed the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley and PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). Online databases, namely, PubMed, Cochrane, Ovid, ACM, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar were searched by 2 independent reviewers (AG and AMB) for studies on older persons’ health data governance published from January 2000 to April 2024. The independent reviewers performed the search, screening, data extraction, and review of full-text papers. A third reviewer (YP) made the final decision for unresolved discrepancies between the first 2 reviewers. The framework by the World Health Organization Pan American Health Organization, a high-level framework for planning and implementing data governance in public health, was used in the data extraction and analysis. Descriptive statistics were used, and a descriptive approach was used to summarize the results of the scoping review. Results A total of 9840 titles were identified and 57 papers were included. Of these, 35 (61.4%) focused on technology, 19 (33.3%) on processes, and 3 (5.3%) on people. Data controller, processor, researchers, data subject or patient (including family or relatives), and relevant organizations were involved in older persons’ data governance. Data governance frameworks were designed and implemented by reviewing the current evidence, involving the stakeholders throughout the process, implementing specific procedures (eg, collection and aggregating health data), and monitoring and evaluating them. Conclusions The review underscores the importance of the involvement of relevant stakeholders and the use of various innovative tools and approaches in governing data related to the health of older persons. Meanwhile, research specifically addressing data governance for older persons’ health conditions is limited. To enhance health outcomes for older persons, effective data governance is essential, alongside further research on relevant policies and practices.",10.2196/73625,"Garcia, Angely; Balingbing, Ayra Mae; Palad, Yves"
From theory to practice: Practical implications as a translational bridge between research relevance and impact,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.4042662061189368,"Academic research in marketing and in business and management has been criticized for its lack of relevance for practice, with calls for stronger interaction between academia and practice, to improve impact and benefit to the world. The practical or managerial implications included in journal articles are important in bridging this divide. Yet the role of these implications in ensuring academic research has wider economic and social impact is significantly under-researched. This article addresses this gap by developing a generalizable conceptual framework for examining the practical implications associated with academic research findings. A systematic literature review that focuses on digital marketing is used to assess the usefulness of this practical implications framework. Insights are provided into the dimensions that underpin how effectively these practical implications bridge the theory-practice divide and support economic and social impact. Multilevel archetypes of practical implications are developed to guide best practice in developing and reporting practical implications for researchers, journal reviewers, editors and publishers.",10.1016/j.indmarman.2024.12.017,"Setkute, Justina; Dibb, Sally"
On revealing shared conceptualization among open datasets,2021,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.1883287656977297,"Openness and transparency initiatives are not only milestones of science progress but have also influenced various fields of organization and industry. Under this influence, varieties of government institutions worldwide have published a large number of datasets through open data portals. Government data covers diverse subjects and the scale of available data is growing every year. Published data is expected to be both accessible and discoverable. For these purposes, portals take advantage of metadata accompanying datasets. However, a part of metadata is often missing which decreases users’ ability to obtain the desired information. As the scale of published datasets grows, this problem increases. An approach we describe in this paper is focused towards decreasing this problem by implementing knowledge structures and algorithms capable of proposing the best match for the category where an uncategorized dataset should belong to. By doing so, our aim is twofold: enrich datasets metadata by suggesting an appropriate category and increase its visibility and discoverability. Our approach relies on information regarding open datasets provided by users — dataset description contained within dataset tags. Since dataset tags express low consistency due to their origin, in this paper we will present a method of optimizing their usage through means of semantic similarity measures based on natural language processing mechanisms. Optimization is performed in terms of reducing the number of distinct tag values used for dataset description. Once optimized, dataset tags are used to reveal shared conceptualization originating from their usage by means of Formal Concept Analysis. We will demonstrate the advantage of our proposal by comparing concept lattices generated using Formal Concept Analysis before and after the optimization process and use generated structure as a knowledge base to categorize uncategorized open datasets. Finally, we will present a categorization mechanism based on the generated knowledge base that takes advantage of semantic similarity measures to propose a category suitable for an uncategorized dataset.",10.1016/j.websem.2020.100624,"Bogdanović, Miloš; Veljković, Nataša; Frtunić Gligorijević, Milena; Puflović, Darko; Stoimenov, Leonid"
Data Protection Impact Assessment under the EU General Data Protection Regulation: A feminist reflection,2024,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"Can the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under Article 35 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) address the power imbalances between those in control of information and the most vulnerable and marginalised persons to whom this information refers? Put another way, can DPIA be considered a feminist tool? Whilst data protection scholars and regulators consider DPIA a promising instrument for the protection of the fundamental rights threatened by personal data processing, particularly when performed by automated systems, a feminist critique thereof, essential to comprehensively evaluate whether such optimism is justified, is still missing. This contribution addresses this knowledge gap using a combination of doctrinal and non-doctrinal analysis, feminist legal methods and intersectionality. Building on the state of the art about DPIA, I revisit its advantages and drawbacks through feminist lenses, concluding that DPIA cannot be considered a feminist tool as such. Yet, it could still serve feminist goals and become an empowering instrument for data subjects. For that, my proposals are to incorporate feminist legal methods and intersectionality principles in the process and to conceptualise a “right to DPIA”.",10.1016/j.clsr.2024.105950,"Calvi, Alessandra"
The population health role of academic health centres: a multiple-case exploratory study in Australia and England,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.26276763457953706,"Background Academic health centres (AHCs) are organisations that aim to mobilise knowledge into practice by improving the responsiveness of health systems to emerging evidence. This study aims to explore the population health role of AHCs in Australia and England, where AHCs represent novel organisational forms. Methods A multiple-case study design using qualitative methods was used to explore population health goals and activities in four discrete AHCs in both countries during 2017 and 2018. Data from 85 interviews with AHC leaders, clinicians and researchers, direct observation, and documentation were analysed within and across the cases. Results Comparison across cases produced four cross-case themes: health care rather than population health; incremental rather than major health system change; different conceptions of “translation” and “innovation”; and unclear pathways to impact. The ability of the AHCs to define and enact a population health role was hindered during the study period by gaps in knowledge mobilisation strategies at a health system and policy level, the biomedical orientation of government designation schemes for AHCs in Australia and England, and competing expectations of the sovereign partner organisations in AHCs against a backdrop of limited operational resources. Discussion The study identifies several institutional elements that are likely to be needed for AHCs in Australia and England to deliver on both internal and external expectations of their population health role.",10.1016/j.healthpol.2022.08.008,"Edelman, Alexandra; Taylor, Judy; Ovseiko, Pavel V; Larkins, Sarah; Topp, Stephanie M"
Navigating the Energy Transition in India: Challenges and Opportunities Towards Sustainable Energy Goal,2025,-1,Outliers,0.22462221747724526,"India holds a pivotal position in the evolving global energy landscape, presenting immense opportunities alongside notable challenges. The nation’s energy transition aims to address the increasing energy demand while curbing carbon emissions to tackle climate change. According to the World Energy Outlook 2024, India’s energy demand was 1074 Mtoe in 2023 and is expected to rise to 1921 Mtoe by 2040. Key challenges in this shift include economic and social risks from job losses in the fossil fuel sector, heavy dependence on coal, inconsistent policies, and inadequate infrastructure for integrating renewable energy. Additionally, the transition faces technological hurdles, land acquisition issues, market barriers and water challenges. India with 18 % of the population and just 4% of the world’s water supply faces the challenges of being water stressed country. Water is very important for India’s energy sector especially in energy generation which the paper focusses upon. India possesses significant renewable energy potential, particularly in solar and wind power within its energy mix, bolstered by strong government policies, international agreements, and technological advancements. As of September 2024, India’s solar energy capacity reached 90.76 GW, while wind energy capacity stood at 47.36 GW, significantly advancing the country’s energy transition. India’s commitment to sustainability is demonstrated by initiatives like the National Action Plan on Climate Change and its target of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 as mentioned in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) set after the Paris Agreement. The paper focusses the problems that India is facing for its energy transition including but not limited to its dependency on fossil fuels, social barriers, economic constraints and technological challenges and the way it is addressing these challenges. The current status of India’s energy mix has been mentioned and the evolution of the energy policy has been analysed. India has some great policies on ground but the efforts should be made for the stronger implementation of these policies for the sustainable energy transition. Key findings show that while India has done well in deployment of renewable energy, societal barriers, economic limits, technological limits and the dependence on fossil fuels still plague India. India’s energy transition will play a pivotal role in shaping global energy policies. India’s experience shows that, for a low carbon future, strong policies, innovation and immediate action is the key, and that this experience can provide the lessons for global energy transitions to be low carbon, and yet fair and equitable.",10.1016/j.wen.2025.07.004,"Prajapati, Preeti; Guo, Ru; Cai, Angzu; Prasad, Rajendra"
Mapping the landscape and roadmap of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) in quantitative human geography: An extensive systematic review,2024,-1,Outliers,0.18364106271983033,"This paper brings a comprehensive systematic review of the application of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) in quantitative human geography studies, including the subdomains of cultural, economic, political, historical, urban, population, social, health, rural, regional, tourism, behavioural, environmental and transport geography. In this extensive review, we obtain 14,537 papers from the Web of Science in the relevant fields and select 1516 papers that we identify as human geography studies using GeoAI via human scanning conducted by several research groups around the world. We outline the GeoAI applications in human geography by systematically summarising the number of publications over the years, empirical studies across countries, the categories of data sources used in GeoAI applications, and their modelling tasks across different subdomains. We find out that existing human geography studies have limited capacity to monitor complex human behaviour and examine the non-linear relationship between human behaviour and its potential drivers—such limits can be overcome by GeoAI models with the capacity to handle complexity. We elaborate on the current progress and status of GeoAI applications within each subdomain of human geography, point out the issues and challenges, as well as propose the directions and research opportunities for using GeoAI in future human geography studies in the context of sustainable and open science, generative AI, and quantum revolution.",10.1016/j.jag.2024.103734,"Wang, Siqin; Huang, Xiao; Liu, Pengyuan; Zhang, Mengxi; Biljecki, Filip; Hu, Tao; Fu, Xiaokang; Liu, Lingbo; Liu, Xintao; Wang, Ruomei; Huang, Yuanyuan; Yan, Jingjing; Jiang, Jinghan; Chukwu, Michaelmary; Reza Naghedi, Seyed; Hemmati, Moein; Shao, Yaxiong; Jia, Nan; Xiao, Zhiyang; Tian, Tian; Hu, Yaxin; Yu, Lixiaona; Yap, Winston; Macatulad, Edgardo; Chen, Zhuo; Cui, Yunhe; Ito, Koichi; Ye, Mengbi; Fan, Zicheng; Lei, Binyu; Bao, Shuming"

However, the real industry implementation of the integrated approach has been challenging. Even separately, both Lean and Industry 4.0 have high failure rates. Understanding these implementations is essential to increase the application's success and build a bridge between academia and industry. This research uses a systematic literature review methodology to identify case studies that integrate the implementation of lean principles with Industry 4.0 technology. The benefits, barriers, and success factors of the integration were investigated, focusing on environmental, social, and operational perspectives. Forty-two case studies that included lean principles and Industry 4.0 technology in the manufacturing context were identified. The integration resulted in various operational benefits regarding lead-time, throughput, and quality. In terms of environmental impact, there is a potential to estimate the use of resources involved in the production and reduce CO2 emissions. Other benefits include improved employee welfare, better communication, employee empowerment. The main barrier is the investment cost followed by technological readiness.

The Europeanization of Public Administration teaching,2016,-1,Outliers,0.09753196259554939,"Despite several decades of the Europeanization of Higher Education there is no single European model for teaching Public Administration (PA). Neither is there a single model of public administration in practice, even if European countries have been witnessing an extension of the European policy and administrative space as well as pressures for public sector convergence. Yet, this article shows that PA teaching has Europeanized in two significant ways. First, while the Europeanization of curricular content was still in its infancy 25 years ago, PA programs now project European content in their curricula. Second, and more importantly, Europeanization of PA has emerged, not as a movement to creating identikit education in PA, but as a common understanding of the quality of a discipline that remains necessarily context bound by its national, local and international dimensions. Following accepted complementary perspectives on Europeanization, the article explains the development of sustainable European PA institutions and standards for PA teaching as the result of responses to EU incentives as well as of social learning within transnational networks of European PA scholars. The article analyzes the process and results of collaborative peer-learning activities in the European scholarly community, including the Erasmus-Socrates collaborative PA networks, the European Accreditation of Public Administration Programs and the definition of a European set of PA competences that are used in PA program development and quality control.

All sectors of the economy have been affected by this technological advancement. However, little is known of how 4IR technologies are used in Africa. This paper aimed to investigate how 4IR technologies can be harnessed to support sustainable development in Africa. The objectives of the study were to: examine the infometric patterns of research production on 4IR technologies for sustainable development in Africa; explore the perception of 4IR technologies and their potential for sustainable development in Africa; investigate the extent to which 4IR technologies have been harnessed to support sustainable development in Africa; determine the factors influencing the use of 4IR technologies for sustainable development in Africa; and identify the strategies which can be used to harness 4IR technologies for sustainable development in Africa. Design/methodology/approach The study applied a mixed methods research approach. Quantitative data was collected through bibliometrics analysis while qualitative data was collected by use of systematic literature review. Data was collected from Google Scholar using Harzing's “Publish or Perish” software and analysed using Microsoft Excel, Notepad, VOSviewer and Atlas.ti and presented using tables, graphs and figures. Findings The study retrieved 914 research publications on 4IR and sustainable development in Africa. It emerged that production of research on the subject has increased gradually over the years. The findings reveal that Africa is aware of the potential of 4IR for sustainable development. In fact, it emerged that 4IR technologies are being used to support education, health services, tourism, e-commerce, records integrity and project management. Some of the factors that inhibit the use of 4IR for sustainable development Africa include lack of relevant policies, low skill levels in 4IR technologies, inadequate infrastructure and lack of stakeholder involvement. This study recommends the development of policies in 4IR, capacity building and upgrading of infrastructures. The findings can be used by governments in Africa to harness 4IR technologies for sustainable development. Originality/value The research is original in scope and coverage.",10.1108/TECHS-01-2023-0004,"Kibe, Lucy; Kwanya, Tom; Nyagowa, Hesbon"
Digital Economy's influence on R&D Network configurations: Integrating resource dependence theory and institutional theory,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"This study addresses the transformative impacts of the digital economy, which forges connections throughout Research & Development (R&D) networks, prompting leaders of forward-thinking organizations to predict market shifts, guided by the frameworks of institutional theory and resource dependence theory. Institutional theory highlights the pressures, both coercive and normative, arising from the digital economy and regulatory environments, whereas resource dependence theory elucidates the strategic approaches organizations adopt to acquire vital resources and minimize network dependencies. This innovative research investigates how an organization's orientation towards the digital economy affects its role within R&D networks, leveraging insights from both theoretical standpoints. By pinpointing technology transformation and legal environment as key moderators, this study assesses their moderating effects. The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing 141,118 patents spanning from 1995 to 2018, concentrating on R&D efforts within China's strategic emerging sectors. The outcomes show that an organization's digital economy orientation, shaped by institutional norms and resource interdependencies, positively influences its network centrality but negatively impacts its structural hole position. Additionally, technology transformation and the legal environment, as institutional mechanisms, negatively modulate the relationship between digital economy orientation and network centrality, but positively influence the structural hole relationship. The study concludes with a bibliometric analysis to situate our findings within existing literature and discusses the theoretical and practical implications, rooted in institutional and resource dependence theories.",10.1016/j.technovation.2024.103098,"Xing, Zeyu; Yalçin, Haydar; Daim, Tugrul"
"COVID-19, migration and inclusive cities through e-governance: strategies to manage asylum seekers in Durban, South Africa",2021,-1,Outliers,0.10199093197023125,"Purpose This paper aims to examine the role of electronic governance (e-governance) in enabling asylum seekers’ access to public services in the city of Durban, South Africa. Because of COVID-19, the government scaled down its operations, limiting access to public services, including among migrants. Design/methodology/approach Because of COVID-19-related restrictions, a systematic review was conducted of the relevant academic literature as well as the information portals of relevant government departments, municipalities and research reports on migration and refugees in South Africa. A total of 320 peer-reviewed research articles were identified. These were filtered and 68 relevant articles were selected. Findings The study found that asylum seekers have limited access to public services via information communication technology-enabled mechanisms. Whilst the city government has embraced e-governance, it is still in its nascent stages. Research limitations/implications This study was limited to a desktop one because of COVID-19 restrictions and it focused exclusively on asylum seekers. Therefore, its findings can only be generalised to this category of people. Practical implications Future studies on this subject should gather data from all categories of migrants to gain in-depth perspectives. Social implications All spheres of governance in South Africa should recognise asylum seekers as a constituency that deserves access to public services. E-governance can facilitate easier access to these services, and policies need to be aligned with this reality. Originality/value This study examined the efficacy of e-governance in enabling access to government services by asylum seekers during COVID-19.

Research Roadmap for Designing a Virtual Competence Assistant for the European Labour Market,2022,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.28928831854679576,"This research proposal explores how citizen-centered learning and career advancement can benefit from artificial intelligence, occupational classification frameworks, and the concept of proactive services. In the current literature, there are a lot of machine learning methods used in various job and training recommendation systems to tackle scientific or real-life problems. However, only a few use the existing occupational classifications to classify job and training advertisements or enable cross-regional labor mobility. Additionally, the quality of public e-services regarding labour market services in each European country varies greatly. For example, even though Estonia is typically referred to as being at the forefront of public service digitization and automation, it has not implemented machine learning methods to match job offers or training with candidates. The matching process between vacancy and job seeker is currently carried out with outdated International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) codes, altered to the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund's needs. The ISCO code is assigned to each job vacancy by a company and job wish by a citizen manually. Such functionality is rigid and requires the users to define an accurate ISCO code. Even when the filled-in CV consists of detailed previous work experience and educational background, if the ISCO code is not accurate, the e-service will not help the citizen find a new job. Moreover, in today's public employment service portals, there is typically no option to insert specific skills that a citizen has to receive an increased number of accurate job or training recommendations. Consequently, despite many well-established frameworks dealing with competencies and occupations, citizen-centered public services supporting upskilling and finding a new job are inefficient. In this paper, we put forth a research roadmap for investigating how to enable a technical ecosystem using occupational classification frameworks so that citizens, both employed and unemployed, can receive proactive recommendations about upcoming training events and job vacancies. Such a system should be tailored to support citizen life events. For example, it could consider citizens’ previous work and educational background to help with retraining, upskilling, or changing one's career path. Therefore we have initiated a project in collaboration with the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund, the Estonian Qualifications Authority, other Estonian public organizations, and partner universities in Latvia and Finland. The research is planned as an action design research to design an artificial intelligence-enabled Virtual Competence Assistant (VCA) for the EU labour market.",10.1016/j.procs.2022.09.299,"Liutkevičius, Markko; Yahia, Sadok Ben"
Systematic review on blockchain research for sustainability accounting applying methodology coding and text mining,2023,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) are often considered major improvements in the capability of certain areas in sustainability accounting research.

Towards optimal decision making in mass casualty incidents management through ICT: A systematic review,2024,-1,Outliers,0.11580442130881563,"Objective To examine the prevalence and trend of experimental research on the effectiveness of ICT use in supporting the management of mass casualty incidents. Methods A systematic review was conducted in five electronic databases between February and March 2022 following the PRISMA guidelines. The analysis included studies published since 2012. Results A total of fifteen studies were included in the final analysis. Three themes were identified: 1) the response of medical teams to mass casualty incidents, 2) the simulation of mass casualty incidents, and 3) the digitisation of mass casualty incident workflows. Conclusion The available evidence is limited due to the relatively small number of studies on the use of information and communication technology and the response of emergency rescue teams to mass casualty incidents. Therefore, further research is needed on the impact of information and communication technology on the efficiency, work, and decision-making of incident commanders during mass casualty incidents. Furthermore, more dynamism is needed to accumulate knowledge and methodological expertise to explore experimental ideas in the European Union, where such research is lacking.",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2024.104281,"Režek, Primož; Žvanut, Boštjan"
Mapping the operations and supply chain management field: a journal governance perspective,2017,-1,Outliers,0.1438085654572923,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to address the following research question: how do the interlocking editorial advisory boards (EABs) of operations and supply chain management (OSCM) journals map out the field’s diverse academic communities and how demographically diverse is the field and its communities? Design/methodology/approach The study applies social network analysis (SNA) to web-based EAB data for 38 journals listed under operations management (OM) in the 2010 ABS Academic Journal Quality Guide. Findings The members of EABs of the 38 journals are divided into seven distinct communities which are mapped to the field’s knowledge structures and further aggregated into a core and periphery of the network. A burgeoning community of supply chain management academics forms the core along with those with more traditional interests. Male academics affiliated to the US institutions and to business schools predominate in the sample. Research limitations/implications A new strand of research is opened up connecting journal governance networks to knowledge structures in the OSCM field. OM is studied separately from its reference and associated disciplines. The use of the ABS list might attract comments that the study has an implicit European perspective – however the authors do not believe this to be the case. Practical implications The study addresses the implications of the lack of diversity for the practice of OM as an academic discipline. Social implications The confirmation of the dominance of particular characteristics such as male and US-based academics has implications for social diversity of the field. Originality/value As the first study of its kind, i.e. SNA of EAB members of OSCM journals, this study marks out a new perspective and acts as a benchmark for the future.",10.1108/IJOPM-01-2016-0043,"Burgess, Thomas F.; Grimshaw, Paul; Huaccho Huatuco, Luisa; Shaw, Nicola E."

"A systematic review of the factors – Barriers, drivers, and technologies – Affecting e-waste urban mining: On the circular economy future of developing countries",2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8389221363147193,"E-waste, known for its hazardous contents, has gained attention for its use as secondary raw materials. There is evidence that the e-waste sector in developing countries applies various urban mining techniques to recover valuable resources from their waste. Urban mining techniques have shown multiple signs of progress across developing countries. Still, studies have yet to be carried out to examine the state-of-the-art barriers, drivers, or technologies in this field. Furthermore, research on this topic must be more cohesive, multi-faceted, and conclusive. An in-depth review of current practices would improve urban mining's significance and assist in understanding its current implementation levels across developing countries. Based on a systematic review of 45 peer-reviewed articles, this study examines the drivers, barriers, and technologies influencing urban mining techniques in developing countries. In developing countries, urban mining stages are affected by laws, policies, market risks, and technological solutions. Developing countries must sharpen their skills in sustainable technologies, regulatory systems, and policy initiatives to overcome barriers and maximise their returns on urban mining investments. Developing countries must apply systems thinking to establish links across barriers and identify solutions to promote sustainable urban mining practices – a key step towards a circular future for developing countries.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.140645,"Erdiaw-Kwasie, Michael Odei; Abunyewah, Matthew; Baah, Charles"

"Analytic network process in economics, finance and management: Contingency factors, current trends and further research",2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"This study explores the recent use of the Analytic Network Process (ANP) in the decision process in the areas of economics, finance and management to identify common contingency factors, current trends, representative studies and directions for further research applications in the target areas. A systematic literature review of 434 ANP studies for a 10-year period (2012–2021) within the Scopus database was conducted using the keyword “Analytic Network Process” in articles indexed in the following two categories: (1) Business, Management and Accounting, and (2) Economics, Econometrics and Finance. Further analysis using a citation-based graph and contingency analysis approaches was performed to identify usage trends. Our findings indicate that the most common ANP applications are with sustainable supply chain management and business evaluation frameworks. There is also a trend of applications engaging stakeholders in the decision-making process. Finally, it was found that the ANP is most commonly used as part of a multicriteria multi-method (a method followed by others) or integrated decision-making (hybridization of methods) approach rather than alone. The most common use (>80%) of the ANP is as part of a multi-method or integrated method with other tools such as DEMATEL, which suggests these approaches, in particular integrated ones (>50%), are becoming the preferred method of analysis to simplify the ANP process. From a practical point of view, it was found that the ANP is particularly utilized in sustainable projects to facilitate the participation of various stakeholders. This is the first focused review of the use of the ANP in the areas of economics, finance and management with an emphasis on its application as well as its contingent factors. Also, representative studies have been highlighted in each area.

Could AI technologies be harnessed to break down barriers to inclusivity for women entrepreneurship in tourism?,2026,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Despite growing scholarly attention to artificial intelligence (AI) and gender-related challenges in tourism research, a void exists in how the responsible AI could be harnessed to enhance women’s inclusivity in tourism entrepreneurship. Drawing on Rawls’ theory of justice, this study aims to fill this glaring gap by exploring whether and how AI could contribute to fostering a more equitable, inclusive and ethically responsible entrepreneurial ecosystem for women, help break down existing barriers, and thus, support women’s entrepreneurial endeavors in the tourism sector. Based on qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with elite informants, the study highlights significant positive externalities of AI technologies adoption, beyond the generally recognized benefits in customer engagement and personalized offerings, efficiency, and overall performance, to help female entrepreneurs in particular deal with work-life balance predicaments, unanimously considered the most significant barrier to inclusivity. The findings also emphasize how responsible AI design, adoption and governance can help deal with prevalent ethical concerns of AI in tourism, namely, bias, lack of transparency, fairness and privacy, the absence of a human-centered approach, and accountability. The latter two, alongside gender biases, emerge as the ‘most sensitive ethical parameters’ for women’s inclusivity in tourism entrepreneurship. By integrating Rawls’ perspective the study offers a novel analytical lens for understanding how responsible AI can foster a more just and equitable entrepreneurial ecosystem for women in tourism, and for evaluating attendant strategies contributing to sustainable and inclusive growth.

Orchestrating an ecosystem touring approach: united data and mobility as a service,2025,-1,Outliers,0.283673954621924,"Purpose This study proposes a distinct ecosystem orchestration concept, with the idea to address some of the technology and value proposition uncertainties that can occur during the birth phase of an innovation ecosystem linked to its actor’s relation with each other as well as policymakers and customers. In order to better explain the proposed orchestration concept, Mobility as a Service (MaaS), a technological and social complex, innovative ecosystem, was chosen. Design/methodology/approach The suggested touring orchestrating model emerges by utilizing multiple case study analyses, focusing on ecosystem construct, orchestration mechanism, and various actors of five selected mobility as service use cases, each presenting one category with unique characteristics. The analysis is complemented by a multi-vocal literature review (MLR) of secondary data. Findings The study findings reveal substantial barriers to successful collaboration between innovation ecosystem actors, using traditional ways of orchestrating the ecosystem due to competition and unwillingness to invest for the benefit of others or risk of losing their customer base to competitors by joining a MaaS ecosystem, particularly when a new actor as orchestrator is onboarded. Additionally, there is a need to increase incentives and to enhance offerings in order to generate demand and attract stakeholders toward a new innovation ecosystem like MaaS. Research limitations/implications Most of the models reviewed in this study are predominantly successful examples of mobility as a service originating from northern Europe and the Baltic region, potentially shaped by the characteristics of these markets. This regional focus represents a limitation of the study. Furthermore, the study’s conceptual nature and lack of practical testing and empirical data support are additional limitations which could be addressed in future research through empirical investigation. The results of this study could assist in shaping future research and contribute to the development of more effective orchestration models and stakeholder management frameworks for managing innovation ecosystems across different industry contexts. Practical implications The proposed touring orchestration model (TOM) provides insights not only for the actors in transportation industry but also for providers in other industries; on how to manage uncertainties and risks tied to technology and value proposition while advancing seamless cross-firm collaboration with other market actors during the formation of an innovation ecosystem. It can also facilitate the emergence of unexplored cross-industry business models by leveraging various data-sharing frameworks. The proposed model can also streamline processes and lower costs for policymakers in encouraging transportation and mobility providers to participate in MaaS, as it reduces risks and can offer greater financial advantages for these stakeholders. Originality/value The findings of this study enhance the evolving ecosystem literature by exploring orchestration amid technological and value proposition uncertainties. Additionally, this study contributes to the expanding research on MaaS business models and ecosystem orchestration by leveraging data as a service-sharing model.",10.1108/MD-05-2024-1117,"Yahyapour, Nima; Oghazi, Pejvak"

Artificial intelligence and sustainable development goals: Systematic literature review of the construction industry,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7657701121962179,"While acknowledging the widespread recognition of artificial intelligence's (AI) potential in achieving sustainable development, there remains a notable deficiency and thorough examination of its specific applications, impacts, and challenges, particularly within the construction industry. A comprehensive investigation is critical to explore and understand the multifaceted applications of AI in fostering sustainability across all phases of a construction project. This paper aims to examine how AI can be effectively integrated across the key project phases—i.e., planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance, through a systematic literature review to map AI applications, their impacts, adoption challenges, and best practices. The findings revealed: (a) Sustainable development goals (SDGs) pertinent to the construction industry—i.e., SDGs 6-9,11-13,15,17; (b) SDGs that show the highest potential to promote sustainability within the construction industry—i.e., SDGs 7,9,11; (c) Within the spectrum of these goals, AI can potentially transform the construction industry and contribute to the sustainability consideration processes in a more efficient and resilient ways; (d) Ethical considerations, data privacy and security concerns must be addressed, along with an urgent need for specialised training and maintenance of these AI systems; (e) Careful AI implementation and management is essential to harness its full potential, while addressing adoption challenges within the construction sector.",10.1016/j.scs.2024.105499,"Regona, Massimo; Yigitcanlar, Tan; Hon, Carol; Teo, Melissa"
Quantum computing challenges in the software industry. A fuzzy AHP-based approach,2022,-1,Outliers,0.14886553195060984,"Context The current technology revolution has posed unexpected challenges for the software industry. In recent years, the field of quantum computing (QC) technologies has continued to grow in influence and maturity, and it is now poised to revolutionise software engineering. However, the evaluation and prioritisation of QC challenges in the software industry remain unexplored, relatively under-identified and fragmented. Objective The purpose of this study is to identify, examine and prioritise the most critical challenges in the software industry by implementing a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP). Method First, to identify the key challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review by drawing data from the four relevant digital libraries and supplementing these efforts with a forward and backward snowballing search. Second, we followed the F-AHP approach to evaluate and rank the identified challenges, or barriers. Results The results show that the key barriers to QC adoption are the lack of technical expertise, information accuracy and organisational interest in adopting the new process. Another critical barrier is the lack of standards of secure communication techniques for implementing QC. Conclusion By applying F-AHP, we identified institutional barriers as the highest and organisational barriers as the second highest global weight ranked categories among the main QC challenges facing the software industry. We observed that the highest-ranked local barriers facing the software technology industry are the lack of resources for design and initiative while the lack of organisational interest in adopting the new process is the most significant organisational barrier. Our findings, which entail implications for both academicians and practitioners, reveal the emergent nature of QC research and the increasing need for interdisciplinary research to address the identified challenges.",10.1016/j.infsof.2022.106896,"Awan, Usama; Hannola, Lea; Tandon, Anushree; Goyal, Raman Kumar; Dhir, Amandeep"

Blockchain adoption for sustainable development in developing countries: Challenges and opportunities in the banking sector,2023,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Blockchain technology has been gaining relevance in every walk of life. Keeping this relevance in the banking sector, the current study aims to synthesize the body of knowledge on blockchain adoption for sustainability in developing countries while encapsulating challenges and opportunities using a systematic literature review. It offers a review of scholarly published articles published between 2010 and 2022 in EBSCO, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The findings of the study revealed that scalability, the lack of operability among the blockchain service providers, and the absence of favorable regulatory laws and generally accepted rules were the major hurdles in the way of blockchain adoption in developing countries. Implantation of smart contracts, risk management, risk mitigation and faster payment are the opportunities for the banking sectors of developing countries to increase trust and transparency in their financial systems as well as formalization of their economy.

Towards mining 4.0: A novel multi-criteria simulation-optimization fuzzy framework for effective slag utilization overcoming green waste management promotion,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"The transition to Mining 4.0 requires robust waste management strategies. A critical research gap exists in understanding novel waste utilization techniques and their associated societal implications. This study proposes a comprehensive assessment framework that incorporates criteria of economic, technical, environmental, energy&water, regulations&policy, social, and resiliency. Thirty sustainability indicators were evaluated across nineteen potential slag utilization alternatives. To determine the weights of criteria and indicators, three advanced Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) methods including Spherical F-AHP (SF-AHP), interval-valued Pythagorean F-AHP (IVPF-AHP), and randomized weighted F-AHP (RWF-AHP) were compared and the optimal method was identified. Moreover, a novel Fuzzy-Likert Scaling Analysis (FLSA) was proposed to prioritize alternatives. FLSA compared different membership functions (MFs) of triangular, Pythagorean, parabolic, and eighth-order polynomials to find the best MFs. By combining optimized F-AHP, fuzzy-Delphi method (FDM), and FLSA, the framework provides a measurable Slag Management Sustainability Score (SMSS). In a case study examining optimal strategic planning for supplying steel slags, Foolad Mobarakeh Company (FMC) was selected. The most sustainable alternative, “Feed for factories,” achieved an SMSS of 63.633 and 65.049 based on SF-AHP and RWF-AHP, respectively. This framework offers a practical and versatile solution for Mining 4.0, fostering a greener future through sustainable and optimal waste management.",10.1016/j.techfore.2025.124271,"Shamsi, Mohammad; Zakerinejad, Mohammad"
"Application of Integrated Building Information Modeling, IoT and Blockchain Technologies in System Design of a Smart Building",2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7120016404771377,"The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has not adopted digital transformation enthusiastically like other industries, for instance, manufacturing, aerospace or finance. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an innovative technology that is considered as an opportunity for the AEC industry to move to the digital era and improve the collaboration among stakeholders by applying Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). BIM provides all required tools and automations to achieve end-to-end communication, data exchange and information sharing among collaborators. Accordingly, virtual 3D models, created by the BIM process, delivered as physical assets, monitored in real-time and managed using Building Management Systems (BMS), can adopt the Internet of Things (IoT) designs and services. However, the implementation of IoT in a highly modular environment with various moving parts and inter-dependencies between stakeholders leads to security concerns. Therefore, this paper proposes system design that employs the blockchain technology as a measure to secure and control the framework that involves integrated IoT and BIM technologies. Although this paper considers system design applied in a smart museum, the authors assume that design is generic and applicable in other building categories. For instance, this design can be implemented in the ongoing Alumni Hall renovation project at State University of New York College at Oneonta.",10.1016/j.procs.2019.11.058,"Lokshina, Izabella V.; Greguš, Michal; Thomas, Wade L."
Business intelligence and cognitive loads: Proposition of a dashboard adoption model,2024,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.14150583861707722,"Decision makers in organizations strive to improve the quality of their decisions. One way to improve that process is to objectify the decisions with facts. Data-driven Decision Support Systems (data-driven DSS), and more specifically business intelligence (BI) intend to achieve this. Organizations invest massively in the development of BI data-driven DSS and expect them to be adopted and to effectively support decision makers. This raises many technical and methodological challenges, especially regarding the design of BI dashboards, which can be seen as the visible tip of the BI data-driven DSS iceberg and which play a major role in the adoption of the entire system. In this paper, the dashboard content is investigated as one possible root cause for BI data-driven DSS dashboard adoption or rejection through an early empirical research. More precisely, this work is composed of three parts. In the first part, the concept of cognitive loads is studied in the context of BI dashboards and the informational, the representational and the non-informational loads are introduced. In the second part, the effects of these loads on the adoption of BI dashboards are then studied through an experiment with 167 respondents and a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis. The result is a Dashboard Adoption Model, enriching the seminal Technology Acceptance Model with new content-oriented variables to support the design of more supportive BI data-driven DSS dashboards. Finally, in the third part, a set of indicators is proposed to help dashboards designers in the monitoring of the loads of their dashboards practically.",10.1016/j.datak.2024.102310,"Burnay, Corentin; Lega, Mathieu; Bouraga, Sarah"
"Zero carbon urban buildings (ZCUBs) in the era of climate change, digital transformation and energy transition: a scoping review from 2000 to 2024",2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.5878920332929128,"As the global drive for carbon neutrality becomes the new normal, Zero Carbon Urban Buildings (ZCUBs) are positioned as an essential pillar in the fight against global warming. Given the absence of a scoping literature review focused on recent progress in ZCUBs, this research paper aims to provide reference and support for their wider implementation. Using the PRISMA protocol, 226 articles spanning the period from 2000 to 2024 were selected and classified thematically, identifying key drivers, strategies, and the influential factors on energy and environmental performances, carbon emissions, and overall sustainability impacts on urban built environments. Based on the findings from a scientometric analysis of the past 25 years (2000–2024), the approach to urban building’s design and performance has undergone a remarkable transformation. Initially, efforts were concentrated on improving energy efficiency to reduce energy consumption and enhance the comfort of individual buildings. However, as the realities of climate change have intensified and digital advancements -especially in the Artificial Intelligence field- have triggered tectonic shifts in all fields of science including the building sector, the scope has expanded significantly. Buildings are now designed not only to optimize energy use and enhance indoor comfort but also to minimize building’s life cycle carbon emissions (LCCEs) and actively incorporate renewable energy sources, while considering their urban contexts. This evolution is driven by stricter regulatory and legal obligations along with the development of advanced technologies and digital tools, enabling urban buildings to transition from passive energy consumers to active, sustainable grid-interactive prosumers. As part of smart grid deployment, this shift enables urban buildings to achieve net-zero or even net-positive energy status, within the context of zero-energy communities, in a very radically different way than it is today. From this perspective, ZCUB's design broadly covers embodied carbon in construction materials, passive and active energy efficiency measures, on-site and/or off-site renewable energy sources’ adoption, and integration with urban energy systems and infrastructure. It also encompasses digital tools for energy and environmental performance simulations, lifecycle assessment methodologies, technological innovations and policy frameworks that support decarbonization at urban building’s scale. That said, considering the broad disciplinary landscape of ZCUBs, this scoping review identifies common trends and challenges, highlights gaps in the existing literature, and proposes future research directions aimed at advancing carbon neutrality within the building sector and its wider urban context.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2025.113116,"Idrissi Kaitouni, Samir; Romani, Zaid; Jamil, Abdelmajid; Ahachad, Mohammed"
"Hyperconnected, receptive and do-it-yourself city. An investigation into the European “imaginary” of crowdsourcing for urban governance",2020,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"This paper critically explores the construction and diffusion of the socio-technical imaginary of crowdsourcing for public governance in Europe via a quali-quantitative analysis of academic publications, research and innovation projects funded by the European Commission (EC) and local initiatives. Building upon the increasing narrative of digital social participation that describes crowdsourcing processes as short ways towards democratisation of public decision-making processes, our research describes the trends and threats associated with the “hyperconnected city” imaginary advanced by (part of) scholarly research and EC policy documents and projects. We show how, while these last describe digital-supported participation processes as (at least potentially) able to bootstrap an open governance agenda, local urban initiatives suggest the need to question this technology-optimistic imaginary. A critical analysis of crowdsourcing for public governance prototyped and piloted in some European cities makes it evident that at local level, alternative imaginaries are emerging. We describe them in this paper as the “receptive city” (often adopted by public institutions and administration), and the “do-it-yourself city” (referring to the critical perspective of (digital) social activists) imaginaries, both emerging from local-based experiences and debates; and clarify their convergence and divergence how these differs from the above-mentioned “hyperconnected city” imaginary prefigured by EC guidelines.

Digitalizing land administration: The geographies and temporalities of infrastructural promise,2021,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Blockchain technology has been explored recently for digitalizing land administration in different parts of the world. It has been viewed as contributing to formalization of property rights in the Global South, and enhancing coordination of real estate markets in the Global North. Suggesting that blockchain applications may entail an unrealistic promise of effecting change in property relations through technical means, the article explores the integration of blockchain with existing modes of land administration in three countries – Ghana, Georgia, and Sweden. It investigates the broader embeddedness of blockchain-based land registries in non-digital infrastructural modalities and the peopled infrastructures of informal networks. It argues that the abstraction of blockchain may obscure the complex layering of formal and informal, institutionalized and grassroots texture of property rights and claims to land.

Best practice is not just “best”: An empirical study based on judges’ perceptions,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.40963566970914395,"This paper proposes five major criteria—importance, innovativeness, effectiveness, sustainability and replicability—for determining best practices in public management. The influence of each criterion on the probability that a judge recommends a case as a best practice is examined using data from the first Best Practice Cases for Urban Governance in the Yangtze River Delta competition. The results show that perceptions of innovativeness, effectiveness, sustainability and replicability, but not of importance, significantly influence judges’ recommendations. These findings demonstrate that innovativeness, sustainability and replicability are important in evaluations of best practices, in addition to effectiveness. Specifically, innovativeness is as important as effectiveness, which indicates that judges perceive innovation to be closely linked to best practices. In addition, the empirical results partly refute the criticism that sustainability and replicability are not considered in evaluations of best practices. This paper can serve to inspire public management practitioners to consider the innovativeness, effectiveness, sustainability and replicability when developing best practices.",10.1016/j.ugj.2023.03.005,"Wu, Jiannan; Liu, Yao; Bretschneider, Stuart"
"Governing eco-cities in China: Urban climate experimentation, international cooperation, and multilevel governance",2021,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7679943663911704,"International cooperation has become an important element of urban climate experimentation, particularly in developing countries. Using the Sino-German Eco-Park in Qingdao as a case study, we argue that while multilevel governance and international cooperation are often discussed separately, these two governance tendencies are in fact both important to China’s urban climate experimentation. In particular, Chinese multilevel governance enables bilateral cooperation by (re)shaping the national vision at the local level and resolving potential conflicts or contradictions. It also allows local and foreign intermediaries to coordinate and match resources among different interests and actors. The effectiveness of multilevel governance in eco-city projects is conditioned by intermediary institutions’ resources and capabilities. Effectiveness also depends on maintaining the attention of national governments to the eco-city projects. Thus, the cooperative form, the actors’ attributes, and the resources mobilised by actors are three important factors that affect the outcomes of international eco-city projects.",10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.02.017,"Liu, Minsi; Lo, Kevin"

"A taxonomy study on securing Blockchain-based Industrial applications: An overview, application perspectives, requirements, attacks, countermeasures, and open issues",2022,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Blockchain technology has taken on a leading position in today’s industrial applications by providing salient features and showing significant performance since its beginning. Blockchain began its journey from the concept of cryptocurrency and is now part of a range of core applications to achieve resilience and automation between various tasks. However, with the integration of Blockchain technology into different industrial applications, many application designs, security, and privacy challenges present themselves, posing serious threats to users and their data. Although several approaches have been proposed to address the specific application, security and privacy challenges of targeted applications with limited security enhancement solutions, there is still a need for a comprehensive research study on the application design, security and privacy challenges, and requirements of Blockchain-based industrial applications, along with possible security threats and countermeasures. This study presents a comprehensive and state-of-the-art survey of Blockchain-based Industry 4.0 applications, focusing on potential application design, security and privacy requirements, as well as corresponding attacks on Blockchain systems with potential countermeasures. We also analyse and provide the classification of security and privacy techniques used in these applications to enhance the advancement of security features. Furthermore, we highlight some open issues of integrating Blockchain technology into industrial applications that help design secure Blockchain-based applications as future directions.",10.1016/j.jii.2021.100312,"Hameed, Khizar; Barika, Mutaz; Garg, Saurabh; Amin, Muhammad Bilal; Kang, Byeong"
Contribution of procurement capacity of public agencies to attainment of procurement objectives in infrastructure procurement,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Purpose Effective procurement of infrastructure is linked to the attainment of the sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. While the capacity of organisations is generally thought to be related to organisational performance, there is a lack of empirical insights concerning the contribution of procurement capacity of public organisations towards the attainment of procurement objectives in infrastructure procurement. Thus, it is unclear which aspects of the capacity of public procurement organisations contribute the most to the attainment of procurement objectives in the procurement of infrastructure. This research sought to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach The research used a survey of public procurement professionals which yielded 590 responses. Findings Exploratory factor analysis of 23 organisational capacity items revealed three components of organisational procurement capacity: “management of the procurement process”; “human and physical resources”; and “financial resources and management”. Multiple regression modelling of the relationship between the components and the attainment of 12 procurement objectives further reveals that there is a significant positive relationship between the three components and all the objectives. However, “management of the procurement process” emerged as the greatest contributor to the attainment of seven objectives, whereas “human and physical resources”, and “financial resources and management” were the greatest contributor to the attainment of one objective and four objectives, respectively. Originality/value The study provides strong empirical justification for investment in the development of procurement capacity of public agencies involved in procurement of infrastructure. Furthermore, procurement capacity development of specific capacity components can be prioritised based on the relative contribution of capacity components to the attainment of desired procurement objectives. This should be useful to government policymakers as well as multilateral organisations that fund infrastructure and procurement reforms in various countries.",10.1108/ECAM-05-2020-0375,"Manu, Patrick; Asiedu, Richard Ohene; Mahamadu, Abdul-Majeed; Olomolaiye, Paul Olaniyi; Booth, Colin; Manu, Emmanuel; Ajayi, Saheed; Agyekum, Kofi"
Income-related unmet needs in the European countries,2023,-1,Outliers,0.11131430801628209,"This paper proposes an assessment of the association between income and unmet health needs in 29 European countries included in the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) in 2015. Income-related inequalities for four categories of unmet needs are estimated by the Erreygers Index (EI). Unmet needs are organised into two categories: on the one side, unmet needs directly associated with households’ budget constraints; on the other side, unmet needs not directly associated with budget constraints, as waiting lists and transportation problems. Results show that all categories of unmet needs fall on lower-income people for most European systems. Furthermore, when analysing the determinants of unmet needs, those directly associated with budget constraints are led by the economic drivers, while income-related unmet needs due to long waiting lists and distance or transportation problems are more related to institutional factors such as the low quality of government.",10.1016/j.seps.2023.101542,"Carnazza, Giovanni; Liberati, Paolo; Resce, Giuliano"
Exploring blockchain in the accounting domain: a bibliometric analysis,2021,-1,Outliers,0.10822705907566985,"Purpose Considering the growing interests in managerial and accounting issues related to blockchain technology (BT), the study aims at identifying the main research venues in this specific field. In particular, the purpose is to understand the spatial and temporal production and distribution of research documents, highlighting the most relevant topics, the most influential authors and research. Design/methodology/approach This research carries out a bibliometric analysis of 189 research documents in the business, management and accounting areas. Data collection and refining is carried out from the Scopus database. The data analysis is based on a hybrid literature review approach using a descriptive bibliometric method, data analysis visualization (through VOSViewer software) and thematic analysis. Findings Results indicate that research studies focused on BT and accounting have been growing exponentially over the last three years, with authors who previously focused on generalist themes, and are now facing more specific issues. Through cluster analysis, the authors propose the framework of accounting domain and blockchain technology (ADOB) to systematize and visualize the map of current studies about the BT in the accounting domain. Research limitations/implications The analysis highlights some aspects less investigated at the first research stage in the field of BT and accounting, such as the growing need of new accounting and control processes to address the practical issues of BT implementation and the need for education and training to stimulate a proper use of BT by accountants and practitioners.

Enchanting performance measurement and management with data envelopment analysis: Insights from bibliometric data visualization and analysis,2023,-1,Outliers,0.18440988975960773,"While the breadth of applicative uses of data envelopment analysis (DEA) has increased over time, this non-parametric frontier methodology has proven effective for measuring how efficient decision-making units (DMUs) are. One of its uses is performance measurement in various organizations — from universities and banks to investment funds and entrepreneurial small and medium-sized enterprises. Following a search inquiry in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, we found no bibliometric analysis and keyword co-occurrence network visualization of just the use of DEA for performance management. With this study, we attempt to investigate the DEA literature for performance measurement and management, considering articles in scientific peer-reviewed journals, which are indexed in the Web of Science database. The analysis and visualization of the bibliometric data are based on 89 articles from the start of the century onward. We present the annual trends of published articles, journals, authors, and countries leading the scientific discussion and citation analysis.

A Preliminary multidimensional AI readiness assessment model for SME’s,2025,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.3658141199783967,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the world by integrating the digital and physical worlds. Modern businesses utilize AI systems to optimize their operations, make strategic decisions and to enhance quality etc. On the other hand, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) constitute a sizeable portion of the global economy and are the main drivers of economic development. The highly saturated market of SMEs demands them to adopt innovative digital technologies to stay competitive. However, there are various challenges including ethics, transparency, privacy, biases, financial limitations, infrastructural incapacity, and others associated with the adoption of AI. Most SMEs are unable to measure AI readiness since it is a multi-faceted procedure that requires developing a multidimensional construct with variable elements. Therefore, this work proposes a Technology-Organization-Environment-Human (TOEH) framework that comprehensively captures the possible dimensions of AI readiness and their related elements. The model carries out this evaluation at the micro level by assessing the attributes of all dimensional elements for each of the four dimensions. In the pr-assessment phase, severity index for each attribute of the dimensional elements is formulated through expert review that serves as a metric to assess AI readiness. In the assessment phase, firm’s capabilities are identified through a comprehensive questionnaire and each of the dimensional elements is assigned a readiness state (informal, struggling, approaching and desirable state). Based upon the state of these dimensional elements and the pre-determined severity ratings, a readiness rating is assigned to the four dimensions. The proposed model is also capable of suggesting a comprehensive action plan based on the organizational inadequacies. It is iterative that requires SMEs to reassess their readiness until it achieve the desired or required readiness state.",10.1016/j.procs.2025.01.139,"Naheed, Saqib; Pinto, Roberto; Pirola, Fabiana"

Responsible innovation ecosystems: Ethical implications of the application of the ecosystem concept to artificial intelligence,2022,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"The concept of innovation ecosystems has become prominent due to its explanatory power. It offers a convincing account of innovation, explaining how and why innovation pathways change and evolve. It has been adopted to explain, predict, and steer innovation. The increasing importance of innovation for most aspects of human life calls for the inclusion of ethical and social rights aspects into the innovation ecosystems discourse. The current innovation ecosystems literature does not provide guidance on how the integration of ethical and social concerns into innovation ecosystems can be realised. One way to achieve this is to draw on the discussion of responsible research and innovation (RRI). This paper applies RRI to the innovation ecosystems discourse and proposes the concept of responsible innovation systems. It draws on the discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) to explore how responsible AI innovation ecosystems can be shaped and realised.",10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102441,"STAHL, Bernd Carsten"
A systematic review on barriers and enablers toward circular procurement management,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8924021579211645,"In the last couple of years, circular supply chain management considered the most significant tool for the circular economy. It supports converting production and consumption patterns from linear to sustainable. Several studies have covered the implementation of circularity in different settings, but no concrete investigation exists that in-depth and explicitly explores the procurement perspective toward the circular economy. Previous studies also highlighted the need to focus on procurement or supply management perspective because it consumed an ample amount of budget in the public and private sector. To fill this gap, this study provides a state-of-the-art analysis to adopt circularity in procurement operations. This comprehensive analysis had done by reviewing the 100 peer-reviewed research papers related to the implementation of circular economy and sustainable procurement. This study not just covered the top-down view of literature but advances the literature by finding 55 barriers and enablers under different clusters. From the output, it is evident that efforts need to be taken from 360-degree stakeholders. However, sourcing strategy and procurement operations need to be revamped. This review unpacks the factors at the micro, meso, and macro-level that help academicians to create a framework for empirical investigation. Similarly, it helps practitioners, policymakers, and decision makers to achieve sustainable development goal (SDG) number 12 by incorporating circularity in procurement.",10.1016/j.spc.2022.07.013,"Qazi, Asad Ali; Appolloni, Andrea"
Central–local state strategic coupling towards making entrepreneurial cities in China,2024,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.702106932542228,"The temporal and geographic varieties of entrepreneurial urban governance have sparked considerable debate. A key research gap that remains unfilled is the role of national states in the transition of urban governance from a singular logic of growth. This paper attempts to reveal how the national state and its top-down territorial logic shape this transition in China. Based on a theoretical engagement between political and economic geographers' approaches to city-regional development, we conceptualise a ‘central-local state strategic coupling’ between national geopolitical goals and local entrepreneurial strategies. We argue that municipalities endeavour to plug their city-regions into national geopolitical strategies to unlock the resources (e.g., land and financial capital) necessary for the implementation of local entrepreneurial strategies. The central state strategically selects certain city-regions to develop by privileging their municipalities' access to key resources to facilitate local entrepreneurial strategies. Thus, the central state aligns city-regional development/transformation to its geopolitical goals/strategies in a subtle and depoliticised manner. We substantiate this argument by taking local economic space production as a lens, with a comparative analysis of the emerging urban entrepreneurial/economic space production strategies in three Chinese inland cities.",10.1016/j.polgeo.2024.103062,"Zhang, Mengzhu; Xu, Jiang"

Systematic literature review on business process re-engineering approaches in logistics,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Purpose BPR is “the central reconsideration and thorough restructuring of business procedures to enhance the critical and contemporary aspects of performance like the expense, quality, service, and speed”. Also, as it's a key factor for guaranteeing businesses' achievement, however, the profound discussion about the BPR is very rare as far as we know. We need more studies regarding the subject due to the absence of BPR works in the logistics industry. Hence, this study investigates the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of BPR for logistics companies, leading the managers and writers active in BPR, and making them aware of the present, past and future trends in this discipline. Design/methodology/approach As BPR is a necessary foundation for ensuring enterprise systems' success, this study will systematically investigate the BPR in logistics. The proposed BPR in logistics research classification framework is based on a comprehensive literature review, which concentrates on peer-reviewed journal papers published until 2019. A total of 22 academic sources have been retrieved and analyzed in terms of research purpose and nature, the employed method, theoretical approach and analysis level. Findings The findings of this paper showed that BPR companies outperform the non-BPR ones regarding information computing, technology uses, organizational architecture, coordination and all key logistics procedures. The results can motivate non-BPR logistics organizations to reassess the feasibility of these plans. Research limitations/implications This paper provides an overview of BPR to young academics. Also, it identifies some distinct research gaps that could be worth studying. However, this paper may be restricted by choice of dimensions and the selection of relevant articles. In turn, researchers need to become more innovative in terms of their research techniques when examining BPR implementation. Practical implications This paper guides researchers and practitioners to insight into published research work and their findings. The findings are valuable to logistics firms in an emerging market, as logistics resources may affect logistics service costs and quality. Also, it discusses indications for future research in BPR. It emphasizes the need to bridge the lacuna between BPR theory and evidence-based practice. Furthermore, it provides a better understanding of BPR implementation, which can be applied toward overcoming operational difficulties during the implementation process. Originality/value This paper fulfills an identified need for a comprehensive classification framework of BPR in logistics studies. We can consider it as the first-evaluated methodically gathered workaround BPR in logistics. It essentially provides both academics and practitioners with a conceptual map of existing BPR in logistics research and points out future research opportunities.",10.1108/K-09-2020-0579,"Li, Na; Nazif, Habibeh"
"Early retired or automatized? Evidence from the survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe",2023,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.30604694823364,"This paper measures the implications of the automation process in the labour market for the early retirement decisions in 26 European countries. In order to perform the analysis, we use microdata from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, occupation-level data on automation degree and automation risk and a technological classification of occupations in 4 terrains. We find that the current technological change is playing a significant role in the early retirement decisions, although it affects heterogeneously certain groups in the sample (regarding gender, education level and job status). This fact leads to a contradiction between governments trying to delay retirement ages and labour markets trying to expel workers earlier. Therefore, we conclude that, in order to elaborate policies on ageing and retirement, the effect of new labour-saving technologies in older worker’s decisions must be taken into account. We propose that the delay in statutory retirement ages should be accompanied by training programs and/or policies promoting self-employment for workers at risk of ending their working lives prematurely. Furthermore, the programs aimed to relocate middle-age workers displaced from their original occupations should focus on finding a new occupation among those which are less affected by automation processes.",10.1016/j.jeoa.2023.100443,"Casas, Pablo; Román, Concepción"

Empathy in public relations practice of South Korea,2024,3,Topic_3_social_media_social media,0.34847096936663313,"Using a qualitative approach, this study explores the role of empathy as a critical skill that can improve public relations practice. Specifically, it investigates how South Korean public relations practitioners perceive the role of empathy based on their life and work experiences, beliefs, and feelings. This theme is considered within the context of the Korean culture of Shim-Cheong, a state focused on “we-ness,” and Cheong. The study results reveal three important aspects of empathy for public relations practitioners: 1) an empathic appraisal that allows evaluation of public emotions, 2) a sensitivity that enables detection of/predicts a change in public mood, and 3) sympathetic arousal that ensures sincere communication of empathy in a crisis. When the public perceives organizations and their issues as problematic, public affect changes from positive to negative. Empathy as capacity, intuition, and attitude allows public relations practitioners to determine when public affect has significantly changed South Koreans in the culture of Shim-Cheong. Since South Koreans tend to express positive moods more readily than negative emotions, practitioners can use an affect monitoring system to identify social trends and perform more in-depth analyses to assess contextual meanings and identify potential risks.",10.1016/j.pubrev.2024.102506,"Doh, Hyunji; Kang, Jiyoung; Jo, Samsup"

Previous reviews usually examined FSCs without discussing accessibility, or discussed accessibility outside the FSC context. We close that gap by making the first systematic review that explicitly links the two topics. We screened 136 studies and conducted bibliometric-performance and science-mapping analyses to identify research topics and trends. We synthesized diverse definitions and measurements of food accessibility, analyzed barriers affecting food accessibility, and established a three-tier taxonomy that maps specific barriers onto the three dimensions of food accessibility and five barrier classes. For each barrier class, we traced the causal chain and summarized the interventions reported in the literature. A brief comparison between sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe shows that barriers and interventions vary by region. Based on these findings, we present a decision matrix that links barriers to actionable interventions and analytical tools. The review identifies three research gaps: (1) multidimensional measurement of accessibility, (2) stronger attention to equity, and (3) wider use of analytics-driven decision support tools.

Chartered status and public relations' struggle for legitimacy,2020,-1,Outliers,0.08764319873635605,"Purpose To appraise progress towards “the professional project” for the public relations profession in the UK using the Royal Charter application as a pivotal assessment point in the journey. Design/methodology/approach Primary and secondary, qualitative research, with participant observation and chronological and thematic analysis of archival documents at the time of the Charter process: 2003 to 2005. Two expert interviews were also conducted for a view on progress. The study is contextualised within the professions literature and the 2019 State of the Profession study undertaken by the Chartered Institute of Public Relations. Findings The Institute faced significant challenges during the Charter application raised by Institutions such as the Government Department for Education and Skills, including the diversity of the profession, standards of education and training, practitioner standards, including ethical, as indicated by their levels of membership and commitment to ongoing professional development. These challenges remain. Research limitations/implications Diversity, social acceptance, qualifications and professional progress provide an important, ongoing research agenda. Practical implications Social acceptance, qualifications and professional progress remain elusive for the practice and more radical action is required to achieve progress. Social implications The profession is making limited progress towards legitimacy. Continued press ambivalence, recent scandals, such as the Bell Pottinger affair in South Africa and jurisdictional infringement by other professions continue to threaten its attempts to move towards social closure.

Industry 4.0: A bibliometric review of its managerial intellectual structure and potential evolution in the service industries,2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.552015273132857,"The “industry 4.0"" phenomenon is expected to influence almost every aspect of business value chains, and hence it has been increasingly analyzed by management scholars. However, the overarching intellectual structure emerging from this new stream of literature has not yet been synthesized in a framework nor critically discussed. Furthermore, despite being part of the rhetoric in several recent industrial governmental plans, industry 4.0 in service sectors has not been systematically reviewed to date. By leveraging a systematic quantitative literature review, a data-driven approach and a quantitative methodology—embedding both bibliographic coupling and network analysis techniques—this study provides a clear visualization of the emerging intellectual structure of industry 4.0 in management studies. We also develop a framework based on the most recurrent themes emerging from the results of bibliometric and network analyses—the latter could be used by management scholars to understand studies surrounding industry 4.0. As service businesses can create and capture value generated through the 4th Industrial Revolution as well as manufacturing firms, we suggest that scholarly attention should also be directed toward the service industries and provide a research agenda.",10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119752,"Mariani, Marcello; Borghi, Matteo"

Software architectures of the convergence of cloud computing and the Internet of Things: A systematic literature review,2020,-1,Outliers,0.3582523144124145,"Context Over the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in the convergence of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although software systems in this domain have attracted researchers to develop a large body of knowledge on software architecture designs, there is no systematic analysis of this knowledge. Objective This study aims to identify and synthesise state-of-the-art architectural elements including the design patterns, styles, views, quality attributes, and evaluation methodologies in the convergence of cloud computing and IoT. Method We used systematic literature review (SLR) methodology for a detailed analysis of 82 primary studies of a total of 1618 studies. Results We extracted six architectural design patterns in this domain; among them, edge connectivity patterns stand out as the most popular choice. The service-oriented architecture is the most frequently applied style in this context. Among all applicable quality attributes, scalability, timeliness, and security were the most investigated quality attributes. In addition, we included nine cross analyses to address the relationship between architectural patterns, styles, views, and evaluation methodologies with respect to different quality attributes and application areas. Conclusions Our findings indicate that research on software architectures in this domain is increasing. Although few studies were found in which industrial evaluations were presented, industry requires more scientific and empirically validated design frameworks to guide software engineering in this domain.

Unveiling the knowledge structure of technological forecasting and social change (1969–2020) through an NMF-based hierarchical topic model,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.20220351206932738,"This article examines the knowledge structure of the journal Technology Forecasting and Social Change (TFSC) from its inception in 1969 until 2020. In this paper we argue that the structure of knowledge in the field of technological forecasting is more complex than a topic model – a bag of words – can in fact effectively reveal. Therefore we propose and demonstrate a hierarchical model that selectively combines topics at varying levels of generality. The resultant analysis, which is based on non-negative matrix factorization, reveals four distinct branches of technology forecasting work, composed of seven distinct topics. Each topic and branch are examined individually through a detailed examination of terms and keywords. Representative works and authors in each of the branches are also identified. The method enables the examination of the complex structure of knowledge in a scientific journal in a succinct representation.

To improve resilience and sustainability in five major areas decentralized energy systems, ocean energy, carbon capture technologies, green chemistry, and waste management. This paper has examined significant developments in green technologies focusing on microgrids and decentralized energy systems, which have transformed energy production by encouraging independent, sustainable, and local power sources. There is a lot of unrealized potential for producing clean energy from waves and tides using ocean energy, an underutilized renewable resource. In Addition, the effectiveness of carbon capture technologies in lowering industrial carbon emissions and its possible influence on attempts to mitigate climate change have been examined. Green chemistry has been highlighted for its potential to revolutionize conventional production by reducing waste and toxic chemicals, while advancements in waste management have been acknowledged for their ability to transform waste into useful resources by means of procedures like energy recovery and recycling.

Introducing real estate led start-up urbanism: An account from Greater Paris,2022,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"In the past few years, calls for innovative urban projects (CIUPs) have become the most mediatized symbol of the ongoing transformations within the public-led French urban development system. In the name of urban innovation, CIUP is a policy instrument that brings together, early in the design phase of urban development projects, extended teams of real estate developers and other actors who usually intervene downstream in the development process. We explore these calls as a form of real estate led start-up urbanism and analyse its modalities in Greater Paris, with the first edition of the Inventing the Greater Paris Metropolis (IGPM) call as a case study. We begin by tracing the genealogy of CIUPs and their particular articulation of urban innovation and urban development principles. In the remainder of the paper, we explore the implications of such urban innovation and spatial planning hybrids, by honing in on the relational work of real estate developers, i.e. the production of social relationships and networks that enables real estate developers adherence to the political ambitions during the bidding process. After establishing their centrality in the social networks defined by IGPM, we explore the apparent paradox between projects that are perceived as ordinary by call organizers and a visible effervescence of the urban planning milieu, including recruitment practices within real estate development firms, the emergence of small operators embodying imaginaries of urban innovation and the growing role of consultancies in supporting developers in responding to public authorities’ ambitions. In the final empirical section of the paper, we focus on real estate developers’ innovation strategies as a way of understanding the apparent contradiction between project content and the changing organizational landscape of the urban development milieu. In the concluding section, we bring these elements together through a discussion of the policy outputs and outcomes of CIUPs in general, and of IGPM in particular.",10.1016/j.progress.2021.100625,"Gomes, Pedro; Pérès, Yoann"

A systematic literature review on Circular Economy implementation in the construction industry: a policy-making perspective,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Implementing Circular Economy (CE) is a promising solution to tackle environmental challenges in the construction industry. On the way towards a circular built environment, governmental policy support is viewed as an important enabler. However, most existing policies are insufficient to address complex CE challenges and there are substantial knowledge gaps in understanding CE policy-making from a systemic perspective in the construction industry. This literature review investigates construction CE based on the five-stage policy cycle developed in the domain of public policy. Our main finding is that there is a lack of integrated policy-making frameworks to manage construction projects based on CE. The five-stage-policy model is not widely recognized by scientific communities or industrial practitioners to understand CE policy-making as a dynamic, interactive, and iterative cycle. Therefore, we propose an integrated CE policy-making cycle based on the explicit alignment between the state-of-the-art and the classical policy model. Furthermore, the lack of policy integration is considered as one of the critical research gaps and we propose a bi-directional policy-making mechanism to conceptualize the integrated processes of policy implementation and evaluation. The proposed frameworks address current knowledge gaps and serve as theoretical guidelines for public and private actors to understand more complex CE policy-making in the reality. Finally, we encourage interdisciplinary research to enhance integrated CE policy-making in the construction industry by 1) exploring the synergistic effect of CE policy packages on the construction life cycle, and 2) creating a streamlined, transparent, and collaborative policy-making environment based on Information & Communication Technologies.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.106359,"Yu, Yifei; Junjan, Veronica; Yazan, Devrim Murat; Iacob, Maria-Eugenia"

At first, we focused on the problem of missing leaders of digital transformation; thus, we created, delivered, and assessed a novel course focusing on agile and strategic thinking. We incorporated two new features into the course that brought agility and strategic thinking into play – 1) shuffling of the project tasks within groups, and 2) changes in the size and composition of groups during the project. Within the second perspective, we broadened our view and developed the theoretical framework comprising the necessary steps to prepare courses and study programs that respect labor market requirements. This framework is based on action research and design thinking. Our results show that the Curriculum Development and Redesign Framework (CDRF) proved to be useful tool. Students’ perception of task shuffling was overall positive. Only 5.3 % of students answered, “Handing over projects bothered me.” Changes in the size and composition of groups also brought positive results. 43.2 % of students answered, “I am happy, I met new people,” 54 % answered, “It went pretty well,” and just 2.8 % answered, “I did not like it.""",10.1016/j.ijme.2024.100943,"Kopackova, Hana; Simonova, Stanislava; Reimannova, Irena"

Paving the Green Path: A Maturity Model for Digital Decarbonization,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Digital transformation has been employed across all industries to enhance business operations. Its potential lies in optimising existing business models and creating innovative ones based on various technologies, making them fit for the future by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fulfilling future decarbonization goals. In order to ensure a successful digital transformation towards decarbonization, managers have to assess the capabilities of their organisation and competently oversee their journey by defining a clear path employing digital maturity models. For this purpose, the analysis focused on published literature concerning digital maturity models developed to guide organisations in navigating their digital transformation journey. A systematic literature review of 36 selected digital maturity models is presented in this paper. These models overlook decarbonisation measures and focus solely on demonstrating digital capabilities, efficiency and profit growth. Therefore, a maturity model for digital decarbonization encompassing dimensions of decarbonization goals, business model innovation, customers and suppliers, products and services, employees, collaboration, processes and activities, data, and IT-infrastructure, -security and -technology has been developed. It assists organisations in reducing their carbon footprint by strategically and effectively leveraging digital technologies. The proposed model has five maturity levels: assess and align, engage and refine, innovate and collaborate, optimize and personalize, and transform and decarbonize. This paper aims to assess the current level of digital decarbonization and determine the position of the organizations. Additionally, it endeavours to identify the specific opportunities for growth that digitalization presents, thereby enabling the creation of a new digital carbon-free existence.",10.1016/j.procir.2024.10.201,"Abdulghani, Tamer; Abdelkafi, Nizar; Lange, Hans-Rüdiger; Winkler, Herwig"
The integration of circular economy with sustainable consumption and production tools: Systematic review and future research agenda,2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8455160842898749,"Circular economy (CE) has become worldwide an effective pathway for sustainable development against the linear model. Sustainable consumption and production (SCP) tools have been identified either as booster of circularity and as supporter for the achievement of sustainable development goals. Environmental Management System (EMS), Green Public Procurement (GPP), Ecodesign Directive, Ecolabel, Energy Label and Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) have been considered either by academic and practitioners as tools useful to promote CE. Although the attention on SCP tools and CE has growth, no studies have investigated the linkages between these two topics. To bridge this gap, the aim of this study is to provide a literature review on the integration between CE and SCP tools. The revisited material consisted of 455 studies and was evaluated using a systematic approach. By critically analysing 35 papers, the study identified EMS and Ecodesign as the tools with the highest level of integration with CE, while the other tools seem to be characterized by a “stand-alone” approach. However, the in-depth analysis of the results highlighted that there is still room for improvement of scholars’ contribution on the integration between SCP tools and CE. We identified three main areas for future research agenda in order to spur further academic and technical debate.

This paper investigates travel demand on Express Lanes during two time periods: before the pandemic (from January 2020 to mid-March 2020) and during the pandemic (from mid-March 2020 to the end of May 2020). A large data set of trips observed on Express Lanes derived from transponders is combined with vehicle probe measures of travel times and used to estimate the willingness to pay to travel on Express Lanes. The analysis reveals that not all Express Lane assets are equal, with the longer Express Lane demonstrating better performance than the shorter one. Peak hours experienced a more significant impact than off-peak hours, reflecting the heightened flexibility in travelers' schedules during the pandemic. The proposed econometric model quantifies the increase in willingness to pay for Express Lanes, which went up to $36 and $34 per hour on the two assets from the values of $26 and $28 per hour estimated before the pandemic, which can be justified by the observed lower market shares during the pandemic.",10.1016/j.tra.2024.104037,"Lin, Shihan; Spissu, Erika; Cirillo, Cinzia"

However, the implementation of CE requires identifying its drivers and barriers. These drivers and barriers further require identification of the pathways to execute the implementation plan. To address this gap, this study explores the drivers and barriers of CE implementation to evaluate their cause and effect relationships and implementation pathways in the context of the Pakistani manufacturing industry – an emerging economy. The results show that resource efficiency sits at the top of the list of internal drivers. Among the external drivers, support from parent company, social responsibility, and international competition and push appear as equally important drivers of CE. The results on the external barriers show a significant role of all three barriers: lack of government policies, lack of industrial support, and lack of supply chain integration and effects of supply chain complexity. Reduction of cost exhibits its multi-faceted effect on profitability/market share and customer-supplier relationship, and lack of expertise affects profit and market demand level.

Can public procurement be strategic? A future agenda proposition,2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Purpose This paper aims to demonstrate how public procurement can be strategic. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following the protocol from Pagani, Kovaleski and Resende (2015), called Methodi Ordinatio, to select the relevant literature on this topic. The analysis of papers selected was carried out following the procedures of categorical content analysis (Bardin, 1977). Findings In all, 68 full papers were analyzed from Science Direct and Web of Science. The results present the main characteristics of publications analyzed and the authors propose some categories of strategic practices related to public procurement that are in turn related to: sustainability, partnerships and supplier management, information systems and technology and other issues. Research limitations/implications The main limitations of this paper are: the publication period considered of the articles selected is from January 2012 to March 2017; the databases Science Direct and Web of Science are selected as the sources of articles; the Methodi Ordinatio is used as the basic protocol of the SLR and, consequently, the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the steps of the protocol are used. Practical implications Showing how the public procurement can be strategic, this paper highlights the benefits of best procurement practices; similarly, it highlights those practices adopted by the private sector, which can highly contribute to the creation of value in public services that are aligned with the concept of obtaining “the best value for money”. Social implications The incorporation of strategic practices in public procurement can result in the best expenditure of public resources and the reduction of corruption in the process of procurement. Originality/value This paper contributes to synthesize the knowledge on strategic procurement, a topic exploited by few people in the public organizations.

Design/methodology/approach In total, 52 papers were deemed to be relevant to the analysis. These works were critiqued using a framework that addressed geographical contexts, topics, methodologies and theoretical frameworks. Findings This review highlights the uneven level of development of the academic debate between North America, the UK and continental Europe, and identifies the different theoretical frameworks that construe the body of literature in each region. In addition, the findings show the scant offer of work on the impact that the digital economy has on FE, as well as the reduced number of studies which have focused on certain vulnerable groups and the access to some financial services. Social implications The studies reviewed have not analyzed the specific needs of vulnerable groups while considering the different contexts and pathways to exclusion.

Originality/value The paper synthesizes the main contributions of the top literature on the redefinition of FI/FE in developed countries, the role of fringe services and new determinants of exclusion. The proliferation of studies regarding FI in low- and middle-income countries has generated a great amount of meta-analysis and systematized reviews of asymmetric results. However, no systematized literature review on the broad scope of FI/FE in developed countries has been published in the last decade. This work sheds light over poorly analyzed areas of research that refer to notable social problems.",10.1108/IJBM-06-2019-0203,"Fernández-Olit, Beatriz; Martín Martín, José María; Porras González, Eva"
The typology of 60R circular economy principles and strategic orientation of their application in business,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8520959924901212,"The circular economy is one of the recent concepts promoted as the pathway for further green and sustainable development, yet entrepreneurs and managers lack the knowledge on implementing circular economy principles. Assuming the multi-dimensional and systemic character of the circular economy, this article provides a road map of 60R circular economy principles that can be adopted in any company to create a positive economic, environmental, and social impact. This set of circular economy principles allows the existing performance of companies within environmental regeneration to be assessed, and identifies possible improvements to business circularity. Identifying additional “R"" principles could lead to increased synergy or complementarity between them. These 60R circular economy principles are classified in four groups - reduce, reuse, recycle and reverse logistics. The proposed list of CE principles provides a useful framework for business managers to structure potential tasks and develop strategies for CE implementation and serve as a roadmap for researchers to extend existing research on CE principles. This study is based on the systematic literature review critically examining 148 articles and providing a comprehensive and profound overview of circular economy principles to be considered by business practitioners and entrepreneurs. Previously, CE principles are researched in environmental sciences, engineering, and energy. This article contributes to the existing knowledge gap and builds new knowledge on the discipline of business management, as publications in these fields are scarce. The study highlights the significance of reverse logistics and calls for extensive research on how companies can incorporate material or product returns into their business models or strategies, which is a critical research question for future studies.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137189,"Uvarova, Inga; Atstaja, Dzintra; Volkova, Tatjana; Grasis, Janis; Ozolina-Ozola, Iveta"

Managing the fatigue frontier: AI applications in air traffic control operations,2025,-1,Outliers,0.22086917156532374,"Fatigue remains a critical contributor to human error in Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems, posing significant risks to aviation safety. The mentally demanding nature of ATC tasks, particularly during transitions from automated to manual control, intensifies the challenges associated with fatigue. While existing fatigue detection methods are broadly categorized into behavioral, physiological, and subjective approaches, there is limited understanding on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being utilized in this context. To address this gap, this study presents a systematic literature review of 105 peer-reviewed studies, focusing on both technological and human-centric dimensions of fatigue management in ATC. The review explores key advancements in fatigue detection strategies, including the development of reliable data collection platforms, refined feature classification techniques, and the use of simulation-based assessments. It further highlights the potential of AI to enhance traditional human factors frameworks by enabling a more integrated approach that balances human adaptability with automated support.

Identifying and evaluating R&D partners via patent-based multilayer networks from the perspective of knowledge complementarity: A case study of unmanned ship technology,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.26970127657373055,"With the rapid pace of technological development, innovation is crucially related to cross-disciplinary collaboration and resource sharing. To address this challenge, researchers need to break existing knowledge boundaries by seeking potential collaborations. However, when identifying and evaluating partners, existing studies have failed to explore patent technology information, patent citation information, and the complex collaborative relationships among patent holders. This results in an incomplete and inaccurate identification and evaluation of potential R&D partners. In response, this study proposes a multilayer network framework based on patent data to identify and evaluate potential R&D partners. This framework considers patent technical information, citation information, and collaboration among patentees. The method consists of three key stages. First, a network of collaboration between patentees, a knowledge network, and a patent citation network are constructed. Second, complementarity metrics are proposed on the basis of the combination of similarity and heterogeneity to identify potential R&D partners. Finally, potential R&D partners are further evaluated and determined by analyzing competitive or collaborative relationships. The proposed method is verified through a case study of unmanned ship technology. This method provides a more comprehensive perspective for R&D partner identification and evaluation. Moreover, the results provide a reference for enterprises to improve their collaboration efficiency.",10.1016/j.cie.2025.111085,"Wang, Jinfeng; Wang, Ningtao; Zhao, Weiyu; Feng, Lijie"

Information sharing in supply chains: a review of risks and opportunities using the systematic literature network analysis (SLNA),2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8782039238915356,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the most important research areas on information sharing in supply chains and related risks, taking into account their evolution over time. This paper sheds light on what is happening today and what the trajectories for the future are, with particular respect to the implications for supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach The dynamic literature review method called Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA) was adopted. It combines the Systematic Literature Review approach and bibliographic network analyses, and it relies on objective measures and algorithms to perform quantitative literature-based detection of emerging topics. Findings The focus of the literature seems to be on threats that are internal to the extended supply chain rather than on external attacks, such as viruses, traditionally related to information technology (IT). The main arising risk appears to be the intentional or non-intentional leakage of information. Also, papers analyze the implications for information sharing coming from “soft” factors such as trust and collaboration among supply chain partners. Opportunities are also highlighted and include how information sharing can be leveraged to confront disruptions and increase resilience. Research limitations/implications The adopted methodology allows for providing an original perspective on the investigated topic, that is, how information sharing in supply chains and related risks are evolving over time because of the turbulent advances in technology. Practical implications Emergent and highly critical risks related to information sharing are highlighted to support the design of supply chain risks strategies. Also, critical areas to the development of “beyond-the-dyad” initiatives to manage information sharing risks emerge. Opportunities coming from information sharing that are less known and exploited by companies are provided. Originality/value This paper focuses on the supply chain perspective rather than the traditional IT-based view of information sharing. According to this perspective, this paper provides a dynamic representation of the literature on the investigated topic.

Transforming mindsets toward open industry platforms: The role of AI in business model innovation,2025,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.22476908393191855,"Many traditional business-to-business (B2B) firms across industries have introduced digital platforms to enhance joint value creation and productivity, using artificial intelligence (AI) for platform development. Platform owners play a critical role in such platforms’ governance and in designing platform-based business models (BMs) to foster value creation within platform ecosystems. Given the complex architecture of B2B platforms, platform owners must continuously renew their capabilities and shift their mindset throughout the platform lifecycle to innovate new platform-based BMs, and they increasingly use AI tools for this purpose. However, little research on business model innovation (BMI) has focused on how managers can shift their mindsets to support the evolution of digital platforms or how AI can support these shifts. Therefore, this study investigates how AI is advancing BMI in the platform context and what mindset shifts must occur in managers. We focused on nine traditional firms that are B2B platform owners and interviewed 15 managers. Our findings show that AI plays three distinct roles in the evolution of a digital platform’s BMI: AI as Optimizer, as Expander, and as Creator. Our findings emphasize that AI-powered BMI in platform ecosystems is not solely technology driven but also requires significant shifts in managers’ mindsets. We also provide practical insights, demonstrating how AI’s capacity to process vast amounts of data can empower platform owners to develop more sophisticated BMI. Furthermore, we encourage managers in traditional firms to reflect on their own mindsets during digital platform evolution.",10.1016/j.jengtecman.2025.101914,"Hautamäki, Pia; Heikinheimo, Minna"
Circular Cities: Mapping Six Cities in Transition,2018,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.3669165575678391,"Urbanisation and climate change are urging cities to chart novel paths towards sustainable futures.

We found that political leadership, building adaptable future visions, using experimental approaches (such as living labs), developing contextual knowledge about resource use, and engaging with diverse stakeholders to be important. However, we also expose that there is a lack of consensus on what a circular city constitutes and a need to further untangle the how and why of the circular city concept.

A fair trial in complex technology cases: Why courts and judges need a basic understanding of complex technologies,2024,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.25575478951241576,"Technology is getting increasingly complicated. If complex technologies have the potential to cause harm, people may need protection. Such legal protection is increasingly available, but it is only effective if it can also be enforced in courts. If people do not understand what is happening, for instance, with their personal data, they may not go to court at all. When people go to court, they may encounter another problem: if also courts and judges have a limited understanding of how the complex technologies work, this can affect the right to a fair trial. In this paper, it is argued that a fair trial requires that courts and judges need to have sufficient understanding of the technology in cases on which they are ruling.

Rethinking tourism-driven urban transformation and social tourism impact: A scenario from a CEE city,2023,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"Even though research on tourism-oriented urban change is growing in number, little attention is paid to urban policy drivers of this transformation, especially in the context of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). There is also a lack of knowledge about how such changes are perceived by long-term residents who live in ‘tourist neighborhoods’. For tourism-oriented urban change, urban regeneration and urban entrepreneurial policies have been of key importance. Furthermore, in CEE cities, tourism-driven urban change was strongly influenced by the character of the transformation of this region after the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. In-depth interviews with long-term residents of the ‘tourist neighborhood’ (historic city center) of Kraków (Poland) have allowed to distinguish various types of tourism-related displacement in the context of a CEE tourism city. Their connections to depopulation, social changes to the neighborhood and tourism-driven financialization of historical housing have been subject to investigation.

Estimating Industry 4.0 impact on job profiles and skills using text mining,2020,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.14036251738389138,"Industry 4.0 is introducing rapid and epochal changes and challenges. Among these, the issue of skills and job profiles is assuming a critical role. In fact, the literature highlights not only the necessary integration of existing skills in professional profiles, but also the inevitable creation of new ones to properly manage the digitalisation trends. Although, the state of the art mostly focuses on building models to assess the digital maturity of companies, considering instead the impact on the labor market as a hazy issue. Moreover, the literature tends to offer qualitative approaches to the topic, making the results uncertain; on the other side, quantitative ones tend to be mainly applied on structured databases, while the supply and demand of competences (findable in CVs, vacancies or firm’s job profiles) are less treated. The goal of the present research is developing a measure for quantifying the readiness of employees belonging to a big firm with respect to the Industry 4.0 paradigm. To reach the goal, a data-driven approach based on text mining techniques is applied to a case study. In particular the present methodology makes use of a previously developed enriched dictionary of technologies and methods 4.0 (Chiarello et al., 2018). The source is used to analyze job profiles’ descriptions belonging to Whirlpool, a multinational company with a structured database of jobs and skills. The process allows the identification of technologies, techniques and related skills contained in job descriptions. Starting from these, the Industry 4.0 impact on each job profile is measured. Finally, the metadata of the job profiles are analyzed to evaluate to which extent the skills of profiles 4.0-ready and non-4.0-ready differ.

Leveraging graph theory approach for managing design principles for sustainable manufacturing of industry 4.0: A case study of electrical equipment manufacturing industry,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Abstract Analyzing design principles and supply chain sustainability are critical for organizational success in today's competitive marketplace. The process of evaluating an organization's supply chain design principles and manufacturing sustainability entails incorporating various sources of information, which are typically uncertain, incomplete, and subjective in nature. Particularly when various organizations are confronted with significant principles such as a lack of interoperability, decentralization, virtualization, real-time and capabilities, service orientation, and so on. Using graph theory and a matrix approach (GTMA), this article attempts to analyze the interaction between design principles-related factors with a focus on operational excellence, growth and sustainability in supply chains by considering the business of Industry 4.0. We have considered electrical equipment manufacturing Industry 4.0 as test ground. Based on a literature review and expert opinions, we identified several key principles, and then explored the most significant one using graph theory and a matrix approach. The findings indicate that autonomy has been evaluated as the most significant challenge to manage design principles most effectively for sustainable manufacturing in the Industry 4.0 context. Therefore, organizations must enhance autonomous systems capable of operating and making decisions alone, without relying on external instructions or support, in order to achieve sustainability. This and the other identified principles to achieving corporate supply chain sustainability are ranked in this paper. These findings will be useful for managers and policymakers managing the interaction between people and processes, as well as corporate sustainability management in Industry 4.0-based supply chain organizations. The unique contributions of this paper can aid in the improvement of design principles and the sustainability of emerging economies' Industry 4.0 perspectives.",10.1016/j.smse.2024.100027,"Shupti, Mehayrun Nesa; Hossain, Niamat Ullah Ibne; Fazio, Steven A; Ashik, Jahid Hasan"

Data, people and technologies in participatory governance",2015,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"The aim of this paper is to prefigure the future of urban sustainability governance by implementing crowdsourcing-based solutions for governance processes. We explore the convergence between recent research in urban sustainability governance and crowdsourcing. This is done by reviewing the literature in order to acquire important evidence to support the inductive process of theory building, and to highlight the upcoming trends in participatory research and policy-making that exploit ICT and Web 2.0 social software. Our analysis indicates that a transformative relationship between data and people creates new forms of distant search for solutions and decision making. We argue that interest in crowdsourcing has expanded from computing researches to social and environmental applications. This new practical dimension unlocks the futures of integration of crowdsourcing into best practices in the governance of sustainability in an urban context. Building on evidence that implementing crowdsourcing into the forthcoming governance of urban sustainability is increasingly recognised as a common priority, the paper suggests policy makers to devote more resources to ensure openness, transparency, interoperability and adaptability of crowdsourcing platforms.",10.1016/j.futures.2014.11.006,"Certomà, Chiara; Corsini, Filippo; Rizzi, Francesco"

Data mining techniques for predicting teacher evaluation in higher education: A systematic literature review,2023,-1,Outliers,0.08291298447222689,"Teacher evaluation is presented as an object of study of great interest, where multiple efforts converge to establish models from the association of heterogeneous data from academic actors, one of these is the students' community, who stands out for their contribution with rich data information for the establishment of teacher evaluation in higher education. This study aims to present the search results for references on the prediction of teacher evaluation based on the associated data provided by the performance of university students. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was carried out, established by the phases of planning (search objective, research questions, inclusion and exclusion criteria), search and selection (literature control group and keywords, the definition of the search string, results filtering), and extraction (synthesis of the contributions). As a result, a set of references on the application of predictions is obtained, focused on educational data mining techniques, such as Fuzzy logic, Fuzzy clustering, Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN), Neural networks, multilayer perceptron (MLP), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), and Associative classification model.

Understanding digital capabilities and their impacts on Australian agri-food supply chain resilience: Engineering vs. socio-ecological thinking,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Many agri-food supply chains (SCs) are vulnerable to sudden disruptions (i.e., shocks), which can have devastating impacts. SC member firms’ digital capabilities (as routinized and integrated resource bundles) have the potential to address these challenges, yet their nature and differentiated impacts on engineering versus socio-ecological resilience are not well understood in the present literature. The purpose of this study is to address these gaps. First, a comprehensive taxonomy of five digital capabilities (labelled LogisticsTech, SecureData, ClientValue, InsightDecision, and InnovateTech) is developed, along with a set of nine resilience criteria/sub-criteria useful for resiliency evaluation. This was achieved through using a narrative literature review, a content analysis, validated by a Delphi study, and semi-structured interviews. Second, the relative impacts of these capabilities on resilience are assessed through pairwise comparison, network analysis, and system dynamics modelling across six Australian agri-food SCs (Grains, Red Meat, Dairy, Horticulture, Seafood, and Wine). The study findings reveal that Australian agri-food SC members’ digital capabilities play distinct but interconnected roles in enhancing resilience, with their impact varying across persistence (engineering), adaptation, and transformation (socio-ecological) over different time frames. LogisticsTech is crucial for short-term, while SecureData safeguards long-term persistence. Moreover, InsightDecision supports immediate adaptation, ClientValue facilitates long-term adaptation, and InnovateTech drives systemic transformation and future-ready SCs. The study offers strategic insights for managers and policymakers to align digital technology adoption with resilience objectives.",10.1016/j.techfore.2025.124191,"Taghikhah, Firouzeh Rosa; Prior, Daniel D; Hafezi, Reza; Baker, Derek; Matous, Petr"
"Community recommendations for geochemical data, services and analytical capabilities in the 21st century",2023,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.18647951121019132,"The majority of geochemical and cosmochemical research is based upon observations and, in particular, upon the acquisition, processing and interpretation of analytical data from physical samples. The exponential increase in volumes and rates of data acquisition over the last century, combined with advances in instruments, analytical methods and an increasing variety of data types analysed, has necessitated the development of new ways of data curation, access and sharing. Together with novel data processing methods, these changes have enabled new scientific insights and are driving innovation in Earth and Planetary Science research. Yet, as approaches to data-intensive research develop and evolve, new challenges emerge. As large and often global data compilations increasingly form the basis for new research studies, institutional and methodological differences in data reporting are proving to be significant hurdles in synthesising data from multiple sources. Consistent data formats and data acquisition descriptions are becoming crucial to enable quality assessment, reusability and integration of results fostering confidence in available data for reuse. Here, we explore the key challenges faced by the geo- and cosmochemistry community and, by drawing comparisons from other communities, recommend possible approaches to overcome them. The first challenge is bringing together the numerous sub-disciplines within our community under a common international initiative. One key factor for this convergence is gaining endorsement from the international geochemical, cosmochemical and analytical societies and associations, journals and institutions. Increased education and outreach, spearheaded by ambassadors recruited from leading scientists across disciplines, will further contribute to raising awareness, and to uniting and mobilising the community. Appropriate incentives, recognition and credit for good data management as well as an improved, user-oriented technical infrastructure will be essential for achieving a cultural change towards an environment in which the effective use and real-time interchange of large datasets is common-place. Finally, the development of best practices for standardised data reporting and exchange, driven by expert committees, will be a crucial step towards making geo- and cosmochemical data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by both humans and machines (FAIR).",10.1016/j.gca.2023.04.024,"Klöcking, Marthe; Wyborn, Lesley; Lehnert, Kerstin A.; Ware, Bryant; Prent, Alexander M.; Profeta, Lucia; Kohlmann, Fabian; Noble, Wayne; Bruno, Ian; Lambart, Sarah; Ananuer, Halimulati; Barber, Nicholas D.; Becker, Harry; Brodbeck, Maurice; Deng, Hang; Deng, Kai; Elger, Kirsten; de Souza Franco, Gabriel; Gao, Yajie; Ghasera, Khalid Mohammed; Hezel, Dominik C.; Huang, Jingyi; Kerswell, Buchanan; Koch, Hilde; Lanati, Anthony W.; ter Maat, Geertje; Martínez-Villegas, Nadia; Nana Yobo, Lucien; Redaa, Ahmad; Schäfer, Wiebke; Swing, Megan R.; Taylor, Richard J.M.; Traun, Marie Katrine; Whelan, Jo; Zhou, Tengfei"
Business model innovation as a mediator between construction 4.0 and firm performance: Evidence from Turkish construction companies,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.868321890715618,"The construction industry has a crucial place in any country's economy. However, compared to other sectors, construction companies have been relatively slow to adopt new technologies, while most companies in different sectors have already begun to adopt the latest technologies to renovate their way of doing business and improve their overall performance. Therefore, Construction 4.0, as the digital transformation of construction companies in the era of Industry 4.0, attracts the attention of both practitioners and researchers. This empirical study aims to uncover the complex relations among Construction 4.0, Business Model Innovation (BMI), and firm performance in a developing country context. We propose an original model of relations purporting that BMI mediates the positive effects of Construction 4.0 on firm performance, drawing mainly on the dynamic capabilities view. All statistical analyses were performed by using R statistical language. Data was gathered from 152 managers in the Turkish construction sector via the convenience sampling method. Descriptive statistics, validity, reliability, correlation, and PROCESS mediation analyses were used to test research hypotheses. The results show that both digital and physical layers of Construction 4.0 positively relate to firm performance and that BMI fully mediates this positive relation.

Pharma Industry 4.0: Literature review and research opportunities in sustainable pharmaceutical supply chains,2018,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.4009778966866299,"The exploitation of the emerging technologies of Pharma Industry 4.0 facilitates sustainable value creation, leads to more agile, smart and personalised pharma industry, and thereby, in the long-run, enables pharma companies to obtain competitive advantages. A more sustainable pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) should be implemented to match future operations and management of the pharmaceutical products across the entire life cycle. The main purpose of this study is to identify the potential sustainability barriers of PSC and to investigate how Industry 4.0 can be applied in the sustainable PSC paradigms. This paper systematically reviews 33 relevant articles concerning sustainable PSC and Industry 4.0, taken from peer-reviewed academic journals over a decade (2008–2018). Based on content analysis, we find that the major challenges that inhibit inclusion of sustainability in the PSCs are: high costs and time consumption, little expertise and training, enforcement of regulations, the paucity of business incentives, ineffective collaborations and coordination across the PSC, lack of objective benchmarks, and poor end-customer awareness. The technologies and innovations based on Industry 4.0 can solve these barriers with regards to four aspects: enhancing the flexibility of the PSC for patient-centric drug supplies; improving the effectiveness of coordination and communication across different entities within the PSC; mitigating waste and pollution at different stages; and enabling a more autonomous decision-making process for supply chain managers. Our analysis reveals that future research interest should focus on: cross-linking coordination and cooperation, eco-friendly end-of-life products disposal, proactive product recall management, new benchmarks and measurement of sustainable performance, new regulation system design, and effects of incentives for sustainable activities.",10.1016/j.psep.2018.06.031,"Ding, Baoyang"

Radiation Therapy and Indigenous Peoples in Canada and Australia: Building Paths Toward Reconciliation in Cancer Care Delivery,2023,-1,Outliers,0.07932477927901253,"Abstract Indigenous peoples represent approximately 5% of the world's population and reside in over 90 countries worldwide. They embody a rich diversity of cultures, traditions, languages and relationships with the land that are shared through many generations and that are distinct from those of the settler societies within which they now live. Many Indigenous peoples have a shared experience of discrimination, trauma, and violation of rights, rooted in complex sociopolitical relationships with settler societies that are still ongoing. This results in continuing social injustices and pronounced disparities in health for many Indigenous peoples around the globe. Indigenous peoples exhibit a significantly higher cancer incidence, mortality, and poorer survival compared to non-Indigenous peoples. Cancer services, including radiotherapy, have not been designed to support the specific values and needs of Indigenous populations, resulting in poorer access to cancer services for Indigenous peoples globally across the entire cancer care spectrum. Specific to radiotherapy, available evidence demonstrates disparities in radiotherapy uptake between Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients. Radiotherapy centres are also located disparately further away from Indigenous communities. Studies are limited by a lack of Indigenous-specific data to help inform effective radiotherapy delivery. Recent Indigenous-led partnerships and initiatives have helped to address existing gaps in cancer care, and radiation oncologists play an important role in supporting such efforts. In this article, we present an overview of access to radiotherapy for Indigenous peoples in Canada and Australia, with a focus on strengthening cancer care delivery through education, partnerships, and research.",10.1016/j.ijrobp.2022.09.085,"Chan, Jessica; Griffiths, Kalinda; Turner, Ashley; Tobias, Joshua; Clarmont, Warren; Delaney, Geoff; Hutton, Jonathon; Olson, Robert; Penniment, Michael; Bourque, Jean-Marc; Brundage, Michael; Rodin, Danielle; Slotman, Ben; Yap, Mei Ling"
Blockchain-based applications in shipping and port management: a literature review towards defining key conceptual frameworks,2020,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine and to categorize the tendencies of blockchain-based applications in the shipping industry and supply chain as well as the interrelations between them, including possible correlation of found categories with theoretical background and existing concepts. This study also explores whether blockchain can be adopted into existing maritime shipping and port document workflow management. Design/methodology/approach The current study builds a conceptual framework through a systematic project review carried along with scientific and grey literature, published in journals and conference proceedings during the past decade and giving information or proposals on an issue. Findings The results showed that reviewed projects can be compiled into three main conceptual areas: document workflow management, financial processes and device connectivity. However, having clear interlinkages, none of the reviewed projects consider all three areas at once. Concepts associated with maritime document workflow received broad support among the reviewed projects. In addition, reviewed projects unintentionally follow the similar goals that were laid down within port management scientific projects before the introduction of blockchain technology. Originality/value This study contributes to research by revealing a consistent framework for understanding the blockchain applications within maritime port environment, a less-studied part of blockchain implementation in the supply chain field.

Current Challenges of Digital Health Interventions in Pakistan: Mixed Methods Analysis,2020,-1,Outliers,0.17323286837530183,"Background Digital health is well-positioned in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) to revolutionize health care due, in part, to increasing mobile phone access and internet connectivity. This paper evaluates the underlying factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. Objective The objective of this study is to identify the current digital health projects and studies being carried out in Pakistan, as well as the key stakeholders involved in these initiatives. We aim to follow a mixed-methods strategy and to evaluate these projects and studies through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify the internal and external factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. Methods This study aims to evaluate digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan with mixed methods. The qualitative and quantitative data obtained from field surveys were categorized according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommended building blocks for health systems research, and the data were analyzed using a SWOT analysis strategy. Results Of the digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan, 51 are studied. Of these projects, 46% (23/51) used technology for conducting research, 30% (15/51) used technology for implementation, and 12% (6/51) used technology for app development. The health domains targeted were general health (23/51, 46%), immunization (13/51, 26%), and diagnostics (5/51, 10%). Smartphones and devices were used in 55% (28/51) of the interventions, and 59% (30/51) of projects included plans for scaling up. Artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) was used in 31% (16/51) of projects, and 74% (38/51) of interventions were being evaluated. The barriers faced by developers during the implementation phase included the populations’ inability to use the technology or mobile phones in 21% (11/51) of projects, costs in 16% (8/51) of projects, and privacy concerns in 12% (6/51) of projects. Conclusions We conclude that while digital health has a promising future in Pakistan, it is still in its infancy at the time of this study. However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an increase in demand for digital health and implementation of health outcomes following global social distancing protocols, especially in LMICs.

Attaining higher levels of circularity in construction: Scientometric review and cross-industry exploration,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8710835685405456,"Circular economy (CE) is emerging in the construction industry because it attempts to substitute the linear economy model and promote sustainable development. While the CE principles have been applied at different scales, the construction industry's research efforts and practicalities remain limited and fragile. This study aimed at understanding the levels of circularity in the construction industry with a view to formulate viable recommendations required for achieving higher degrees of circularity. This aim is achieved by learning essential lessons from the manufacturing sector, which is considered one of CE's pioneering industries. In this paper, a scientometric review of CE research within the construction and manufacturing sectors was performed. The science mapping method was applied to quantitatively analyse relevant publications retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases. The results suggested that the construction industry centres on recycling and reuse as the main “R” strategies, while the manufacturing industry tends to achieve higher levels of circularity due to broader implementation of remanufacturing and industrial symbiosis (IS). The content analysis of some mainstream articles further identified the potential of adopting remanufacturing and IS in the construction sector. The findings suggested that higher levels of circularity in construction could be attained through the use of remanufactured components and recycled non-construction & demolition waste (CDW). An action plan comprising regulatory pull/push, business-driven, and technological push measures was formulated to guide researchers and practitioners to pursue looking-forward CE strategies.

A framework to explore innovation at SAP through bibliometric analysis of patent applications,2015,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.27220115310453724,"Easily accessible patent databases and advances in technology have enabled the exploration of organizational innovation through the analysis of patent records. However, the textual content of patents presents obstacles to gleaning useful information. In this study, we develop an expert system framework that utilizes text and data mining procedures for analyzing innovation through textual patent data. Specifically, we use patent titles representing the innovation activity at one company (SAP) and perform a bibliometric analysis using our proposed framework. Enterprise software, of which SAP is a pioneering developer, must serve a wide assortment of functions for companies in many different industries. In addition, SAP's sole focus is on enterprise software and it is a market leader in the category with substantial patent activity over the last decade. Using our framework to analyze SAP's patent activity provides a demonstration of how our bibliometric analysis can summarize and identify trends in innovation in a large software company. Our results illustrate that SAP has a breadth of innovative activity spread over the three-tier software engineering architecture and a lack of topical repetition indicative of limited depth. SAP's innovation is also seen to emphasize data management and quickly integrate emerging technologies. Results of an analysis on any company following our framework could be used for a variety of purposes, including: to examine the scope and scale of innovation of an organization, to examine the influence of technological trends on businesses, or to gain insight into corporate strategy that could be used to aid planning, investment, and purchasing decisions.",10.1016/j.eswa.2015.08.007,"James, Tabitha L.; Cook, Deborah F.; Conlon, Sumali; Keeling, Kellie B.; Collignon, Stephane; White, Trevor"
Conceptualizing corruption prevention: a systematic literature review,2019,-1,Outliers,0.1057860404283748,"Purpose Existing reviews about corruption and anti-corruption have yet to treat the subject of prevention as the main focus of inquiry. The purpose of this paper is to address this need by analyzing definitions, theoretical underpinnings, methods and sectors of interest within published academic articles. By doing so, the main objective is to clarify the theoretical and conceptual foundations of the prevention of corruption. Design/methodology/approach The research design consists of a systematic literature review, which uses a keyword-string search method across relevant databases.

A pending task for the digitalisation of agriculture: A general framework for technologies classification in agriculture,2024,0,Topic_0_agriculture_agricultural_food,1.0,"CONTEXT This research paper details the response to a central challenge of the digitalization of agricultural systems which stems from information overload and the broad heterogeneity of agricultural technologies and the classification thereof. It is the result of four years of effort on the Horizon 2020 SmartAgriHubs (SAH) project, whose purpose was the development and connection of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) and Competence Centres (CCs) related to the agricultural sector in Europe. CCs form the backbone of DIHs and provide the digital technological infrastructure by offering advanced technical expertise, access to the latest knowledge and information on digital technologies, and other technological and scientific infrastructure. However, the lack of a general framework for technology classification in agriculture needed to be remedied, not only to specifically advance the general aim of SmartAgriHubs and DIHs to “connect the dots”, but in general, so as to facilitate a broad range of actors involved in digitalisation of agriculture. OBJECTIVE This paper sets out the conceptual framework for the classification of technologies in the agricultural sector, and the development of the “Agricultural Technology Navigator” (ATN) as an iterative tool for gathering and searching for information to support such classification, so that actors involved in the digitalization of agriculture may more easily find and communicate technologies related to digital solutions. METHODS A multi-actor, multi-disciplinary expert group was formed to identify technologies and define keywords. A literature, patent, foresights studies, and grey literature review was also carried out. Text mining techniques, using the JCR “Tool for Innovation Monitoring”, were used based on keywords selected by experts for documents analysis (+170,000,000 publications; + 22,000,000 patent applications; + 77,000 projects). Gaps in previous studies were identified to form the basis upon which to create a new classification system. Taking into account the fact that technologies are continually developing and evolving, an iterative approach was also necessary. To this end, a new tool was developed, compatible with agricultural supply chains, to gather “bottom up” information from CCs (and other actors) on innovative digital technologies and solutions. RESULTS And Conclusions The main results of all the publications, patents and projects summarized herein, provide a scientifically sound foundation for a much-needed classification of digital technologies used in agriculture. This paper analyses different dimensions or categories in which the diverse technologies can be classified and selects the most appropriate classification to describe the technologies which could be used and managed by CCs and other agricultural actors, in offering and searching for systems and competences which provide digital solutions. SIGNIFICANCE Given the importance of DIHs and CCs, and more recently European DIHs (EDIHs), in the European agricultural policy agenda and the development of the sustainable digitalization of agriculture, it is necessary to have a mechanism to appropriately classify digital technologies relevant for agriculture so that providers and users can “match-make” and easily offer, find, and decide on relevant digital tools and solutions. CCs are not the only entities that benefit from such classification. A diverse range of actors involved in the sustainable digitalisation of agriculture, such as technology companies, farm advisors, machinery and other input suppliers who develop and deal in novel and different technology innovations, can benefit from being able to describe appropriately their technologies as part of agricultural systems and solutions.",10.1016/j.agsy.2023.103794,"Moreno, José C.; Berenguel, Manuel; Donaire, Julián G.; Rodríguez, Francisco; Sánchez-Molina, Jorge A.; Guzmán, José Luis; Giagnocavo, Cynthia L."

However, this situation has gradually changed, as carbon footprint quantification in construction waste allows for performance benchmarking with other circular economy initiatives. This study presents the first systematic review of construction waste-related carbon emission accounting methods. By analysing 108 journal articles, the review identified seven types of activities (e.g., generation, transportation, sorting, reusing, recycling, landfilling, and incineration) contributing to carbon emissions across the construction waste lifecycle. They encompass four types of emission-producing unit processes: mechanical operation, manual operation, chemical reaction, and material replacement. Each has a distinct emission accounting formula, but follows a generalized principle “Emission per unit × Unit”. Also, existing studies exhibit five evolution trends in this research field: shifting from single-stage accounting to lifecycle assessment; from simple calculation to complex conversion; from project-scale to urban-scale emission investigation and management; from accounting exercises to policy implication; and from carbon accounting to mitigation strategies. Moreover, the review sheds light on three future research directions: the need for generalisable lifecycle emission quantification frameworks, comparisons of the carbon reduction potential among various waste disposal technologies, and consideration of cost analysis into carbon emission quantification. This study contributes to the development of sustainable construction waste management strategies aligned with the goals of the circular economy and carbon neutrality.",10.1016/j.eiar.2024.107551,"Yuan, Liang; Yang, Bing; Lu, Weisheng; Peng, Ziyu"
What can we learn from marketers? A bibliometric analysis of the marketing literature on business model research,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.33153165540724683,"Strategic management has extensively contributed to the development of business model research. Although marketing concepts (e.g., customers, value creation, delivery, and exchange) form an essential part of any business model description, from an academic standpoint, the strategy literature has been slow to incorporate contributions from the marketing literature on business model research. Drawing on mixed bibliometric techniques combining co-citation analysis (CCA) and bibliographic coupling analysis (BCA), we seek to fill this gap by exploring the origins and trends of business model research in marketing journals (285 articles published in 38 marketing journals). The CCA reveals three theoretical pillars labelled ‘business model rationale in marketing’, ‘business model conceptual origins’, and ‘business model literature developments’ that provide a consistent base for cross-fertilization. The BCA uncovers eight conversations organized into two research streams, namely ‘holistic perspective’ and ‘downstream perspective’. Considering these results, we discuss the partial appropriation of marketing issues by strategists and propose a three-pronged research agenda based on consumer data as a major source of competitive advantage.",10.1016/j.lrp.2022.102219,"Maucuer, Raphaël; Renaud, Alexandre; Ronteau, Sébastien; Muzellec, Laurent"
Accessible charts are part of the equation of accessible papers: a heuristic evaluation of the highest impact LIS journals,2021,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.19707691108355144,"Purpose Statistical charts are an essential source of information in academic papers. Charts have an important role in conveying, clarifying and simplifying the research results provided by the authors, but they present some accessibility barriers for people with low vision. This article aims to evaluate the accessibility of the statistical charts published in the library and information science (LIS) journals with the greatest impact factor. Design/methodology/approach A list of heuristic indicators developed by the authors has been used to assess the accessibility of statistical charts for people with low vision. The heuristics have been applied to a sample of charts from 2019 issues of ten LIS journals with the highest impact factor according to the ranking of the JCR. Findings The current practices of image submission do not follow the basic recommended guidelines on accessibility like color contrast or the use of textual alternatives. On the other hand, some incongruities between the technical suggestions of image submission and their application in analyzed charts also emerged. The main problems identified are: poor text alternatives, insufficient contrast ratio between adjacent colors and the inexistence of customization options. Authoring tools do not help authors to fulfill these requirements. Research limitations/implications The sample is not very extensive; nonetheless, it is representative of common practices and the most frequent accessibility problems in this context. Social implications The heuristics proposed are a good starting point to generate guidelines for authors when preparing their papers for publication and to guide journal publishers in creating accessible documents. Low-vision users, a highly prevalent condition, will benefit from the improvements. Originality/value The results of this research provide key insights into low-vision accessibility barriers, not considered in previous literature and can be a starting point for their solution.",10.1108/LHT-08-2020-0188,"Alcaraz Martínez, Rubén; Ribera, Mireia; Roig Marcelino, Jordi; Pascual Almenara, Afra; Granollers Saltiveri, Toni"
Automated Evaluation Tools for Web and Mobile Accessibility: proposal of a new adaptive interface tool,2022,-1,Outliers,0.27454280718625795,"This work focuses on the issues encountered when using current evaluation tools to assess the accessibility and usability of web and mobile applications. Therefore, we present a case study, where we tested three accessibility assessment tools against the official website of Portuguese Institute for Employment and Vocational (IEFP), used by millions of users nationwide. Indeed, we found that individual tools still provide limited coverage of success criteria and, thus, user verification is consistently needed. In this regard, we also aim at proposing a new tool called IncWeb, that can automatically alter any web or mobile application into a usable and fully accessible one, in a way that is transparent to the user and adapted to his type of disability. As such, this work emphasizes the importance of having appropriate tools to facilitate the lives of people with disabilities and/or special needs, presenting not only the problems of other assessment tools, but also proposing a new paradigm-changing solution to overcome those known challenges.",10.1016/j.procs.2022.08.036,"Dias, João; Carvalho, Diana; Rocha, Tânia; Barroso, João"
"A network embedding-based scholar assessment indicator considering four facets: Research topic, author credit allocation, field-normalized journal impact, and published time",2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.15787760373530607,"Scholar performance assessment plays an important role in reward evaluation, funding allocation, and promotion and recruitment decisions. However, raw publication counts and raw citation count-based scholar performance assessment indicators, such as H-index or author citations, have shortcomings; for example, they ignore the impact of different citation patterns under different research topics, leading to authorship credit inflation due to full citation allocation to each author in multi-author publications. This study proposes a new scholar performance assessment indicator called the normalized scholar academic productivity (NSAP) indicator, which overcomes the issues posed by raw citation counts and publication counts-related scholar performance indicators by considering diverse aspects of scholar research achievements. The NSAP indicator considers the research topic, author sequence and author role in the author list, field-normalized journal impact when allocating citation counts to scholars, and published time. The research topic is generated by the co-keyword embedding and semantic relatedness of each keyword in order to make NSAP topic-dependent; the author sequence and role affect authorship credit allocation strategy; and field-normalized journal impact was used to assign different weights on raw publication counts and citation counts. Finally, awardees of the Derek de Solla Price Memorial Medal and the Association for Information Science and Technology's awards were used to evaluate the validity of NSAP for calculating scholar performance assessment. Results reveal outstanding topic-related scholar performance assessment properties compared to raw citation count indicators, such as H-index, author citations, and cited-by counts (i.e., total number of citing authors).",10.1016/j.joi.2021.101201,"Xie, Qing; Zhang, Xinyuan; Song, Min"
Can information improve rural governance and service delivery?,2020,-1,Outliers,0.0791776536009348,"In the context of an exponential rise in access to information in the last two decades, this special issue explores when and how information might be harnessed to improve governance and public service delivery in rural areas. Information is a critical component of government and citizens’ decision-making; therefore, improvements in its availability and reliability stand to benefit many dimensions of governance, including service delivery. Service delivery is especially difficult in rural areas which contain the majority of the world’s poor but face unique logistical challenges due to their remoteness. We review the features of the recent information revolution, including increased access to information due to both technological and institutional innovations. We then raise the question of why information often fails to support the goals of improved governance and service delivery. We argue that information alone is insufficient. To be impactful, the information must be deemed relevant, in the sense of being salient and having a high perceived signal-to-noise ratio, and individuals must have both the power and incentives to act on it. Bringing all three of these factors together in any setting is challenging, particularly for rural areas, where capacity to receive, understand, and act on information is relatively low. Research failing to find significant effects of greater access to information on rural governance and service delivery has largely failed due to one of these three factors not being in place. This interpretation is broadly supported by our review of 48 empirical studies on the impacts of information on governance and service delivery. We conclude by discussing broader lessons for both development research, including randomized control trials, and the development process itself. The goals of interventions to provide information may need to be more modest, and their design may merit more scrutiny.",10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.07.017,"Kosec, Katrina; Wantchekon, Leonard"

Leveraging social media to achieve a community policing agenda,2018,3,Topic_3_social_media_social media,0.45302517550267996,"This research investigates the communication behavior and engagement strategies in the bilateral use of social media between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. It advances existing work by studying municipal level government actors in a new communications environment where social media now play an important part. Grounded in agenda setting theory, our analysis identifies police departments' social media issue priorities, analyzes the responses of their audiences to those communications, and directly compares followers' own conversation priorities with the police agenda. Our data set includes all the content from the Facebook and Twitter accounts of five similarly sized and demographically situated police departments in the U.S., plus all the tweets and posts from the followers or friends responding to those accounts over a 90-day period. We performed both manual coding and machine cluster analysis to elicit major threads of conversation. In addition to the data analytics, we conducted interviews with the five police departments to understand the similarities and differences in agenda priorities resulting from their social media goals and use. The study shows the priorities that comprise the police agenda, identifies both similarities and differences in what their audiences communicate among themselves about most frequently in the public safety domain relative to the police agenda, and finds evidence of positive response from the public to some of the agenda priorities communicated by the police. Our data also reveal that police are using social media interactively, which could, over time, advance community policing goals.

"Assessing the potential for green roof retrofitting: A systematic review of methods, indicators and data sources",2025,-1,Outliers,0.18479636871537017,"Green roofs (GRs) serve as resilient and adaptive nature-based solutions, significantly enhancing ecosystem services when retrofitted onto existing buildings in high-density urban environments. Numerous studies have proposed various methodologies and criteria to assess the green roof retrofitting potential (GRRP). However, a systematic review of assessment methodologies, indicators, and associated data remains lacking, hindering the advancement of evidence-based spatial planning. This study systematically reviews 132 peer-reviewed publications on GRRP to identify prevailing trends, synthesize methodological approaches, highlight existing knowledge gaps, and propose directions for future research. The findings reveal a relatively limited focus on GRRP assessment in tropical and desert climate zones, developing countries, and regions in the southern hemisphere. Future research should prioritize retrofitting building roofs with multifunctional systems to address the complex challenges posed by climate change. Assessment methodologies are categorized into three primary approaches: expert experience, multi-criteria decision analysis, modeling and simulations. The most frequently employed assessment indicators include roof slope, roof area, stormwater retention, building height, temperature regulation, green space, building function, and roof material. The analysis indicates a lack of standardized protocols persists across indicator selection and methodological frameworks, limiting the comparability and transferability of findings. We recommend the development of standardized assessment protocols, climate-based classification systems, and data-driven approaches for indicator selection. Additionally, an integrated framework incorporating standardized assessment criteria is essential to facilitate cross-regional comparisons. This review contributes to the growing body of knowledge and development on GR field and provides guidance for the proposal of general GRRP assessment guidelines to better, support GR spatial planning in high-density built environments.",10.1016/j.scs.2025.106261,"Dong, Jing; Li, Chunli; Guo, Ruonan; Guo, Fei; Zheng, Xing"
The complexity of stakeholder influence on MaaS: A study on multi-stakeholder perspectives in Shenzhen self-driving mini-bus case,2022,-1,Outliers,0.4636381338440928,"Emerging technologies are changing our preferences for transportation solutions, which focus on service efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Mobility as a service (MaaS) is a user-oriented transportation solution that integrates both public and private operators into the same platform. The implementation of MaaS aims to simplify users’ booking procedures and increase the usability of various kinds of transportation resources. However, the integration of a myriad of transportation subsystems raises interpretation challenges from associated multi-stakeholder and subsystems. To overcome these challenges, the authors have involved different stakeholders from related subsystems to reveal concerns. This study aims to analyse a novel public transportation system - the self-driving mini-bus service in Shenzhen. The result shows that system characteristics and stakeholder concerns can be established using an Action, Factor and Goal structure.

Complex patterns of ICTs' effect on sustainable development at the national level: The triple bottom line perspective,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.4743144813516781,"Building upon the complexity theory, we explore the interaction effects of the development of key digital information and communication technologies (ICTs) at the national level on a country's sustainability performance. By the means of the fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis on a sample of 77 countries, we show that 1) a country's ICT profile matters for national sustainability performance, not a single ICT element; 2) national sustainability performance is not (only) about the level of ICT development of a country, but about composition and a quality of its ICT profile; 3) there are multiple distinctive ICT profiles that may lead to high or low sustainability performance (social, economic or environmental) at the national level; and 4) environmental sustainability may have conflicting ICT-related antecedents in comparison to social and economic sustainability. These results offer two primary contributions to research focused on the role of ICTs in supporting (or deterring) sustainable development. First, moving away from simplified perspective of a country's ICT development by focusing on a country's ICT profile allows us to distinguish effects (both positive and negative) of different ICT elements, as well as to take synergies brought by technological convergences into account. This allows us to capture effects of ICT elements in their totality, avoiding to lose richness and comprehensiveness. Second, by focusing on the triple-bottom line sustainability, we add to the growing evidence that environmental-focused goals often conflict with those related to social and economic aspects of sustainable development.",10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122969,"Tekic, Zeljko; Tekic, Anja"
Characteristics and evolution of hierarchical fishery policies in China – A textual analysis based on 5311 policies from 2003 to 2022,2023,-1,Outliers,0.10385299330372816,"Abstracts The innovative, uncertain and external nature of the fishing industry dictates that industrial policy plays an important role in its development. Rapid development through policy support has led to excellent results and leadership, while contributing to China's economic growth. Using text mining techniques, this paper conducts a hierarchical association mining of China's fishery policies based on three dimensions of policy keyword co-occurrence, policy themes and policy tools, and employs visualization methods to better reveal the dynamic evolutionary patterns of policies. Based on 5311 fishery policy texts at the national, provincial and municipal levels from 2003 to 2022 in China, three techniques of co-occurrence analysis, LDA topic modelling and similarity calculation were used to mine the texts respectively, and CiteSpace, LDAvis and ThemeRiver methods were used to visualize and analyze them. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) In terms of co-occurrence of policy keywords, there are patterns of ""progressive evolution"", ""hierarchical lag"" and ""hierarchical lagged evolution"". (2) In terms of policy themes, there is an evolutionary development of industries, enterprises, technologies and products from the macro to the micro level, and the ""hierarchical stage correlation"" feature is more obvious. (3) In terms of policy instruments, there are obvious ""environmental policies are the most numerous, demand-based policies are the second most numerous, and supply-based policies are the least numerous"", ""the hierarchy lags behind development"", ""the role of central policies is strong, but the role of local policies is weak "", and ""emphasis on project construction, but not on public services"". Further, this paper puts forward policy recommendations in terms of shortening the time lag of industrial policies, strengthening policy coordination and improving policy content, aiming to improve the market-oriented mechanism of fishery policies, optimise public services and promote development.",10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105699,"Yu, Wencheng; Yu, Miao; Ding, Lili"
Skills or degree?

In this context, our study aims to understand whether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than formal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have initiated “skill-based hiring” for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018 to 2023, demand for AI roles grew by 21 % as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024). Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles declined by 15 %. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI skills command a wage premium of 23 %, exceeding the value of degrees up until the PhD-level (33 %). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend leveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships, on-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training, micro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and address talent shortages.",10.1016/j.techfore.2025.124042,"Bone, Matthew; González Ehlinger, Eugenia; Stephany, Fabian"
Modern computational approaches for rice yield prediction: A systematic review of statistical and machine learning-based methods,2025,0,Topic_0_agriculture_agricultural_food,0.5100839713502308,"Context: Rice is a critical food source for over half the global population, making yield forecasting important for food security and agricultural planning. Advances in statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, coupled with data sources such as hyperspectral and UAV-derived imagery, have transformed the practice of rice yield forecasting. Objective: This review assesses the effectiveness of such data-driven approaches for rice yield prediction, focusing on model accuracy, scalability, and generalizability, while identifying existing gaps and future directions. Methodology: A systematic review of 156 studies was conducted using PRISMA guidelines, covering machine learning models such as Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The input data comprised satellite-based indices (e.g., NDVI, MODIS), climate variables (precipitation, temperature), and ground observations. Performance metrics, such as R2, MAE, and MAPE, were analyzed to evaluate model performance across various regions and conditions. Results and conclusions: Neural Networks and Random Forest models were the most commonly used, with satellite and climate variables being integral to predictions. Key challenges identified include limited data availability, overfitting, and difficulty in generalizing models across regions and rice cultivars. Several gaps remain in standardizing evaluation metrics, incorporating ground-truth data, and adapting models for real-world agricultural decision-making.

Proposal of an assessment tool to diagnose industrial symbiosis readiness,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7191842208438286,"ABSTRACT This paper aims to present an original assessment tool developed to diagnose industrial symbiosis (IS) readiness. It is expected that industries with greater symbiotic readiness are more likely to have success in implementing a circular business model. A bibliographic analysis was conducted in order to identify the IS variables and dimensions, mentioned in the literature, as necessary for implementation of a circular business model. Two dimensions were defined in this study: (i) exchange resources and (ii) exchange capacity. The exchange resources dimension diagnoses the company's ability to have the necessary exchange resources to IS implementation (water, energy, by-products, and waste). The exchange capacity dimension diagnoses the company's enabler factors to IS implementation (trust, information, access conditions, and infrastructure). After the definition of dimensions and their respective variables, an assessment tool to diagnose industrial symbiosis readiness was developed. The assessment tool is presented as a checklist format - Symbiotic Readiness Checklist (SRC). This was applied to six co-located industries in the State of São Paulo (Brazil). The proposed SRC could be used to: (a) diagnose the readiness of companies or organizations to implement industrial symbiosis; (b) be a tool in enterprise or organizational strategic planning; (c) assist the development of mechanisms to measure the number of resources consumed and waste produced in the supply chain; (d) assess the circularity of resources.",10.1016/j.spc.2022.01.013,"Agudo, Fabiana Liar; Bezerra, Bárbara Stolte; Paes, Luis Alberto Bertolucci; Gobbo Júnior, José Alcides"

Technological progress in electronic health record system optimization: Systematic review of systematic literature reviews,2021,-1,Outliers,0.1308014788059556,"Background The recent, rapid development of digital technologies offers new possibilities for more efficient implementation of electronic health record (EHR) and personal health record (PHR) systems. A growing volume of healthcare data has been the hallmark of this digital transformation. The large healthcare datasets' complexity and their dynamic nature pose various challenges related to processing, analysis, storage, security, privacy, data exchange, and usability. Materials and Methods We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews to assess technological progress in EHR and PHR systems. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for systematic literature reviews on technological advancements that support EHR and PHR systems published between January 1, 2010, and October 06, 2020. Results The searches resulted in a total of 2,448 hits. Of these, we finally selected 23 systematic reviews. Most of the included papers dealt with information extraction tools and natural language processing technology (n = 10), followed by studies that assessed the use of blockchain technology in healthcare (n = 8). Other areas of digital technology research included EHR and PHR systems in austere settings (n = 1), de-identification methods (n = 1), visualization techniques (n = 1), communication tools within EHR and PHR systems (n = 1), and methodologies for defining Clinical Information Models that promoted EHRs and PHRs interoperability (n = 1). Conclusions Technological advancements can improve the efficiency in the implementation of EHR and PHR systems in numerous ways. Natural language processing techniques, either rule-based, machine-learning, or deep learning-based, can extract information from clinical narratives and other unstructured data locked in EHRs and PHRs, allowing secondary research (i.e., phenotyping). Moreover, EHRs and PHRs are expected to be the primary beneficiaries of the blockchain technology implementation on Health Information Systems. Governance regulations, lack of trust, poor scalability, security, privacy, low performance, and high cost remain the most critical challenges for implementing these technologies.",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104507,"Negro-Calduch, Elsa; Azzopardi-Muscat, Natasha; Krishnamurthy, Ramesh S.; Novillo-Ortiz, David"
Comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art contractor selection models in construction environment-A critical review and future call,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"This paper presents the analysis of contractor selection (CS) models from the perspective of critical review. A comprehensive analysis of contemporary CS models is conducted in the context of model criteria, decision-making techniques, and selection mechanisms. The major aim of this analysis is to probe the shortcomings in the precedent selection models and further to overcome the reservations with exhortation. The authors retort the interrogations from the review of articles from the last two decades. The study compiles the major chunk of the model's classifications in the frame of their purposes and the drawbacks of current models to enlighten the work. It is concluded from the analysis, observations, and critical understating of reviewed models that owing to several shortcomings in those models, comprehensive research is required to develop easier and user-friendly models that sound practical on the ground. The future call in terms of appropriateness, suitability and simplicity, and applicability and adaptability terms is a novel and interesting approach for future CS models.",10.1016/j.seps.2021.101137,"Khoso, Ali Raza; Yusof, Aminah Md; Chen, Zhen-Song; Skibniewski, Mirosław J.; Chin, Kwai-Sang; Khahro, Shabir Hussain; Sohu, Samiullah"
"Financing the future: The role of fintech, leadership, and financial competencies in driving sustainable firm performance",2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.46693538257489636,"This study employs the theoretical lenses of Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT) and the Resource-Based View (RBV) perspective to examine how access to finance (AF) and the association of sustainable innovative leadership (SIL) affect sustainable performance within firms. This study explores the mediating role of FinTech adoption (FTA) and the moderated mediation role of financial competencies (FC) in the Pakistani SME sector. Survey data from 350 SME executives were analyzed through Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that AF and SIL are positively related to a firm's sustainable performance through FTA. Furthermore, FC positively moderates the relationship between AF, FTA, and the firm's sustainable performance. Findings show that AF, SIL, FTA, and FC are fundamental resources that are associated with sustainable performance in all three domains: Environmental (ESP), social (SSP), and financial (FSP) performance. These findings aim to equip SME management and policymakers with a robust practical framework for the execution of FinTech and improvement in internal and external controls, as well as managerial financial competencies. This will improve firms' access to finance and inform capacity-building programs, enabling policymakers to craft targeted FinTech regulatory frameworks.",10.1016/j.actpsy.2025.105449,"Bajwa, Farooq Ahmad; Fu, Jingtao; Bajwa, Ishtiaq Ahmad; Alsuhaibany, Yazeed M."
Knowledge management in entrepreneurial universities,2019,-1,Outliers,0.13080610162915962,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review and critique the knowledge management (KM) literature within Entrepreneurial universities, providing an overview of the state of research and outlining a future research agenda. Design/methodology/approach In a systematic literature review, 1106 articles indexed at Scopus were initially submitted to a bibliometric analysis. Finally, 150 papers published in a variety of academic journals specializing in the field of Entrepreneurship, KM and Higher Education were analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis to minimize mistakes in interpreting findings of collected studies. Findings KM within entrepreneurial university is a research area of growing importance. Findings show that literature on KM models and tools in the entrepreneurial university is fragmented and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis shows heterogeneous literature, but four major research streams emerge: knowledge transfer in university–industry collaboration; knowledge creation in entrepreneurship education; KM processes for university spin-offs; entrepreneurial university to support knowledge-based regional development. The results show a failure to address the implications of findings for policy makers, which risks making KM in entrepreneurial universities research irrelevant. Research limitations/implications Although different structured literature reviews (SLRs) exist separately in the field of KM and entrepreneurial universities, to the authors’ best knowledge, no studies exist in the intersection between the two fields. Originality/value The paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive SLR of the articles dealing with models and processes of KM in the entrepreneurial university. Despite the increasing literature, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized, thus requiring more systematic and holistic studies, considering both the economic and the social aspects of KM within universities.

Humanising agricultural extension: A review,2021,0,Topic_0_agriculture_agricultural_food,1.0,"Agricultural extension is booming. This interest is critical in the context of numerous pressing issues linked to agrarian change and rural development. Because of its importance, extension has attracted significant critique for its persistent exclusion of social and political factors. In this light, the history of extension can be thought of as a paradigm composed of approaches aimed at increasing agricultural production through the transfer of technologies from experts to farmers, and a series of criticisms of technology transfer as hampered by neglect of socio-political factors, a process labelled ‘rendering technical’. By reviewing criticisms of extension for its rendering of socio-political factors, we account for the rendering of power, place, and people. Equally important, we offer examples that consolidate critiques in order to open the possibility that humanized extension may more successfully support farmers. Our review is an effort to engage extensionists in order to speak about power to those who attempt to speak truth to power.",10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105337,"Cook, Brian R.; Satizábal, Paula; Curnow, Jayne"
The role of digital technologies in production systems for achieving sustainable development goals,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.2998391978572467,"Recently, the academic and scientific debate has been strongly focused on the use of digital technologies to address sustainability issues. In particular, the use of digital technologies could be the key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) declared in the 2030 Agenda. Although several studies have focused on the combination of digital technologies and SDGs, current research has less analyzed them considering specific business functions and processes. Hence, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the triple link “digital technologies - business functions and processes - SDGs” in production systems. The article proposes a mixed approach based on an extensive literature review and the application of the association rules technique. Specifically, the study collected 2496 sustainable business practices supported by 11 digital technologies within 42 business processes for the achievement of the 17 SDGs. Then, this paper employed the Apriori algorithm to intercept the main combinations between digital technologies, business processes, and SDGs. The results suggest that artificial intelligence, geospatial technologies, blockchain, Internet of Things, and 3D printing can contribute to the achievement of SDGs 6,7, 12, and 13 in different business processes.

How do Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Stocks co-move with traditional and alternative assets in the age of the 4th industrial revolution? Implications and Insights for the COVID-19 period,2021,-1,Outliers,0.10237016309626866,"This study investigates the interdependence between AI & Robotics stocks and traditional (including stocks and bonds) and alternative (commodities and cryptocurrencies) assets, employing wavelet coherence analysis in time-frequency space. We further provide a fresh perspective on potential hedging and diversification benefits of AI & Robotics stocks. Overall, our results suggest that co-movements between AI & Robotics stocks and other assets significantly depend on the wavelet decomposition levels, suggesting time-scale-dependent investment benefits. Wavelet coherences and correlations have substantially increased, mostly in the low frequencies, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government securities exhibit safe haven properties for investors at the highest and lowest scales. Even if cryptocurrencies can provide hedging benefits over the full sample, these benefits seem to be diminished during the COVID-19 period. We observe substantially higher co-movements of AI stocks with the composite stock index, corporate bonds, and commodities at all scales after March 2020, implying that inclusion of these assets in AI & Robotics stock portfolios may not enhance risk-adjusted portfolio performance in times of market turbulence.

This systematic review offers an overview of the state-of-the-art literature and practice, where 46 works meeting the inclusion criteria were interactively classified in 11 use case clusters. The work follows the content analysis approach where the material evaluation was empirically enriched with 20 interviews to assess the cluster's business value and ease of implementation through triangulation. This is the first systematic review in the area of operations and supply chain management utilizing the Computer Classification System as the de facto standard in computer science for clarity in the terminology of these emerging technologies. In matching the literature search with the interview results, a mismatch was found between the reviewed literature and the expert's assessments. For instance, the cluster cost analysis deserves higher research attention as well as supplier sustainability. Moreover, there seems to be a gap in the operational area, which many believe to be first considered due to data availability.

Place-based policies – How to do them and why,2025,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7250252159853061,"Place-based policies had a bad reputation for decades, if they received any attention at all. This has recently changed, for two reasons. First, many countries have experienced political backlashes from rising spatial economic disparities. Populist movements received the highest support in economically backward regions, which had been hit by severe local shocks. By trying to foster spatial economic cohesion, regional policies have become an attempt to insure against those political trends and to save liberal democracies altogether. Second, recent theoretical and empirical research has challenged the leading paradigm of spatial equilibrium analysis, according to which place-based policies are an inefficient interference into the market-based resource allocation. In this paper, I review those arguments and how their balance has changed over time. I argue that the demand for place-based policies is likely to increase in the future, as new digital technologies might reinforce urban-rural divides. But even if the general case for place-based policies now seems to be more widely accepted, the question remains what exactly should be done and which type of programs generate the highest return. Digging through the vast evaluation literature, I try to derive some robust lessons how to conduct place-based policies in practise.",10.1016/j.gcrs.2024.100003,"Suedekum, Jens"

The significance of securing as a critical component of information security: An Australian narrative,2019,-1,Outliers,0.19951256223174998,"As information security is called upon to operate in increasingly unstable spaces, the role of the information security practitioner becomes ever more complex. Successful information security practice depends on tactics and strategies that situate the need for protection within organisational goals. These tactics and strategies have become progressively important as organisations are disrupted by digital technology. The locus of control is unpredictably distributed across groups within an organisation. Finding consensus about the need for security thus becomes challenging. Information security controls are an important part of the control structure but increasingly they are negotiated controls, making the process of securing as important as the security mechanisms themselves. We employ broader political and social theories of security, most notably Smith (2005), to analyse data from nine semi-structured interviews of Australian information security practitioners. Our findings delineate the interlinking concepts of securing and security. Security is straightforward. It is a state of being secure. Securing, on the other hand, is complex. It is a consensus-seeking, value-engagement process that enables the attainment of security. Through this analysis, we identify processes and techniques of securing tacitly employed by the participants. Central to effective securing practice is a participant's ability to, ‘get the security message right.’ The message is used to create an agreed value consensus across conflict-ridden environments. We contend that securing is often undervalued and not recognised as a distinct theoretical part of the discipline of information security. However, given the complexity and uncertainty of information security practice, we argue that securing needs to be considered as a critical component of being secure.",10.1016/j.cose.2019.101601,"Burdon, Mark; Coles-Kemp, Lizzie"
Understanding use of evidence in AI ethics guidelines development through a PRISMA-ETHICS informed scoping review of guidelines,2025,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Objectives There have been recent calls for new ethics guidelines regarding the use of artificial intelligence in research.

This paper provides a PRISMA-ETHICS informed scoping review of approaches to ethics guideline development, the structures of ethics guidelines, and their audiences and purposes drawing on the context of education and AI. Search and synthesis approach A search of scholarly and grey literature was conducted to identify both ethics guidelines and material discussing their development; n = 592 distinct items were identified, including 182 that identified via recent reviews of AI ethics guidelines. n = 47 guideline-sets were identified as ‘guidelines’. Data extraction and analysis Guidelines were analysed with respect to their development approach, audience and purpose, and structural elements through which guidance is delivered; most included statements regarding their development approach (79 %) and audience (72 %). Where evidence underpinning the guidance was discussed, it was largely at a global content level (69 %), rather than with respect to the specific context/domain of the guideline use, principles drawn on, or approaches and strategies one might adopt in navigating ethical issues (23, 29, and 21 % respectively). Across the guidelines the only universal feature was the provision of an overview statement. We conclude with recommendations regarding the development of ethics guidelines, and their structure.

Sustainable energy development: How can the tension between energy security and energy transition be measured and managed in South Africa?,2018,-1,Outliers,0.22388942533046635,"The objective of this paper is to serve as a decision aid for energy security policies and programmes in the context of a low carbon energy transition in South Africa. A concept-to-design prototyping matrix for energy security planning inclusive of energy services is presented. It is recommended that energy security design and planning frameworks should be self-defined and government accepted at the country level to be effective for sustainable energy development. The tension between energy security and energy transition is identified as a systemic risk and the concept of a meta-indicator is introduced to measure this transition gap which is modelled along an adaptive frontier. Complexity is explored as one of the three hallmarks of risk, as well as in its contribution to measurement challenges. A multi-scale, multi-speed heuristic model of a socio-energy system transition is illustrated and indicative South African energy supply and demand baselines and risk indicators are measured. The ratio of useful exergy output to final energy input (25%) is advanced as the efficiency indicator “closest” and “earliest” to energy services, and a transdisciplinary monitoring and evaluation framework centred on jumping indicators is proposed for strategic monitoring and evaluative learning. Adaptive programmes are recommended because they are antifragile, and the concept of a resilience boundary is introduced for further development.

By combining information from two datasets of 10,074 ERC grants (representing 8361 individual grantees) and 2186 PoC proposals, and using automated machine learning, we can identify the main predictors of the propensity to apply and to win. Doing so fills a void in the literature on likelihood to apply. The results reveal major differences between potential and actual beneficiaries, due to decisions about applying for a grant and evaluations of the proposals. The decision to apply is affected by the interaction between the characteristics of the PoC funding scheme, the ERC grantee, and his/her environment.

HR analytics-as-practice: a systematic literature review,2025,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.15991399678605248,"Purpose Human resource analytics (HRA) is an HR activity that companies and academics increasingly pay attention to. Existing literature conceptualises HRA mostly from an objectivist perspective, which limits understanding of actual HRA activities in the complex organisational environment. This paper therefore draws on the practice-based approach, using a novel framework to conceptualise HRA-as-practice. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a systematic literature review of 100 academic and practitioner-oriented publications to analyse existing HRA literature in relation to practice theory, using the “HRA-as-practice” frame. Findings The authors identify the main practices involved in HRA, by whom and how these practices are enacted, and reveal three topics in nomological network of HRA-as-practice: HRA technology, HRA outcomes and HRA hindrances and facilitators, which the authors suggest might actualize enactment of HRA practices. Practical implications The authors offer HR function and HR professionals a basic ground to evaluate HRA as a highly contextual activity that can potentially generate business value and increase HR impact when seen as a complex interaction between HRA practices, HRA practitioners and HRA praxis. The findings also help HR practitioners understand multiple factors that influence the practice of HRA. Originality/value This systematic review differs from the previous reviews in two ways.

Challenges and opportunities for biochar to promote circular economy and carbon neutrality,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7254518237797962,"Biochar, derived from unused biomass, is widely considered for its potential to deal with climate change problems. Global interest in biochar is attributed to its ability to sequester carbon in soil and to remediate aquatic environment from water pollution. As soil conditioner and/or adsorbent, biochar offers opportunity through a circular economy (CE) paradigm. While energy transition continues, progress toward low-emissions materials accelerates their advance towards net-zero emissions. However, none of existing works addresses CE-based biochar management to achieve carbon neutrality. To reflect its novelty, this work provides a critical overview of challenges and opportunities for biochar to promote CE and carbon neutrality. This article also offers seminal perspectives about strengthening biomass management through CE and resource recovery paradigms, while exploring how the unused biomass can promote net zero emissions in its applications. By consolidating scattered knowledge in the body of literature into one place, this work uncovers new research directions to close the loops by implementing the circularity of biomass resources in various fields. It is conclusive from a literature survey of 113 articles (2003–2023) that biomass conversion into biochar can promote net zero emissions and CE in the framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Depending on their physico-chemical properties, biochar can become a suitable feedstock for CE. Biochar application as soil enrichment offsets 12% of CO2 emissions by land use annually. Adding biochar to soil can improve its health and agricultural productivity, while minimizing about 1/8 of CO2 emissions. Biochar can also sequester CO2 in the long-term and prevent the release of carbon back into the atmosphere after its decomposition. This practice could sequester 2.5 gigatons (Gt) of CO2 annually. With the global biochar market reaching USD 368.85 million by 2028, this work facilitates biochar with its versatile characteristics to promote carbon neutrality and CE applications.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117429,"Kurniawan, Tonni Agustiono; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Liang, Xue; Goh, Hui Hwang; Gikas, Petros; Chong, Kok-Keong; Chew, Kit Wayne"
Brand Network Booster: A new system for improving brand connectivity,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.19226752499986302,"This paper presents a new decision support system offered for an in-depth analysis of semantic networks, which can provide insights for a better exploration of a brand’s image and the improvement of its connectivity. In terms of network analysis, we show that this goal is achieved by solving an extended version of the Maximum Betweenness Improvement problem, which includes the possibility of considering adversarial nodes, constrained budgets, and weighted networks – where connectivity improvement can be obtained by adding links or increasing the weight of existing connections. Our contribution includes a new algorithmic framework and the integration of this framework into a software system called Brand Network Booster (BNB), which supports brand connectivity evaluation and improvement. We present this new system together with three case studies, and we also discuss its performance. Our tool and approach are valuable to both network scholars and in facilitating strategic decision-making processes for marketing and communication managers across various sectors, be it public or private.",10.1016/j.cie.2024.110389,"Cancellieri, Jacopo; Didimo, Walter; Fronzetti Colladon, Andrea; Montecchiani, Fabrizio; Vestrelli, Roberto"
Social media in accounting research: A review and future research agenda,2024,-1,Outliers,0.0904405319033939,"In recent years, accounting scholars have shown growing interest in utilizing social media (SM) for research. Using a structured literature review of 86 articles, this study aims to reconcile insights from diverse literature to understand the current trends in SM accounting research and propose an agenda for future studies. Our findings reveal that SM accounting research is still at an early stage despite the increase of articles in recent years. In particular, we find that most studies focus on (publicly listed) corporate use of SM (mostly Twitter and Facebook) to disseminate financial and non-financial information in the North American and European regions. However, there is still a limited understanding of how SM interactions among various parties may push for greater transparency in different forms of organizations and in countries where stakeholder interests are less protected. While SM studies use system-oriented (such as institutional, legitimacy, and stakeholder theories) and economic-based theories, most studies only use SM as an empirical platform and rely on empirically developed arguments without reference to explicit theories. Finally, we identify common research themes and suggest promising avenues for future accounting research.",10.1016/j.intaccaudtax.2024.100595,"Nerantzidis, Michail; Tampakoudis, Ioannis; She, Chaoyuan"
Information Quality for Effective Asset Management: A literature review,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8599856212965075,"Information quality is critical to successful asset management decision-making. Substandard quality information will likely cause significant negative short- and long-term consequences. The ongoing digital transformation in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry has influenced ways to manage physical assets. Yet many asset owners lack a clear understanding of identifying indispensable quality dimensions that satisfy the business, system, and technical requirements. This paper aims to comprehensively analyse asset information quality management with a systematic literature review. The study reveals that the quality dimension of ‘accuracy’ alone cannot support various asset management functions. Additionally, quality deficiencies remain in Building Information Modelling (BIM)-based project delivery handover documents, establishing insufficient asset baselines for future planning. Moreover, the limited knowledge of the quality complications of information generated through technical solutions suggests additional work is required to gain insights into vital quality dimensions. The findings of this study underpin the basis for classifying quality dimensions to support essential asset management processes while pointing to future study areas.",10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.09.213,"Chang, Janet Y.; Garcia, Jorge Merino; Xie, Xiang; Moretti, Nicola; Parlikad, Ajith"

This bibliometric analysis signals the emergence of a substantial research community based in Asia and the Middle East, whose production is distinct from North American and European-centric evaluation studies. While the latter primarily address methodological challenges related to sustainability issues in social policy, organizational capacity building, and public health, the broader SA literature centers on life-cycle assessments to integrate the analysis of environmental and socioeconomic effects in such domains as biodiversity, energy efficiency, urban planning, alternative agriculture, and supply chain management. This mapping exercise highlights the global distribution of research output and identifies existing gaps and potential future cross-fertilization. The transdisciplinary SA literature can draw from theory-based designs attuned to complexity and systems thinking.

Adaptive response for climate change challenges for small and vulnerable coastal area (SVCA) countries: Qatar perspective,2023,-1,Outliers,0.129436145778705,"Climate change has already been affecting the entire globe in all aspects of life. Along with mitigation efforts, adaptive response actions are gaining increasingly urgent importance for many regions to considerably reduce the most severe impacts of climate change on social and physical infrastructure. As the severity and frequency of climate change impacts and consequences grow fast and highly alarming, particularly for small and vulnerable coastal area (SVCA) countries, the urgency and magnitude of the crises call for immediate and more adaptive responses. This study proposes that SVCA countries, being on the frontline of climate change vulnerabilities, impacts, and risks, should prioritize their resources and capacity and focus on developing and implementing immediate, tailored, adaptive response policies, plans, and actions. Long-term mitigation efforts would not help them reduce their current or immediate vulnerability in the short-term, as long as large countries with comparably huge populations, economies, heavy industrial dependences, and extreme consumption levels do not change their courses significantly. Therefore, this study presents a framework of climate change, sustainability, resilience, risk reduction, and adaptive response as a nexus to conceptualize the problem and solutions properly. Such a framework is needed to develop synergies between climate change and immediate adaptive response for such countries. The study analyzes Qatar, a typical SVCA country, assessing its current vulnerabilities & risks and potential physical, social, and economic challenges. Finally, it concludes with a discussion on recommended adaptive responses proposed for Qatar.",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.103969,"Khan, Shoukat Alim; Al Rashid, Ans; Koç, Muammer"
Reinvigorating algal cultivation for biomass production with digital twin technology - a smart sustainable infrastructure,2024,0,Topic_0_agriculture_agricultural_food,1.0,"Industry 5.0 raises awareness towards converting conventional industrial technologies into smart technologies integrated with sustainable infrastructure for efficiently handling process systems, making them more energy and cost-efficient. New disruptive technologies are emerging due to recent scientific and technical developments, which profoundly affect various process systems. One such case of consideration is the algal cultivation for biomass production (ACB). A technology called an algal digital twin (ADT) has a great deal of promise to change existing ACB (For example raceway pond) into sustainable algal management systems (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Temperature, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), pH, Chlorophyll-a, etc.), and to develop their infrastructure in making them more energy efficient and cost-effective for the algal biomass cultivation. However, despite a recent increase in attention, there have not been adequate investigations exploring the challenges of deploying ADTs for controlling and monitoring ACB. This review provides a systematic literature analysis on adopting an ADT into ACB, which could address major difficulties and unresolved problems of the ACB. Also, this study identifies several key categories of hurdles, such as interconnection and semantics, facilities, acquiring data and actuation, data reliability, modelling (Artificial Intelligence of Things), simulation run, decision making, digitalization of data, accountability, as well as social concerns. Additionally, case studies for the ACB towards lipid production and wastewater treatment using ADT are reported. Overall, this comprehensive review aims to help practitioners gain insight into the deployment of ADT into ACB systems, “A way towards creating a sustainable smart infrastructure for ACB”.",10.1016/j.algal.2024.103779,"Sheik, Abdul Gaffar; Kumar, Arvind; Ansari, Faiz Ahmad; Raj, Vinay; Peleato, Nicolás M; Patan, Ameer Khan; Kumari, Sheena; Bux, Faizal"
Opportunities and challenges for the waste management in emerging and frontier countries through industrial symbiosis,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8816454648859122,"The development of industrial and commercial activities in developing countries has increased the amount of waste generated by economic activities, which has generated environmental problems due to the complexity of waste management. Due to the economic, environmental, social, and sustainability implications, proper waste management has become a worldwide concern. In response to this problem, strategies have been implemented to develop clean energy, improve the efficiency of industrial resources, and recycle and reuse materials. As a result, the concept of industrial symbiosis (IS) has emerged as a strategy for waste utilization in a productive chain, based on physical exchanges of waste and materials, which finds ways to use the waste from one industry as inputs or raw materials for the other, all supported by business collaboration. This work aims to identify the opportunities and challenges that emerging and frontier countries have for waste utilization through the IS approach through a literature review. The needs that triggered the IS and how researchers materialized this approach to integrate the harnessing resources and materials in economic activities were identified. This paper identifies how emerging and frontier countries realize solid waste management through IS, and highlights opportunities for governments, researchers, and stakeholders to make effective decisions to achieve sustainable development, reduce environmental concerns and address current waste management issues. The literature review identified IS as an excellent way to dispose of and use the solid waste but also showed that emerging and frontier countries face many challenges in solid waste management due to the lack of policies focused on sustainability, lack of communication and trust among stakeholders, low use of technology in the industrial sector and technical barriers.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132607,"Boom Cárcamo, Efrain A.; Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita"

Beyond “dummy variable”: progress and potential of gender research in management accounting,2025,-1,Outliers,0.09104906284244418,"Purpose This study aims to examine how gender is conceptualised and addressed within management accounting research, moving beyond its use as a mere “control variable” or “dummy variable”. It identifies dominant themes, highlights ongoing research gaps and proposes directions for developing more inclusive and critically engaged research. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review of gender-related studies in management accounting was conducted, covering articles published in ranked “accounting journals” between 1990 and 2024. Thematic analysis was applied to synthesise key findings and highlight research gaps. Findings The study identifies four dominant themes in the literature, revealing the persistent underrepresentation of gender-focused research in management accounting. While existing studies acknowledge gender, they largely focus on workplace dynamics and overlook how management accounting practices reflect, reinforce or challenge gendered structures. The study underscores the need for deeper theoretical engagement – particularly with feminist and intersectional perspectives – to critically assess gendered power dynamics in management accounting. Research limitations/implications This study provides an impetus for advancing gender research in management accounting by promoting theoretical diversification, methodological pluralism and greater attention to intersectional and contextual dimensions. Originality/value By synthesising existing research and identifying critical gaps, this study calls for a shift from viewing gender as a control or dummy variable towards a more integrated, theoretically informed and critically engaged approach to gender in management accounting.",10.1108/JAOC-05-2024-0158,"Ahmed, Zahir Uddin"

Questioning mobility as a service: Unanticipated implications for society and governance,2020,-1,Outliers,0.45483329657236343,"In this paper we focus on the development of a new service model for accessing transport, namely Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and present one of the first critical analyses of the rhetoric surrounding the concept. One central assumption of one prevalent MaaS conceptualization is that transport services are bundled into service packages for monthly payment, as in the telecommunication or media service sectors. Various other forms of MaaS are being developed but all tend to offer door-to-door multi-modal mobility services, brokered via digital platforms connecting users and service operators. By drawing on literature concerned with socio-technical transitions, we address two multi-layered questions. First, to what extent can the MaaS promises (to citizens and cities) be delivered, and what are the unanticipated societal implications that could arise from a wholesale adoption of MaaS in relation to key issues such as wellbeing, emissions and social inclusion? Second, what are de facto challenges for urban governance if the packaged services model of MaaS is widely adopted, and what are the recommended responses? To address these questions, we begin by considering the evolution of intelligent transport systems that underpin the current vision of MaaS and highlight how the new business model could provide a mechanism to make MaaS truly disruptive. We then identify a set of plausible unanticipated societal effects that have implications for urban planning and transport governance. This is followed by a critical assessment of the persuasive rhetoric around MaaS that makes grand promises about efficiency, choice and freedom. Our conclusion is that the range of possible unanticipated consequences carries risks that require public intervention (i.e. steering) for reasons of both efficiency and equity.",10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.033,"Pangbourne, Kate; Mladenović, Miloš N.; Stead, Dominic; Milakis, Dimitris"

Vulnerability to Cyberattacks and Sociotechnical Solutions for Health Care Systems: Systematic Review,2024,-1,Outliers,0.1449310190160668,"Background Health care organizations worldwide are faced with an increasing number of cyberattacks and threats to their critical infrastructure. These cyberattacks cause significant data breaches in digital health information systems, which threaten patient safety and privacy. Objective From a sociotechnical perspective, this paper explores why digital health care systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks and provides sociotechnical solutions through a systematic literature review (SLR). Methods An SLR using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) was conducted by searching 6 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Springer) and a journal (Management Information Systems Quarterly) for articles published between 2012 and 2022 and indexed using the following keywords: “(cybersecurity OR cybercrime OR ransomware) AND (healthcare) OR (cybersecurity in healthcare).” Reports, review articles, and industry white papers that focused on cybersecurity and health care challenges and solutions were included. Only articles published in English were selected for the review. Results In total, 5 themes were identified: human error, lack of investment, complex network-connected end-point devices, old legacy systems, and technology advancement (digitalization). We also found that knowledge applications for solving vulnerabilities in health care systems between 2012 to 2022 were inconsistent. Conclusions This SLR provides a clear understanding of why health care systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks and proposes interventions from a new sociotechnical perspective. These solutions can serve as a guide for health care organizations in their efforts to prevent breaches and address vulnerabilities. To bridge the gap, we recommend that health care organizations, in partnership with educational institutions, develop and implement a cybersecurity curriculum for health care and intelligence information sharing through collaborations; training; awareness campaigns; and knowledge application areas such as secure design processes, phase-out of legacy systems, and improved investment. Additional studies are needed to create a sociotechnical framework that will support cybersecurity in health care systems and connect technology, people, and processes in an integrated manner.",10.2196/46904,"Ewoh, Pius; Vartiainen, Tero"

How can SMEs successfully navigate VUCA environment: The role of agility in the digital transformation era,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7753531576476832,"Organizational agility, that is the ability to anticipate or respond quickly to external changes, is essential to survive and compete in today's turbulent landscape, characterized by technological advancements and digitalization. Research on capabilities that enable firms to be agile in the so called VUCA environments, is still nascent. Hence, it is important to explore the antecedents of firm agility and to identify the factors enabling them to better compete. Even more so in the case of SMEs, as they are more vulnerable in hypercompetitive business environments and, at the same time, agility has been less studied in this context. Focusing on SMEs, the study investigates three antecedents of agility, namely digital technologies capability, relational capability and innovation capability, and the effects of agility on three outcomes, namely financial performance, product, and process innovation. Our findings indicate that these capabilities contribute to build organizational agility in SMEs and that, in turn, agility has a positive impact on performance, thus confirming that agility contributes to the success of SMEs and that digital technologies play a central role in this process. Thus, it is of strategic importance for SMEs to increase their efforts to develop these capabilities to build enduring businesses. They should nurture a relational and innovative culture, as well as transform their business culture starting from digital technologies.",10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121227,"Troise, Ciro; Corvello, Vincenzo; Ghobadian, Abby; O'Regan, Nicholas"

Smart-Circular strategies for managing biomass resource challenges: A novel approach using circular intuitionistic fuzzy methods,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"The growing global population and the need for sustainable energy due to nonrenewable resources necessitate innovative solutions to meet energy demands while minimizing environmental impacts. The cardinal motivation behind this research is to move towards efficient biomass resource management in order to overcome environmental uncertainty and ambiguity and mitigate adverse environmental impacts and climate change. The research literature and international experts’ opinions were reviewed to present the biomass EEEGOT model. This important study came up with three new methods: a Circular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (CIF-SWARA) method for ranking challenges; a Circular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (CIF-DEMATEL) method for picking the best challenges; and a Circular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (CIF-QFD) method to put environmental challenges in order of importance and deal with them. According to the weight evaluation results, the organizational dimension (0.188) and environmental dimension (0.177) had the highest weights. Thus, they are considered the major challenges that require immediate attention from managers, decision-makers, and stakeholders. Additionally, the findings of conceptual modeling (TISM) indicated that culture, leadership, governance policy, human resources, and regulatory barriers are the most fundamental components affecting other components. The novelty of this study lies in the theoretical expansion of the research literature by proposing a model through a comprehensive approach to circular bioeconomy that can be used as a base by relevant decision-makers and researchers. However, to expand fuzzy science, three methods were developed in fuzzy logic. Therefore, since biomass management requires a comprehensive understanding of the challenges facing it, their precise prioritization, and the use of smart strategies and solutions, this research provides insights, useful tools, and solutions for organizational and industrial managers, decision makers, and scholars. They can use these resources to investigate, prioritize, and overcome these challenges. On the other hand, the focus of this research is on ignoring the linear economy and applying the circular concept in order to achieve several goals, including sustainable development, energy security, effective climate change, and reduced levels of poverty due to its global implications.",10.1016/j.enconman.2024.118690,"Alinejad, Saeed; Alimohammadlou, Moslem; Abbasi, Abbas; Mirghaderi, Seyed-Hadi"

Due to the dearth in initial search results, the search was broadened to include non-academic publications and practitioner case reports. The study identified components of digital health, components of innovation relevant to the healthcare domain and components of digital ecosystems. It further suggests, within the context, a comprehensive definition of digital health innovation ecosystems. A conceptual framework for digital health innovation ecosystems is proposed. The findings from this study could conceivably be a step towards enabling a common understanding of practitioners, professionals and academics within the digital health domain as well as a basis for further studies on digital health innovation ecosystems.",10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.149,"Iyawa, Gloria Ejehiohen; Herselman, Marlien; Botha, Adele"

A systematic review of digital internal communication,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7526564341186838,"The digitalization of greater society has permeated organizations, where managers are reassessing how internal communication is practiced and defined, particularly in the context of public relations and strategic communication. These changes were already underway before the COVID-19 pandemic, which strongly highlighted the importance of effective internal communication. Now more than ever, digital transformation is profoundly affecting internal communication, yet there are substantial gaps in our understanding of the current situation. This study aims to identify and provide an overview of the research in the area through a systematic review of 77 research studies published in 52 journals between the beginning of 1990 and November 2022. The findings reveal the evolution of research on digital internal communication and highlight geographical, theoretical, and methodological gaps that should be addressed in future work. First of all, the effectiveness of different internal communication channels needs to be thoroughly researched. This includes the effectiveness of collaboration tools and platforms, the influence of channels that enable remote work, and the significance of gamification and an interactive communication approach. Also, digitalization in internal communication should be given more attention from a social perspective, underlining the effects of internal communication digitalization on employees and their satisfaction as well as employee concerns with privacy, control, and other ethical dilemmas regarding easy accessibility to data.

Examining the limitations of AI in business and the need for human insights using Interpretive Structural Modelling,2024,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.4382354578545478,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business settings is rapidly increasing, yet significant limitations hinder its effective use and adoption. Understanding these limitations and their interrelationships is crucial for enhancing AI implementation. Despite growing research, there is a lack of a comprehensive model that systematically identifies and elucidates the factors influencing AI limitations in business environments. This study employs Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), combined with MICMAC analysis and an extensive literature review, to develop such a model. We identified 15 key factors and analyzed their driving and dependence powers to understand their interrelationships. Most factors, such as contextual understanding, transparency, intuition, emotional intelligence, ethics, bias, tacit knowledge, creativity, credibility, and reliability, were found to be autonomous. Accountability and privacy emerged as the strongest driving forces, while trust and adaptability exhibited the highest dependence and lowest driving power. This research offers a comprehensive understanding of AI limitations and their interrelationships, providing valuable insights for managers and businesses. The findings can aid in making more informed decisions about AI implementation and in developing strategies to mitigate these limitations. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of combining AI with human insight to overcome these challenges.

Conceptualizing the Circular Economy (Revisited): An Analysis of 221 Definitions,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.768753098082243,"In the past decade, use of the circular economy (CE) concept by scholars and practitioners has grown steadily. In a 2017 article, Kirchherr et al. found that the CE concept is interpreted and implemented in a variety of ways. While multiple interpretations of CE can enrich scholarly perspectives, differentiation and fragmentation can also impede consolidation of the concept. Some scholarship has discussed these trends in context-specific cases, but no large-scale, systematic study has analysed whether such consolidation has taken place across the field. This article fills this gap by analysing 221 recent CE definitions, making several notable findings. First, the concept has seen both consolidation and differentiation in the past five years. Second, definitional trends are emerging that potentially have more meaning for scholarship than for practice. Third, scholars increasingly recommend a fundamental systemic shift to enable CE, particularly within supply chains. Fourth, sustainable development is frequently considered the principal aim of CE, but questions linger about whether CE can mutually support environmental sustainability and economic development. Finally, recent studies argue that CE transition relies on a broad alliance of stakeholders, including producers, consumers, policymakers, and scholars. This study contributes an updated systematic analysis of CE definitions and conceptualizations that serves as an empirical snapshot of current scholarly thinking. It thereby provides a basis for further research on whether conceptual consolidation is needed and how it can be facilitated for practical purposes.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2023.107001,"Kirchherr, Julian; Yang, Nan-Hua Nadja; Schulze-Spüntrup, Frederik; Heerink, Maarten J.; Hartley, Kris"

A network analysis using metadata to investigate innovation in clean-tech – Implications for energy policy,2015,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.3396334566908639,"Clean-technology (clean-tech) is a large and increasing sector. Research and development (R&D) is the lifeline of the industry and innovation is fostered by a plethora of high-tech start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Any empirical-based attempt to detect the pattern of technological innovation in the industry is challenging. This paper proposes an investigation of innovation in clean-tech using metadata provided by CrunchBase. Metadata reveal information on markets, products, services and technologies driving innovation in the clean-tech industry worldwide and for San Francisco, the leader in clean-tech innovation with more than two hundred specialised companies. A network analysis using metadata is the employed methodology and the main metrics of the resulting networks are discussed from an economic point of view. The purpose of the paper is to understand specifically specializations and technological complementarities underlying innovative companies, detect emerging industrial clusters at the global and local/metropolitan level and, finally, suggest a way to realize whether observed start-ups, SMEs and clusters follow a technological path of complementary innovation and market opportunity or, instead, present a risk of lock-in.

"A futures perspective of health, climate change and poverty in the United States",2021,-1,Outliers,0.15775285469138903,"Trend assessments suggest that poverty and health will worsen in the United States in the coming decades and that climate change will exacerbate these trends. An aging society, lack of affordable housing, and automation threaten the economic sustainability of millions of households. Despair, drug abuse, and unhealthy lifestyles have led to the first decline in life spans in the U.S. during a non-war period. Extreme weather events caused by climate change can be anticipated to disrupt economic activities and destroy homes and infrastructure, pushing millions of more Americans into poverty. A warming climate threatens vulnerable individuals, such as elders, with heat stress, increasing levels of air pollution, and increasing risks from new tropical diseases entering the country. It is anticipated that climate change will force tens of millions of Americans from their homes, creating The Great Migration (TGM) scenario. The welfare of the migrants will depend on what types of human settlements they migrate to. Seven different types of settlements are depicted within the TGM scenario, such as Willow Pond settlements that represent radical redesigns of suburbs to make them sustainable and resilient to climate change.

The approaches are very diverse: the scope of the provision can be narrow (just automated decisions producing legal or similarly detrimental effects) or wide (any decision with a significant impact) and even specific safeguards proposed are very diverse. After this overview, this article will also address the following questions: are Member States free to broaden the scope of automated decision-making regulation? Are ‘positive decisions’ allowed under Article 22, GDPR, as some Member States seem to affirm? Which safeguards can better guarantee rights and freedoms of the data subject? In particular, while most Member States refers just to the three safeguards mentioned at Article 22(3) (i.e. subject's right to express one's point of view; right to obtain human intervention; right to contest the decision), three approaches seem very innovative: a) some States guarantee a right to legibility/explanation about the algorithmic decisions (France and Hungary); b) other States (Ireland and United Kingdom) regulate human intervention on algorithmic decisions through an effective accountability mechanism (e.g. notification, explanation of why such contestation has not been accepted, etc.); c) another State (Slovenia) require an innovative form of human rights impact assessments on automated decision-making.",10.1016/j.clsr.2019.05.002,"Malgieri, Gianclaudio"

This research performed a systematic literature review to identify how the CE-I4.0 nexus, the combination of CE practices and I4.0 technologies, could contribute to achieving the SDG. A total of 50 peer-review articles that addressed the simultaneous or individual link between CE and I4.0 to sustainability form the review portfolio. The articles were first screened with regard to the I4.0 technologies and CE practices applied, and further analyzed in order to understand the stronger links to the SDG.

Modeling and analysis of customer journey enablers: A case study of religious pilgrimage,2023,-1,Outliers,0.038279466719341806,"Customer journey theory has been discussed in service and management-related fields, but in the context of tourism, there is a lack of research on customer journeys and their enablers. Such research work is challenging, mainly because the customer journey involves the subjectivity of customers' experience and is influenced by multiple factors. Therefore, this study proposes a deduction analysis of an interpretive structural model (ISM) to construct a correlation analysis of customer journey enablers by collecting data on tourists’ actual experiences of pilgrimage. The importance of customer journey enablers is evaluated through the analytic network process (ANP), and the characteristics of the driving power and dependence power of the enablers are classified. This research analyzes the content of religious pilgrimages, establishes 12 enablers for customer journeys, such as “quality of life”, “local security”, “social stability”, and “local friendship”, and develops four customer journey paths through ISM. The important differences in journey path enablers are analyzed by the ANP and cross-impact matrix multiplication (MICMAC) under the influence of different ISM-level contents of each customer journey path. It is hoped that the discussion of the enablers of customer journey paths in religious pilgrimages can enhance tourists' understanding of religious pilgrimages and provide a management framework for tourism departments to help tourists enjoy the experience of local religion, humanities, and the natural environment.",10.1016/j.jhtm.2023.10.004,"Lin, Ling-Zhong"

Their environmentally friendly label needs to be analyzed according to the city's context; their distribution and collection logistics impacts, and the vehicle's service life. The review shows significant differences in the way cities have regulated the service. One of the most significant potential contributions from DSES to urban mobility is the possibility to be integrated with public transport, implementing the Mobility-as-a-Service concept.",10.1080/15568318.2022.2044097,"Orozco-Fontalvo, Mauricio; Llerena, Luis; Cantillo, Victor"
Floods in Pakistan: A state-of-the-art review,2023,-1,Outliers,0.13590108133836395,"Floods inflict devastating impacts worldwide. The frequency and severity of floods have notably increased as a result of climate change. Pakistan, in particular, has experienced two of the most catastrophic flooding events in recent years: the 2010 super floods and the 2022 monsoon floods, affecting millions of people. The tangible impacts of these events are still not fully understood. However, no study has been found that comprehensively explains the current state of knowledge, major research areas, and themes within the context of flood studies in Pakistan. To address this research gap, this study uses bibliometric and thematic analysis to conduct a state-of-the-art systematic literature review on Pakistan's floods. The dataset comprises 601 research articles obtained from the Scopus database. The bibliometric analysis reveals an upward trend in publications on flood-related topics, primarily within the scope of environmental, earth and planetary, and social sciences. These publications involve the contributions of 160 authors from 160 different institutions and 57 countries across the globe. The thematic analysis identifies several major research areas, including gender, social capital, livelihood, food security, risk perception, risk and vulnerability assessment, socioeconomic impacts, and the application of GIS and Remote Sensing. The study also presents indicators and quantitative methods to assess flood risk and vulnerability. The study recommends that future research examine the socioeconomic and institutional challenges associated with flood risk reduction. Additionally, integrating climate change adaptation and flood risk reduction can lead to developing policies and frameworks to promote flood-resilient communities.",10.1016/j.nhres.2023.06.005,"Waseem, Hassam Bin; Rana, Irfan Ahmad"
Surfing the third wave of computing: A framework for research into eObjects,2015,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.40890091617885205,"During the last two decades, a “third wave of computing” has emerged: a move from a model of accessing the Internet and other internetworks almost exclusively via a desktop computer to alternative forms of distributed information technologies, such as smartphones, wearable computers, and sensors and microprocessors embedded in everyday objects. This paper undertakes a critical review of the literature that offers and discusses definitions of this “third wave”. Not surprisingly in an area of innovation, definitions are evolving, overlapping and inconsistent. This paper analyses and consolidates the literature in order to identify the key aspects of this new phenomenon. We have coined the term “eObjects”1 for the central element of the “third wave”. The paper presents a framework for research into the technologies and their implications, distinguishing core from common attributes, and identifying categories of inter-device interaction. A subsequent paper will apply the research framework to legal research, with the intention of understanding areas in which litigation can be anticipated, and uncovering areas where the law may not adequately deal with emergent social and business practices.",10.1016/j.clsr.2015.07.001,"Manwaring, Kayleen; Clarke, Roger"
An evaluation of the critical success factors impacting artificial intelligence implementation,2023,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.530376717560987,"AI systems offer organizations great benefits causing decision-makers to invest more in these systems. The advantages of AI cannot be achieved without successful implementation. Thus, it is crucial to recognize the factors impacting the successful implementation of AI. It is also important to assess and rank these factors by their importance to assist decision-makers in implementing these systems and increasing the success rate. Due to its importance, scholars called for studies to expand our knowledge in this critical area. This paper identifies, extracts, and assesses the most critical factors that influence the implementation of AI systems. This study identifies nineteen factors and categorizes them into four categories: organization, technology, process, and environment. The analytical hierarchy process is used to evaluate the factors and the categories. The analysis offers two types of results, at the category level and the level of the factors. The results indicate that technology is the most significant of the four categories. The results also suggest that ethics is the most crucial factor among all nineteen factors. The order of all factors and discussions of the implications of the findings for practice and research are presented in the paper.",10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102545,"Merhi, Mohammad I."
Blockchain in humanitarian operations management: A review of research and practice,2022,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Humanitarian operations management (HOM) defines the broad domain that deals with the management of crisis events and human suffering, and a plethora of research has contributed to this field. Over the recent years, blockchain technology has been signaled throughout the literature as a tool that can support HOM as a result of the technology's enhanced features such as security and auditability. In a bid to explore the application of blockchain technology in HOM, we systematically review the current literature and deployed practices. Our review covers 64 articles that provide contributions which we categorize into four focus areas: (i) overview of blockchain in HOM, (ii) identity and personal data management, (iii) humanitarian logistics, and (iv) humanitarian communications. The majority of the articles that we surveyed focus on the potential benefits of blockchain in HOM, and the enablers and barriers to its adoption. A limited number of theoretical frameworks provide insights into how blockchain can be utilized in HOM to improve operational efficiency, promote trust, and foster collaborations among relief agencies. With the exception of a few pilot programs that have been deployed in the humanitarian setting, we find that the majority of the work addressing the use of blockchain in HOM has not yet been tested in the field, and therefore, little empirical evidence exists to prove blockchain's capabilities in HOM. This paper reports on the major scientific advancements and practical applications for blockchain technology in HOM, as well as promising future research directions on the use of blockchain technology for HOM practitioners and researchers.",10.1016/j.seps.2021.101175,"Hunt, Kyle; Narayanan, Adithya; Zhuang, Jun"
Natural Language Processing in Electronic Health Records in relation to healthcare decision-making: A systematic review,2023,4,Topic_4_healthcare_health_data,0.4513611169823518,"Background: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used to extract clinical insights from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, the lack of annotated data, automated tools, and other challenges hinder the full utilisation of NLP for EHRs. Various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and NLP techniques are studied and compared to understand the limitations and opportunities in this space comprehensively. Methodology: After screening 261 articles from 11 databases, we included 127 papers for full-text review covering seven categories of articles: (1) medical note classification, (2) clinical entity recognition, (3) text summarisation, (4) deep learning (DL) and transfer learning architecture, (5) information extraction, (6) Medical language translation and (7) other NLP applications. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Result and Discussion: EHR was the most commonly used data type among the selected articles, and the datasets were primarily unstructured. Various ML and DL methods were used, with prediction or classification being the most common application of ML or DL. The most common use cases were: the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) classification, clinical note analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) for clinical descriptions and research on psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: We find that the adopted ML models were not adequately assessed. In addition, the data imbalance problem is quite important, yet we must find techniques to address this underlining problem. Future studies should address key limitations in studies, primarily identifying Lupus Nephritis, Suicide Attempts, perinatal self-harmed and ICD-9 classification.",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106649,"Hossain, Elias; Rana, Rajib; Higgins, Niall; Soar, Jeffrey; Barua, Prabal Datta; Pisani, Anthony R.; Turner, Kathryn"
A structured literature review of scientometric research of the knowledge management discipline: a 2021 update,2021,-1,Outliers,0.11817435595728742,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to conduct a structured literature review of scientometric research of the knowledge management (KM) discipline for the 2012–2019 time period. Design/methodology/approach A total of 175 scientometric studies of the KM discipline were identified and analyzed. Findings Scientometric KM research has entered the maturity stage: its volume has been growing, reaching six publications per month in 2019. Scientometric KM research has become highly specialized, which explains many inconsistent findings, and the interests of scientometric KM researchers and their preferred inquiry methods have changed over time. There is a dangerous trend toward a monopoly of the scholarly publishing market which affects researchers’ behavior. To create a list of keywords for database searches, scientometric KM scholars should rely on the formal KM keyword classification schemes, and KM-centric peer-reviewed journals should continue welcoming manuscripts on scientometric topics. Practical implications Stakeholders should realize that the KM discipline may successfully exist as a cluster of divergent schools of thought under an overarching KM umbrella and that the notion of intradisciplinary cohesion and consistency should be abandoned. Journal of Knowledge Management is unanimously recognized as a leading KM journal, but KM researchers should not limit their focus to the body of knowledge documented in the KM-centric publication forums. The top six most productive countries are the USA, the UK, Taiwan, Canada, Australia and China. There is a need for knowledge brokers that may deliver the KM academic body of knowledge to practitioners.

Management Accounting Research: 25 years on,2016,-1,Outliers,0.09028401589074381,"This Editorial introduces and comments on the implications of the papers presented at the 25th Anniversary Conference of Management Accounting Research which was held at the London School of Economics and Political Science in April 2015. It first examines the context in which Management Accounting Research was founded in 1990 and then introduces the six invited review papers. These papers cover a wide range of subjects comprising critical and social theory, managerialist studies, contingency theory, experimental behavioural research and intra-organisational management accounting. Amongst various other recommendations, some of the authors suggest that there is a need for research in management accounting to more effectively build on prior research so as to accumulate knowledge about specific issues and problems. In addition, they suggest that researchers in the different areas (or sub-disciplines) of management accounting should talk to each other more. For instance, insights and findings from qualitative research could be used to inform quantitative studies and vice versa. The later parts of this Editorial discuss opportunities and challenges for management accounting research in the future. In particular, it is pointed out that, compared to when Management Accounting Research was founded in 1990, researchers now have highly theorised understandings of management accounting practices, and one challenge is to use these understandings to try to close the ‘practice-research gap’. It is argued that management accounting theories have had a relatively limited impact on practice and, as there are increasing pressures on universities to demonstrate the impact and value of university research, some suggestions are made about ways of increasing the impact of management accounting research.",10.1016/j.mar.2016.03.002,"Bromwich, Michael; Scapens, Robert W."
AI for the people? Embedding AI ethics in HR and people analytics projects,2024,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Technological advances and the “zeitgeist” led to increased use of AI in HR Analytics. Using machine learning models in this field might be beneficial but requires some unique considerations in how organizations govern, assure, audit, and support the use of AI. While substantial work has been done on AI ethics, organizational implantation studies are rare and often anecdotal, particularly in HR. In this article, we would like to better understand the common ethical considerations and organizational responses for developing AI for HR use and how different organizations engage with them by comparing two case studies. This paper begins by reviewing AI ethical issues specific to HR and describes the common mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. After this introduction, case studies are illustrated, and the organizational responses in both cases are analyzed. The discussion section shows that although the organizations were aware of the AI ethics issues, their responses varied and depended on different governance and self-regulation mechanisms that might have impinged their ability to proactively engage with ethical issues. A second finding is that the organization used only a relatively small set of mitigation strategies proposed in the literature, and we propose several reasons for this. These insights might be important to various organizations deploying or developing AI for HR use that want better governance, assurance, and audit mechanisms to responsibly address the ethical issues raised by AI in this field.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102527,"Bar-Gil, Oshri; Ron, Tom; Czerniak, Ofir"

Companies’ adoption of Smart Technologies to achieve structural ambidexterity: an analysis with SEM,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.32160751087591843,"The transition to “Industry 4.0″ and the adoption of Smart Technologies (STs) are generally driven by expectations of gains in productivity, better control over operations and supply chain processes and, therefore, improved competitiveness. These factors are important to achieve success, but sustainable competitive advantage depends on a company's ability to exploit its current assets, while simultaneously exploring new ways of producing value. The ambidextrous balancing of these two areas requires concerted effort and the capacity to balance paradoxical tensions. Literature has thoroughly covered the aspect of how to overcome the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. However, research has only recently started focusing on the pivotal role that digital technologies may play in this process. Our paper contributes to this nascent literature stream by investigating how STs can operate as antecedents of structural ambidexterity. This study relies on the 3rd CINet Survey (2016–2017) involving over 370 companies worldwide. Leveraging on STs and structural ambidexterity as mediators, we used Structural Equation Modelling to show that manufacturing firms with good business performance are in a favorable position to achieve better innovation performances.

The right of access in automated decision-making: The scope of article 15(1)(h) GDPR in theory and practice,2022,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"The right of access in Article 15 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is essential for empowering data subjects when exercising other data subject rights. In the context of automated decision-making, including profiling, Article 15(1)(h) provides a right to meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. In this research, the notions of ‘meaningful information’, ‘the logic involved’, and ‘the significance and the envisaged consequences’ are analysed. Apart from a legal analysis, empirical research was carried out in 30 countries (27 EU and 3 EFTA EEA Member States), consisting of a survey amongst all Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and interviews with experts of privacy organisations. Several types of potentially meaningful information that could be in scope of right of access requests were assessed, as well as several types of information on the consequences for data subjects. Even though respondents indicate that most of these types of information should be provided upon access requests, the findings show that most of these types of information are rarely or not at all provided in practice. Providing such information strongly depends on the willingness of data controllers to cooperate, as they may balance this against rights and freedoms of others, including intellectual property and trade secrets. Particularly trade secrets are invoked in practice to block or restrict access requests, despite the GDPR stating that these considerations should not lead to a refusal of the request to provide all information to the data subject.",10.1016/j.clsr.2022.105727,"Custers, Bart; Heijne, Anne-Sophie"
"Productive employment and decent work: The impact of AI adoption on psychological contracts, job engagement and employee trust",2021,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"This research examines the tension between the aims of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8), to promote productive employment and decent work, and the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our findings are based on the analysis of 232 survey results, where we tested the effects of AI adoption on workers’ psychological contract, engagement and trust. We find that psychological contracts had a significant, positive effect on job engagement and on trust. Yet, with AI adoption, the positive effect of psychological contracts fell significantly. A further re-examination of the extant literature leads us to posit that AI adoption fosters the creation of a third type of psychological contract, which we term “Alienational”. Whereas SDG 8 is premised on strengthening relational contracts between an organization and its employees, the adoption of AI has the opposite effect, detracting from the very nature of decent work.",10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.08.018,"Braganza, Ashley; Chen, Weifeng; Canhoto, Ana; Sap, Serap"

Viewpoint: Aligning vision and reality in publicly funded agricultural research for development: A case study of CGIAR,2022,0,Topic_0_agriculture_agricultural_food,0.7827644078109507,"Global food systems are currently facing unprecedented challenges with respect to production and nutritional targets, inclusivity and environmental footprint. Several recent reports highlight the need for major, rapid reconfiguration of our food systems as a result. International publicly funded agricultural research for development will play an increasingly vital role in support of such goals as reducing poverty, improving food and nutrition security, and improving natural resources and ecosystem services. Here we take stock of the work over the last decade of CGIAR, one of the major players in the agricultural research for development arena, from the perspective of published, peer-reviewed science. We do this with respect to several elements of its vision as set out in 2011, elements that are shared by many other organisations that are also working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, we found a strong association between number of CGIAR publications and countries with large numbers of rural poor and high child stunting prevalence. At the same time several countries were identified that are anomalous, being either relatively over- or under-represented in the peer-reviewed literature in relation to numbers of rural poor and stunting prevalence. On average, 30% of the calories consumed in national food baskets come from food sources that are not currently the commodity focus of CGIAR research, such as fruit and vegetables. We identify possible ways in which the alignment between the strategic objectives of an agricultural research for development organisation such as CGIAR and its publicly funded science outputs might be further strengthened, for maximum impact in the nine years that are left for the world to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.",10.1016/j.foodpol.2021.102196,"Thornton, Philip; Dijkman, Jeroen; Herrero, Mario; Szilagyi, Lili; Cramer, Laura"
"How do policy instruments generate new ones? Analysing policy instruments feedback and interaction in educational research in England, 1986-2014",2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.33202319647574585,"The study of research funding arrangements and the production of scientific knowledge has been marked by a lack of understanding about how research funding instruments interact and how these instruments shape policy-making and research fields. To fill this research gap, this study is theoretically supported by policy feedback and policy instruments’ interaction studies. It investigates the effects of the UK's research assessment exercise in the creation of the most emblematic national thematic research program for the field of educational research in the country – the Teaching and Learning Research Programme (TLRP). Based on qualitative analysis of policy documents and semi-structured interviews with policy-makers and boundary-spanners, this paper shows how the research assessment exercise contributed to the creation of the TLRP and how the interaction between the two policy instruments shaped the field of educational research in England. In particular, the results show a) how the institutionalisation of the research assessment led to frame a “quality problem” in educational research that legitimated several policy initiatives, including the creation of the national thematic research programme (interpretative effects) and a shift in resources allocation (resource/incentive effects); and b) how the interaction between the two policy instruments contributed to methodological and epistemic drifts in the field of educational research.",10.1016/j.respol.2021.104367,"Marques, Marcelo"
Blockchain technology for a sustainable agri-food supply chain,2021,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Purpose The present paper is aimed at 1) performing a systematic literature review (SLR) on applications in the perspective of sustainable agri-food supply chain (SC) of blockchain technology (BCT); 2) analyzing the selected literature, focusing on the advantages of the sustainable uses of the blockchain of the aforementioned SC and 3) presenting an outlook and research directions capable of addressing unresolved problems. Design/methodology/approach The SLR was conducted using detailed criteria to identify academic articles. Moreover, specific keywords and databases were used. The time frame considered included the years 2010–2020. Findings The review analysis indicates that the use of BCT or BCT supported by ICT/IoT contributes to sustainability of agri-food production. However, this technology can lead to several challenges such as scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and connectivity problems. Research limitations/implications The paper demonstrates that BCT can widely use agri-food supply chain due to its intrinsic characteristics. However, it is not excluded that the criteria chosen may not have identified important articles regarding BCT, the agri-food sector and sustainability. Originality/value Although the body of academic literature published on this topic is expansive, the effect of BCT on the agri-food SC's sustainability aspects has not yet been adequately analyzed. Thus, the article is aimed at investigating how BCT is used in the SC. In particular, the article is intended to update information about BCT and its impact on sustainability.",10.1108/BFJ-09-2020-0832,"Rana, Roberto Leonardo; Tricase, Caterina; De Cesare, Luigi"
Developing SPIM-TA: a maturity-level framework for systematic process improvement in software testing automation,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8330900307584598,"The growing complexity and demands for high-quality software underlined the need for robust automated software testing frameworks. However, lack of skilled personnel, cost of testing automation, and maintenance of script along with others oppose the widespread adoption of automation in testing. The work proposed by this study is in line with the development of Systematic Process Improvement Model for Testing Automation, abbreviated as SPIM-TA. The model is inspired from Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Software Outsourcing Vendor Readiness Model (SOVRM) maturity-level-based framework. The research was done based on a four-phased methodology. In the first phase, a systematic literature review identified 14 critical challenges in software testing automation with practices or solutions for each of these challenges. In the second round, a survey questionnaire is used to validate these findings in industrial context and extract more practical insights from case studies. This dual approach had ensured both academic rigor and the relevance of the practices with industry. The third one involved developing SPIM-TA by incorporating insights that come from the SLR and those results of the survey as well. The framework defines five maturity levels, systematically addressing the identified challenges and providing a structured pathway for organizations to enhance their automation processes. In the fourth phase, case studies of industrial applications were carried out to evaluate SPIM-TA’s efficiency. The applicability, scalability, and impact of the framework on testing automation in the real world were assessed using the Motorola Assessment Tool. The findings illustrate the systematic way SPIM-TA will help overcome the automation challenge, so that organizations can reach more advanced levels of maturity and efficiency in their testing processes. In the first place, the present study closes the gap between academia and industry but at the same time paves the foundation for future research into the automation of software testing.",10.1016/j.asej.2025.103472,"Abrar, Muhammad Faisal; Alharbi, Yasser; Alsaffar, Muhammad; Hussain, Shah; Saqib, Muhammad; Khan, Jawad; Lee, Youngmoon"

Cloud computing assurance – a review of literature guidance,2017,-1,Outliers,0.10134158530247267,"Purpose This paper aims to provide guidance on cloud computing assurance from an IT governance point of view. The board and executive management are tasked with ensuring proper governance of organizations, which should in the end contribute to a sense of assurance. Assurance is understood to be a part of corporate governance which provides stakeholders with confidence in a subject matter by evaluating evidence about that subject matter. Evidence will include proof that proper controls and structures are in place, that risks are managed and that compliance with internal and external requirements is demonstrated with regard to the subject matter. Decisions regarding the use of cloud computing in organizations bring these responsibilities to the fore. Design/methodology/approach The design of this paper is based on an extensive review of literature, predominantly best practices and standards, from the fields covering IT governance, cloud computing and assurance. Findings The results from this paper can be used to formulate cloud computing assurance evidence statements, as part of IT governance mandates. Originality/value This paper aims to add value by highlighting the responsibility of managers to ensure assurance when exploiting opportunities presented through IT advances, such as cloud computing; serving to inform management about the advances that have and are being made in the field of cloud computing guidelines; and motivating that these guidelines be used for assurance on behalf of organizations adopting and using cloud computing.",10.1108/ICS-09-2015-0037,"von Solms, Rossouw; Willett, Melanie"
Improving sustainability in the tourism industry through blockchain technology: Challenges and opportunities,2022,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"The tourism industry is extremely important to the world economy; yet, the industry falls short when it comes to economic, social, and environmental issues. Blockchain as an information technology can be utilized to help solve these issues and establish sustainable tourism globally. However, the challenges to blockchain adoption in the tourism industry have not yet been examined systematically. The goal of this study, therefore, is three-fold: we first identify the challenges to blockchain using literature review and expert opinions. Then, we examine them using the proposed rough Interpretive Structural Modeling - Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication based on expert judgments. Finally, we link these challenges to diffusion of innovation theory. The results suggest that “lack of technical maturity” and “lack of interoperability” are the most important challenges of blockchain in the tourism industry.

The impact of digital transformation on supply chains through e-commerce: Literature review and a conceptual framework,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"One of the profound impacts of digitalization on supply chains is manifested through e-commerce. The latter has significantly grown during the last two decades, with further amplifications during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created operational and policy making challenges for firms when deciding about how best to manage the resulting growth in e-commerce. While the impact of e-commerce on supply chains has been widely recognized in the literature, there was no effort to systematically review the literature, conceptualize some of the challenges and propose future research directions. This paper fills this gap by reviewing 153 publications from 1999 to 2019. We classify the reviewed literature based on which supply chain drivers were investigated, as well as, the employed research methodology. In addition, we conduct network and content analysis to uncover the main research themes and potential research directions namely, developing analytical centred; modelling based ecosystem for environment; leveraging data mining to enhance sustainability; balance between growth and sustainability; consumer demand and uncertainty; coordination in e-commerce logistics; last mile alternatives and cost management of innovative technique implementations.

Assessing the dynamic social values of the ‘deep city’: An integrated methodology combining online and offline approaches,2024,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,1.0,"This monograph presents findings from original research on urban heritage transformations and advances existing scholarship on three grounds: (1) it offers tested combinations of methods to capture the social values of heritage; (2) it distils the complex, diverse social values generated by urban heritage and revealed by the use of these methods; and (3) it discusses the implications and potential applications of these methods for urban planning. Cities are multi-layered deposits of tangible historic features and intangible meanings, memories, practices and associated values. These dense socio-material assemblages have been conceptualised as the ‘deep city’, a concept that recognises dynamic relationships between past, present and future, whilst simultaneously repositioning heritage at the heart of sustainable transformation. However, methods for understanding people’s relationships with urban heritage are mostly applied piecemeal in urban planning and heritage management. Here, we introduce research involving a suite of social and digital research methods, which can be deployed rapidly in online and offline spaces to examine the social values generated by urban heritage. Three in-depth case studies, in Edinburgh, London, and Florence, reveal how these values are involved in urban place-making. Failure to take them into account in development and regeneration projects can result in fragmentation and/or marginalisation of communities and their place attachments.

Value capture and embeddedness in social-purpose-driven ecosystems. A multiple-case study of European digital healthcare platforms,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.47088997151917755,"We aim to answer the question of the effect of a social-purpose-driven ecosystem on value capture from digital health platforms. We call the social-purpose-driven ecosystem a phenomenon which seeks social impact before profits and aims to empower citizens for individual and collective well-being. Thus, capturing value from digital platforms embedded in a social-purpose-driven ecosystem fundamentally differs from profiting from purely commercial digital platforms and poses significant challenges to platform owners and public policy. Previous research has focused mainly on profiting from technological innovations but has yet to consider the contextual role of the social-purpose-driven ecosystem. We applied the Profiting from Innovation (PFI) framework to fill this gap. Furthermore, based on the results of the multiple-case study of five European digital healthcare platforms, we extend the PFI framework. As a result, we define four unique contingencies which enable value capture from digital healthcare platforms embedded in a social-purpose-driven ecosystem: 1) multilayer value creation, (2) multipurpose complementary assets, (3) emerging dominant design, and (4) distributed socio-economic returns mechanisms. The study offers two managerial and policy contributions. First, it calls on platform owners and policymakers to acknowledge the contextual effect of a social-purpose-driven ecosystem. Second, multilayer value creation, multiple complementary assets, dominant design and distributed socio-economic returns mechanisms can positively affect capturing value from digital healthcare platforms.",10.1016/j.technovation.2023.102748,"Pundziene, Asta; Gerulaitiene, Neringa; Bez, Sea Matilda; Georgescu, Irène; Mathieu, Christopher; Carrabina-Bordoll, Jordi; Rialp-Criado, Josep; Nieminen, Hannu; Varri, Alpo; Boethius, Susanne; van Gils, Mark; Giménez-Garcia, Víctor; Narbón-Perpiñá, Isabel; Prior-Jiménez, Diego; Vilutiene, Laura"
You can’t govern if you don’t measure,2019,-1,Outliers,0.08690751262448097,"Purpose The purpose of the study is to verify the theoretical assumptions based on literature review regarding the issue of brand effectiveness evaluation and the potential measurement framework, as well as to provide insights into the nature of effectiveness measurement of city brand strategies. The findings are considered important foundations for designing a place branding measurement system, which is the next step and final purpose of the author’s research project. Design/methodology/approach A total of 12 international academic experts from eight countries (in four continents) were individually interviewed. A semi-structured individual interview was applied as a research method. Sampling was purposive and the respondents represented the fields of marketing, place branding and public management. The standardized set of 19 open-ended questions was categorized into four themes (city brand effectiveness, methodology, measurement process and indicators). Findings The measurement of effectiveness of city branding should be treated as a strategic endeavor; however, it is a complex issue where political, social and methodological challenges overlap. Barriers to the development of a well-functioning measurement system include: too narrow understanding of what brand is, lack of knowledge or culture of measurement, conflicting political interests, reluctance to involve internal stakeholders, insufficient funding and complexity of the brand itself. The reliable measurement system should be characterized by attributes such as simplicity and durability, stakeholder inclusion, political rationale, adjustment to the specificity of the city and the independence of the measuring body/institution. Originality/value Up-to-date, common standards or universal measurement frames of the place branding measurement system do not exist. No discussion can be found in the literature on how such a system should be designed and implemented. Opinions of the experts interviewed provide important insights into the components and conditions of the reliable measurement system that would meet both methodological standards and practical needs.

Natural resources tax volatility and economic performance: Evaluating the role of digital economy,2022,-1,Outliers,0.07494219282611299,"The existing literature lacks empirical nexus of natural resources tax (TNRT) volatility and economic performance. Also, the digital economy is currently a hot issue among researchers and policy-makers. Therefore, the current study investigates TNRT volatility and economic performance – while adopting the role of digital economy (DEE), financial development (FD), technological innovation (TI), research and development expenditures (RDE). This study examines 30 Chinese provinces covering the period from 2006 to 2017. Using the panel quantile regression, this study explores that TNRT volatility, DEE, FD, and TI significantly increase economic performance in all the quantiles (Q0.25, Q0.50, Q0.75).

Toward a conceptual framework of health crisis information needs: an analysis of COVID-19 questions in a Chinese social Q&A website,2021,-1,Outliers,0.1914137666004466,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand how the contextual factors of health crisis information needs are different from a general health context and how these factors work together to shape human information needs. Design/methodology/approach This study collected the COVID-19-related questions posted on a Chinese social Q&A website for a period of 90 days since the pandemic outbreak in China. A qualitative thematic approach was applied to analyze the 1,681 valid questions using an open coding process. Findings A taxonomy of information need topics for a health crisis context that identifies 8 main categories and 33 subcategories was developed, from which four overarching themes were extracted. These include understanding, clarification and preparation; affection expression of worries and confidence; coping with a challenging situation and resuming normal life; and social roles in the pandemic. The authors discussed the differences between a health crisis and a normal health context shaping information needs. Finally, a conceptual framework was developed to illustrate the typology, nature and triggers of health crisis information needs. Research limitations/implications First, only the Baidu Zhidao platform was investigated, and caution is advised before assuming the generalizability of the results, as the questioners of Baidu Zhidao are not representative of the whole population. Furthermore, since at the time of writing the COVID-19 is still in an emerging and evolving situation (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020), the collected data included only a relatively small sample size compared to the post-pandemic period, and this might have impact on the interpretation of the study’s findings. Practical implications The study’s taxonomy of information needs provides a reference for indexing and organizing related information during a disaster. Social implications The study helps authoritative organizations track and send information in social media and to inform about policies related to the pandemic (e.g., quarantine and traffic control policies in our study) to the right people in the right regions and settings when the next disaster emerges.

EU GDPR or APEC CBPR? A comparative analysis of the approach of the EU and APEC to cross border data transfers and protection of personal data in the IoT era,2019,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"This article examines the two major international data transfer schemes in existence today – the European Union (EU) model which at present is effectively the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules system (CBPR), in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). While IoT data ostensibly relates to things i.e. products and services, it impacts individuals and their data protection and privacy rights, and raises compliance issues for corporations especially in relation to international data flows. The GDPR regulates the processing of personal data of individuals who are EU data subjects including cross border data transfers. As an EU Regulation, the GDPR applies directly as law to EU member nations. The GDPR also has extensive extraterritorial provisions that apply to processing of personal data outside the EU regardless of place of incorporation and geographical area of operation of the data controller/ processor. There are a number of ways that the GDPR enables lawful international transfer of personal data including schemes that are broadly similar to APEC CBPR. APEC CBPR is the other major regional framework regulating transfer of personal data between APEC member nations. It is essentially a voluntary accountability scheme that initially requires acceptance at country level, followed by independent certification by an accountability agent of the organization wishing to join the scheme. APEC CBPR is viewed by many in the United States of America (US) as preferable to the EU approach because CBPR is considered more conducive to business than its counterpart schemes under the GDPR, and therefore is regarded as the scheme most likely to prevail. While there are broad areas of similarity between the EU and APEC approaches to data protection in the context of cross border data transfer, there are also substantial differences. This paper considers the similarities and major differences, and the overall suitability of the two models for the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) in which large amounts of personal data are processed on an on-going basis from connected devices around the world. This is the first time the APEC and GDPR cross-border data schemes have been compared in this way. The paper concludes with the author expressing a view as to which scheme is likely to set the global standard.",10.1016/j.clsr.2019.05.004,"Sullivan, Clare"

Exploring perceptions of decision-makers and specialists in defensive machine learning cybersecurity applications: The need for a standardised approach,2024,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,1.0,"Machine learning (ML) utilisation has achieved a vast global impact. This is evident in the cybersecurity sector, where ML has wide-ranging applications, such as identifying and blocking threats, uncovering unusual software and user behaviour, and many others. However, the increase in successful cyberattacks demonstrates that the effectiveness of ML in cybersecurity applications can be questioned. Although the attacks may be new, ML is often adopted due to its ability to handle diverse and often unforeseen situations – a capability that is not possible using traditional rule-based security mechanisms. As both the rate of attacks and adoption of ML solutions are increasing, there is a need to determine whether ML-based security solutions are meeting the expectations of businesses and whether businesses are genuinely aware of the ML capabilities and limitations. Moreover, current literature shows a significant variation in how ML solutions are evaluated in cybersecurity applications, which might result in a poor understanding of ML capabilities. This paper explores the common perceptions and observations of decision-makers and specialists using ML for cybersecurity regarding its capabilities, implementation, evaluation, and communication. A semi-structured interview is conducted with individuals in various managerial positions to perform this investigation. The finding of this study reveals a pressing need for a standard to manifest ML capabilities. As significant variation in the understanding of Machine Learning Cyber Security (MLCS) capabilities is observed, a standard could help better communicate MLCS capabilities.

Efforts to improve this condition are hindered by three challenges Local authorities implement restrictive measures, which do not fully take account of the interests of all stakeholders. sufficiently into account. As the demand for goods in urban areas increases further in the future, solutions are necessary. At the same time, many vehicles are inefficiently loaded, leading to the unnecessary presence of freight vehicles. In this paper, we propose a new classification of innovative concepts for sustainable city distribution called the 4 A's, which take into account these challenges. The 4 A's stand for Awareness, Avoidance, Act and shift, and Anticipation of new technologies. These concepts can be implemented by the one responsible for city distribution—the private sector. For each ‘A,’ an overview of possible concepts, and the most important characteristics and the gaps in the research are provided. Stakeholder involvement is stressed as the key and methods to involve multiple stakeholders are provided. By starting from this perspective and focusing additionally on other stakeholders, the likelihood that a concept becomes successful increases.",10.1080/15568318.2016.1196404,"Macharis, Cathy; Kin, Bram"
Mapping sustainability reporting research with the UN's sustainable development goal,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.3841281202139182,"Non-financial reporting (NFR) has become crucial to corporate sustainability strategies as companies demonstrate their commitment to the environmental, social, and governance actions outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Agenda 2030. Among the various mandatory NFR initiatives, Sustainability Reporting (SR) has emerged as a widely adopted practice by companies worldwide. A gap that the study addresses is the theoretical perspectives on SR in the context of SDG. Then we conduct a bibliometric and science mapping analysis of research trends on SR and precisely map SR research to SDGs which is also a gap in the current literature. We find an exponential increase in the number of publications and citations on SR, particularly after 2015, which coincides with increased public awareness and scrutiny of the SDGs. At the country level, Australia leads with a total of 13 SDGs, followed by the UK, Spain, and Italy, which each address 12 SDGs. Emerging economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and India have also increased their contributions since 2019. A keyword co-occurrence analysis identified three main clusters: stakeholder engagement, corporate governance, and accountability; sustainable development goals and climate change; and sustainability reporting and global reporting initiatives. All three clusters had highly cited publications related to SDG 8 (decent work), SDG 9 (industry innovation), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption). This highlights the interdisciplinary nature of SR and its relevance to multiple SDGs. The study is distinctive in that we utilized social network analysis to examine the SDG network based on SR publications, which also affirmed the centrality of SDG 9 and 12. We utilized the prominence percentile, which indicates the momentum of a particular topic, to identify future topics in SR that align with the SDGs. These include cause-related marketing, environmentally preferable purchasing decisions, environmental management systems, education for sustainability, and green computing.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e18510,"Raman, Raghu; Nair, Vinith Kumar; Shivdas, Avinash; Bhukya, Ramulu; Viswanathan, P.K.; Subramaniam, Nava; Nedungadi, Prema"
The effectiveness of performance-based contracting in the defence sector: A systematic literature review,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Performance-based contracting in the defence sector, also known as performance-based logistics (PBL), is attracting growing interest from operations and supply management scholars. In the defence sector, PBL entails outsourcing weapon system-related maintenance and logistics activities in such a way that it incentivises suppliers to invest in equipment reliability and process improvements at a reasonable cost. Research has advanced our knowledge of how PBL contracts are designed and implemented, but we still have only limited understanding of PBL evaluation issues, specifically PBL effectiveness and its influencing factors. Focusing on the defence context, we address this knowledge gap through a systematic literature review and synthesis of 45 peer-reviewed articles. We identify 15 factors influencing PBL effectiveness, which are grouped into six categories: governance, supply chain management, defence buyer input, innovation, environmental factors, and resources and capabilities. We extend prior research by developing a classification framework of the factors influencing PBL effectiveness. Further, we leverage defence industry-specific characteristics to suggest avenues for impactful future research through a series of propositions, including the need to examine how political factors influence the effectiveness of performance-based contracting in the defence sector. We also suggest that environmental sustainability and resilience requirements should be included when evaluating the effectiveness of PBL contracts and defence contracting more generally.",10.1016/j.pursup.2023.100877,"Alqahtani, Faris; Selviaridis, Kostas; Stevenson, Mark"
Constructing blame for school exclusion in an online comments forum: Membership categorisation analysis and endogenous category work,2019,3,Topic_3_social_media_social media,0.39354995058156733,"In this article we use Membership Categorisation Analysis to analyse conversations in an online forum in the British newspaper The Guardian. The comments thread followed an Op Ed piece that discussed the exclusion of ‘under-performing’ children in British secondary schools. Our analysis of these comments contributes to existing studies of online forums as a mode of public discourse and demonstrates the importance of research that focusses on interactional practices rather than on notions such as ‘politeness’ or ‘framing’. We show the ways that participants used endogenous conversational categories to produce epistemic alignment and disalignment with each other, employing various strategies such as expanding category collections, creating relations between ‘culpable’ categories and ‘trouble’ categories, and re-describing categories through alternate category predicates. Through this, we see that the conversational actions undertaken in the forum are much more complicated than current concepts allow for, and we reflect on what such complexity might mean for the study and design of news forums.",10.1016/j.dcm.2019.100331,"Gibson, Will; Roca-Cuberes, Carles"

Designed to provide human-like service, ICAs are generally evaluated by users in comparison to their human counterparts, often resulting in less-than-expected user experiences. Our research investigates user acceptance of ICAs in this suboptimal condition of commercial customer service. Drawing from the dual perspectives of expectancy confirmation theory and task technology fit theory, we theorize and test an integrated research model on the collective impact of user expectancy confirmation regarding ICA capabilities and their assessment of service-ICA fit on user acceptance. Results from a field survey of 350 users of five ICAs deployed by major Canadian telecom service providers reveal the significant influence of both user expectancy confirmation with ICA capabilities and their assessment of ICA fit-to-service, with the latter playing a more prominent role in shaping user acceptance. Even though ICA performance may not always meet user expectations, users are still willing to engage with ICA services when they perceive the ICA as a fitting solution for their specific service complexity and availability requirements.",10.1016/j.im.2024.104033,"Sohail, Maarif; Wang, Fang; Archer, Norm; Wang, Wenting; Yuan, Yufei"

We first carry out a descriptive analysis, with results showing that modern slavery research is on an upward trajectory but suffers from a lack of primary data and theory application. We then extract themes from the published articles and use them to provide theory elaboration of Gold et al. (2015) model of modern slavery in SCM. Specifically, we introduce business culture and high impact risk factors like pandemics as new institutional factors; highlight external stakeholders like recruitment agents and audit firms as integral to understanding the business context of modern slavery; and add prevention and remediation to detection and response as discrete categories in managing modern slavery risks. We also discuss the gaps in modern slavery research in supply chains.

Systematic construction of lawfulness of processing employees’ personal information under China's personal information protection law,2023,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"With the rapid development and widespread use of digital technologies in the workplace in China, employers’ right to monitor and direct employees has often been abused, raising a number of disputes over the infringement of employees’ right to privacy in terms of their personal information. China must urgently develop an appropriate approach to balancing these two conflicting interests. However, there is currently no coherent and uniform regime governing the protection of employees’ personal information in China. The primary legal source on which employers can rely is the latest version of the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which offers three lawful bases for employers’ processing of their employees’ personal information. These bases are employee consent; “necessity for the conclusion or performance of an employment contract”; and “necessity for conducting human resource management.” Concerns have been expressed regarding the reasonableness and effectiveness of the three lawful bases under the PIPL. First, it is both legally and practically problematic for the PIPL to rely so heavily on employee consent. Second, it is unclear whether the other two lawful bases relieve employers of the duty of notification and, if so, how to safeguard employees’ right to know. Third, the ambiguous standard of “necessity” requires clarification. This article argues that China should adopt many elements from EU law, while US law should be only followed in relation to the standard of “necessity”. In relation to employee consent, the EU approach is preferable to the US approach. As the EU approach does not generally regard employees’ consent as a lawful basis for the processing of their information and uses the other two lawful bases as alternatives to employee consent, this approach better reflects the customary practices of employee subordination and employer control in China. In contrast, US law deems employee consent to be an absolute general defense to the tort of privacy violation and adopts an employer favoritism approach to balancing these two conflicting interests, which is not appropriate in the Chinese context. In relation to the scope of necessity, three tests taken from the EU and US approaches should be considered by the Chinese courts. In addition, when processing personal information based on the other two lawful bases, employers should safeguard employees’ right to know through collective contracts concluded with labor unions or employee representatives under the Chinese Labor Contract Law, which would effectively address employers’ arbitrariness. Ultimately, these changes would produce a better balance between employees’ right to privacy in terms of their personal information and employers’ need to subordinate and control employees.",10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105853,"Zhang, Zhenxing; Zha, Yunfei"
Disruptions in the food supply chain: A literature review,2024,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7932421911039004,"Disruptions in the food supply chain are events that affect the flow of products and can be caused by extreme weather, natural disasters, conflicts, pandemics, and political situations, among others. These events can significantly impact food products' availability, quality, and cost, creating risks to the well-being of local populations and livelihoods. The specific literature on food supply chains needs to address other approaches to risk categorisation, which allow for establishing reference frameworks focused on the general classification of types of disruption and parameters related to solution methods. In this paper, we present a literature review to analyse the disruptions in the food supply chain. We classified 74 papers according to the types of disruptions, stakeholders, response level, supply chain echelon, solution methods, goals, and related considerations. The review results showed that the most common disruptions in the food supply chain are climatic, biological and environmental, logistics and infrastructure, and supply.

Automated administrative decision-making under the influence of the GDPR – Early reflections and upcoming challenges,2021,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"This article examines the intersection of the GDPR and selected due process requirements in the context of automated administrative decision-making. It finds that the safeguards for decisions based solely on automated data processing provided by the GDPR coincide with or serve a comparable function to traditional administrative due process elements such as the duty to give reasons, the duty of care principle, and the right to a hearing. The automation of decision-making by public authorities across the EU will therefore be regulated by an overlap of national administrative procedures and the GDPR. This overlap, however, leads to a paradoxical problem: on the one hand, the GDPR is an inflexible legal instrument aimed at setting out in detail the rights of data subjects and the obligations of data controllers, and it does not offer national legislators much room to align its terms with national administrative procedures. On the other, the GDPR's broad language makes it susceptible to interpretations embedded in the elaborated practices of the national administrations. The unclear relationship between national administrative procedures and the GDPR may undermine its main purpose – to establish an equal level of protection in all EU Member States through its ‘consistent and homogenous application’. After outlining the main challenges in this regard, the article concludes with a call for further research and regulatory frameworks adjustments aimed at developing a better governance regime for automated administrative decision-making that would allow for embracing technological progress while keeping threats to individual rights in check.",10.1016/j.clsr.2021.105538,"Geburczyk, Filip"

Previous research has examined the status of the academic study of tourism in disciplinary terms and the epistemological basis of knowledge production, yet very little examination of the conceptual structure of tourism has been undertaken. This conceptual article examines the presence of theory of tourism. It presents evidence, via the use of case study vignettes, of examples of theory/theorizing at the meta-, middle range and micro-levels. It articulates guidelines for theorising tourism and principles for developing a theoretical contribution to knowledge, critical to Annals of Tourism Research, whose mission is to advance knowledge of tourism phenomena at the conceptual level that can lead to progress in theory development.",10.1016/j.annals.2023.103721,"McCabe, Scott"
Exploration on the spatial spillover effect of infrastructure network on urbanization: A case study in Wuhan urban agglomeration,2019,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7707286160284331,"In the context of rapid urbanization, the rational spatial distribution of infrastructures, such as road network and public facilities is of great importance for the spatial optimization of infrastructure construction and sustainable regional development. In this study, we explored the spatial spillover influence of infrastructure network on urbanization in road network-based and POI-based hypotheses through spatial modeling in Wuhan urban agglomeration in 2005 and 2015. The global integration values of the road axial lines and Points of Interest (POI) density were used to generate spatial weight matrices by the gravity model to formulate the two hypotheses. The results revealed that local economic factors and the spatial influence of infrastructure both contribute to the changes in urbanization with varying powers in different hypotheses and years. In general, spatial spillover effects from neighbors in the form of road network and point-based facilities have weakened in recent years. However, the comparative magnitude has changed from road network dominated to similar functioning between road network and POI based facilities. It is concluded that the rational utilization of the embedded spatial spillover effect helps to formulate strategies for sustainable urbanization in improving resource use efficiency, achieving balanced development and promoting an integrated urban–rural development.",10.1016/j.scs.2019.101476,"Zeng, Chen; Song, Yan; Cai, Dawei; Hu, Peiying; Cui, Huatai; Yang, Jing; Zhang, Hongxia"
Posthumanism and Design,2017,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Since at least the mid-1980s, design has been dominated by a human-centered and user-centered paradigm. Currently, the implications of technological and environmental transformations are challenging designers to focus on complex socio-technical systems. This article traces emergent discussions around posthumanism from across a range of disciplines and perspectives, and considers examples from emerging design practices that emphasize the interrelations between human and nonhuman actors. Specifically, this article reviews literature from actor-network theory (ANT), feminist new materialism, object-oriented ontology, non-representational theory, and transhumanism to inform the development of new methodologies and practices in the field of design. Finally, this article presents critiques of posthumanism from critical race theory and decolonial theory to consider how emergent design perspectives might better support values such as equality and justice for humans and nonhumans that have been traditionally ignored in design processes.",10.1016/j.sheji.2017.08.001,"Forlano, Laura"
The emergence and evolution of benchmarking: a management fashion perspective,2017,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to make a contribution to the benchmarking literature by examining the historical emergence and evolution of benchmarking using the management fashion perspective as a theoretical lens. Design/methodology/approach The research approach followed in this paper can be characterized as explorative and theoretical. Insights from different data sources have been combined to provide a rich description of the emergence and evolution of benchmarking. Findings This analysis casts new light on several aspects of benchmarking’s emergence and evolution pattern. The characteristics of the benchmarking idea give it potential as a fashionable management tool. The widespread popularity and longevity of benchmarking can to a large extent be explained by the efforts of various actors to turn benchmarking into an institution. Research limitations/implications The paper is explorative and is limited by a reliance on secondary sources. Originality/value Although some researchers have noted that benchmarking could be viewed as a management fashion, management fashion theory has, only to a very limited extent, been used as a theoretical lens in the context of benchmarking. This research paper demonstrates that management fashion theory can provide valuable insights for research on benchmarking.",10.1108/BIJ-05-2016-0077,"Madsen, Dag Øivind; Slåtten, Kåre; Johanson, Daniel"
"Opinion Paper: “So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy",2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8143900220519489,"Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.",10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2023.102642,"Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Kshetri, Nir; Hughes, Laurie; Slade, Emma Louise; Jeyaraj, Anand; Kar, Arpan Kumar; Baabdullah, Abdullah M.; Koohang, Alex; Raghavan, Vishnupriya; Ahuja, Manju; Albanna, Hanaa; Albashrawi, Mousa Ahmad; Al-Busaidi, Adil S.; Balakrishnan, Janarthanan; Barlette, Yves; Basu, Sriparna; Bose, Indranil; Brooks, Laurence; Buhalis, Dimitrios; Carter, Lemuria; Chowdhury, Soumyadeb; Crick, Tom; Cunningham, Scott W.; Davies, Gareth H.; Davison, Robert M.; Dé, Rahul; Dennehy, Denis; Duan, Yanqing; Dubey, Rameshwar; Dwivedi, Rohita; Edwards, John S.; Flavián, Carlos; Gauld, Robin; Grover, Varun; Hu, Mei-Chih; Janssen, Marijn; Jones, Paul; Junglas, Iris; Khorana, Sangeeta; Kraus, Sascha; Larsen, Kai R.; Latreille, Paul; Laumer, Sven; Malik, F.

Beyond the Golden Era of public health: charting a path from sanitarianism to ecological public health,2015,-1,Outliers,0.15806209783986647,"The paper considers the long-term trajectory of public health and whether a ‘Golden Era’ in Public Health might be coming to an end. While successful elements of the 20th century policy approach need still to be applied in the developing world, two significant flaws are now apparent within its core thinking. It assumes that continuing economic growth will generate sufficient wealth to pay for the public health infrastructure and improvement needed in the 21st century when, in reality, externalised costs are spiralling. Secondly, there is evidence of growing mismatch between ecosystems and human progress. While 20th century development has undeniably improved public health, it has also undermined the capacity to maintain life on a sustainable basis and has generated other more negative health consequences. For these and other reasons a rethink about the role, purpose and direction of public health is needed. While health has to be at the heart of any viable notion of progress the dominant policy path offers new versions of the ‘health follows wealth’ position. The paper posits ecological public health as a radical project to reshape the conditions of existence. Both of these broad paths require different functions and purposes from their institutions, professions and politicians. The paper suggests that eco-systems pressures, including climate change, are already adding to pressure for a change of course.",10.1016/j.puhe.2015.07.042,"Lang, Tim; Rayner, Geof"

With the objective to assess the quality and adoptability of education supply chain, a novel analytical evaluation model approach is proposed, based on quality function deployment and combinative distance-based assessment. To deal with uncertainty in the evaluation process, fuzzy theory is integrated into the model. To establish the house of quality matrix, technology-based stakeholders' requirements were identified and classified in four dimensions: economic and financial, technology adoption, sustainability, competencies. Moreover, nine supplier criteria were assumed. Based on expert evaluations, the results suggest that financial credit and supplier collaboration are the most prominent attributes to evaluate suppliers, while environmental commitment is sorted as the least important criterion.

It makes a case for diversity, including a broad range of theories and research methodologies, as a defining feature of AAAJ. As we have done since 1988 in AAAJ’s first editorial, we continue to urge interdisciplinary accounting researchers to undertake innovative research and be both original and creative, avoiding the narrow focus and detachment from society that is characteristic of globally pervasive North American economics-based accounting research. Design/methodology/approach The paper employs an analysis and critique of trends in interdisciplinary research, drawing upon the previous 29 editorials/commentaries published in AAAJ. It also elucidates the field of scholarship associated with AAAJ in 2016 as evidence of the patterning of recent research and publishing trends. Findings This paper identifies challenges confronting interdisciplinary researchers in the globalised academic community. These include our obsession with theoretical engorgement and our adversarial rather than cooperative approach to knowledge development. Furthermore, the authors argue that researchers must reflect on their motivation, informing theories and values if they intend to contribute to practice, policy and a wider societal good. Accounting researchers have a responsibility to go beyond observation, engaging in and constructing a more equal and fair society.

Exploring accounting and AI using topic modelling,2024,-1,Outliers,0.10134982684180295,"Historically, literature suggests that a variety of accounting roles will be replaced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies; however, in recent years there is a growing recognition that accounting can in fact harness AI’s potential to add value to organisations. Commentators have highlighted the need for increased research exploring accounting and AI and for accounting scholars to consider multi-disciplinary research in this area. This study uses a form of topic modelling to analyse literature exploring AI and related techniques in an accounting context. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been used to enable probabilistic, machine-based interrogation of large volumes of literature. This study applies LDA to the abstracts of 930 peer-reviewed academic publications from a variety of disciplines to identify the most significant accounting and AI topics discussed in the literature during the period 1990 to 2023. Our findings suggest that prior literature reviews based on more traditional methodologies do not capture a comprehensive picture of accounting and AI research. Eleven topic clusters are identified which provide a comprehensive topology of the extant literature discussing accounting and AI and set out an agenda for future research designed to foster academic progress in the area. It also represents one of the first applications of probabilistic topic modelling to accounting literature.",10.1016/j.accinf.2024.100709,"Murphy, Brid; Feeney, Orla; Rosati, Pierangelo; Lynn, Theo"

Protection path of personal data and privacy in China: Moving from monism to dualism in civil law and then in criminal law,2024,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"The relationship between privacy protection and personal data protection is legally and academically challenging. The PRC's civil law has evolved from the traditional monism of privacy right provision (protecting personal information) to the dualism of separating privacy protection and personal information protection. But when the private information within the privacy sphere involves personal information, the dualism protection is not absolute, but more delicate than it has been suggested. More importantly, there is little in the existing literature analysing the noteworthy divergence of the protection path of privacy and personal information in civil law and criminal law – or considering the reasonable convergence of the protection path under the civil and criminal law. China's Criminal Law has sought to protect privacy with personal information provision for more than a decade. But it is presently difficult to convert privacy content into private information for personal information protection purposes. Given the multifaceted forms of contemporary privacy invasion and comparative law trends and thoughts, we seek to build a protection framework for privacy in the information age under the criminal law – and continually updating it – so as to make use of the expression function of coherence law theory to nurture a culture of respecting individual privacy and trusting legal protection in the information technology environment. The eventual convergence of dualism protection of personal data and privacy in both civil law and criminal law corresponds to the doctrinal coherence in the information age and to policy considerations in the digital economy and society. Privacy is by default an inalienable right to protect dignity and liberty – while personal information can be a comprehensive interest, which values and balances security and purpose, in accordance with law, in a specific jurisdiction such as contemporary China. The dualism exemplifies criminal law's coordination with civil law in protection.",10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105928,"Guo, Zhilong; Hao, Jie; Kennedy, Lewis"
Beyond the Technology Pork Barrel?

After reviewing the rationales for conducting such projects and providing partial public funding for them, five assessment criteria derived from the literature are applied to the portfolio, pertaining to project selection and termination, cost-sharing, partnerships, information-sharing, and the environment for follow-on investment. The assessment is mixed. DOE performed best, relative to expectations, on project selection and termination and partnerships, and not as well on cost-sharing, information-sharing, and the follow-on environment. This performance does not warrant establishing a new agency to replace DOE for management of demonstration projects. The recommendations include implementing cost-sharing more flexibly, making information-sharing a higher priority, avoiding too-rapid scale-up of technologies, and being explicit about project milestones and considering termination if they are not met.",10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.047,"Hart, David M."
Technological progress in the Brazilian agriculture,2020,-1,Outliers,0.20718125265880924,"We analyze technical progress in the Brazilian agriculture in the period 1976–2016. Output is production value and inputs are expenses on land, labor, and other inputs. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) measures are used to capture technological progress via efficiency analysis. Filtering the data with a moving average and fractional regression we identify four periods with distinct behavior of technical efficiency under constant or decreasing returns to scale. From 1976 to 1988 and from 1996 to 2007 technical efficiency decreases at statistically significant rates of −1.74% and −0.26% respectively. From 1989 to 1995 and from 2008 to 2016 efficiency increases at statistically significant rates of 1.53% and 1.75% respectively. Efficiency of input use varies in these periods and is computed as a byproduct of the DEA analysis. We observe a more efficient usage of land and other inputs. A parametric fit using adjusted efficient inputs indicate the relative elasticities of 40.5%, 38.5% and 21.0% for other inputs, land and labor, respectively. Technological progress increases 3.73% in the period 1976–1988, decreases 1,58% between 1989 and 1995, increases 0.17% in the period 1996–2007 and increases 1.01% between 2008 and 2016.

Towards evidence-based management of external resources: Developing design propositions and future research avenues through research synthesis,2017,-1,Outliers,0.12360558300590492,"The general question of how best to access and leverage resources that reside outside the boundaries of the focal firm has become increasingly important for companies during the last decennia, and scholars across management disciplines have responded with increasing research efforts. However, managers still seldom base their decisions on scientific evidence. Research on managing external resources is carried out in disciplinary silos and it is extremely difficult for managers to make sense of the vast amount of scientific studies. The success story of medicine as the first domain to widely adopt evidence-based practices has been an exemplar for other disciplines such as management to address the prevailing research-practice gap. Through a systematic review and synthesis of 601 articles in six academic journals representing three management disciplines we develop design propositions for supporting evidence-based management of external resources in firms. Our analysis reveals external resource management (ERM) research to be concentrated on six distinct, yet interrelated, themes.

Meta-analysis of the strategies for self-healing and resilience in power systems,2021,7,Topic_7_energy_power_data,0.3774725723736363,"This paper presents a survey of the literature on the strategies to enhance the resilience of power systems while shedding lights on the research gaps. Using a deductive methodology on the literature covering the resilience of power systems, we reviewed more than two hundred peer-reviewed articles spanning the 2010–2019 decade. We find that there is vacuum on the level of integration that considers the interdependence of local or decentralized decision making in an adaptive power system. This gap is widened by the absence of policies to enhance resilience in power networks. While there is significant coverage and convergence of research on algorithms for solving the multi-objective problem in optimization routines, there are still uncharted territories on how to incorporate system degradation while designing these self-restoration systems.

Findings The paper makes four main contributions: first, demonstrating how the accounting entity is a changeable and contestable construction; second, outlining how distinctions informing contests about the accounting arena are materialised through accounting calculations and other devices; third, showing the importance of community in a coordinated sense in mediating accounting practices; and fourth, contributing to the literature on accounting and sport, highlighting the importance of state actors in this arena. Originality/value This research draws on original empirical data providing unique insights into debates regarding the responsibility for the payment of police costs in the context of sports-related violence. The authors show the importance of characterising accounting for sporting organisations as a shifting and contestable nexus of market, state and community actors.",10.1108/AAAJ-02-2018-3364,"Baxter, Jane; Carlsson-Wall, Martin; Chua, Wai Fong; Kraus, Kalle"
"Material flow analysis (MFA) as a strategic tool in E-waste management: Applications, trends and future directions",2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Material flow analysis (MFA) is one of the most widely accepted and utilized tools in the industrial-ecology discipline, that measures the input-output materials and examines the pathways and flux of each material flow within the whole system. The application of MFA in e-waste management has recently increased and quite a few academic articles have been published on this issue providing decision support at the policy level. However, there is a need to understand the dynamics of MFA methodology, the data requirements (as well as the data sources used in the previous studies) and the lessons learnt from the studies, so that countries where such an E-waste-MFA study has not yet been performed can apply the international experience of such an emerging research technique. This comprehensive review article presents the recent applications, trends, characteristics, research gaps and challenges of the MFA method that may help e-waste management with an overview of the need for a such tool to be applied. A country-wise analysis is presented and MFA models complemented by various associated methods are summarized with national-level, regional-level, product-level, and element-level assessment. The highlighted future research perspectives discussed in this study will help to analyze e-waste management systems more critically, including the hidden and known flows of waste products and associated materials, economic assessment of material recovery and the role of responsible authorities. This invaluable contribution will help future researchers, particularly from the data collection techniques and previously applied MFA models complemented by various associated methods.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.05.062,"Islam, Md Tasbirul; Huda, Nazmul"
AI system architecture design methodology based on IMO (Input-AI Model-Output) structure for successful AI adoption in organizations,2024,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.537493533863883,"With the advancement of AI technology, the successful AI adoption in organizations has become a top priority in modern society. However, many organizations still struggle to articulate the necessary AI, and AI experts have difficulties understanding the problems faced by these organizations. This knowledge gap makes it difficult for organizations to identify the technical requirements, such as necessary data and algorithms, for adopting AI. To overcome this problem, we propose a new AI system architecture design methodology based on the IMO (Input-AI Model-Output) structure. The IMO structure enables effective identification of the technical requirements necessary to develop real AI models. While previous research has identified the importance and challenges of technical requirements, such as data and AI algorithms, for AI adoption, there has been little research on methodology to concretize them. Our methodology is composed of three stages: problem definition, system AI solution, and AI technical solution to design the AI technology and requirements that organizations need at a system level. The effectiveness of our methodology is demonstrated through a case study, logical comparative analysis with other studies, and experts reviews, which demonstrate that our methodology can support successful AI adoption to organizations.",10.1016/j.datak.2023.102264,"Park, Seungkyu; Lee, Joong yoon; Lee, Jooyeoun"
Belt and road initiative (BRI) supply chain risks: propositions and model development,2020,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Purpose Belt and road initiative (BRI) is a transcontinental endeavor strategically connecting supply chains (SCs) and economic infrastructures to ignite business activities and achieve trade benefits. However, the rising global SC failure costs and risks associated with this initiative (owing to unique geopolitical, economic and mega-connectivity involving over 70 countries) necessitate examining BRI SC risks. Yet, research on the subject remains limited, and the purpose of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge. Design/methodology/approach A two-pronged approach was taken. First, a data sample of 554 articles was analyzed and 178 articles found relevant were used to present a systematic, structured framework of risk factors along operational, economic, financial, social and security dimensions. Then informed by the theory of risk management and supplemented by literature evidence, we have built a BRI SC risk model. Findings The results presented through the model show that BRI SCs face a combination of risks triggered by operational processes, informational and environmental (PIE) deficiencies. Findings show that lack of risk and liability management, unbalanced risk-sharing partnerships, lack of transparency, inadequate project evaluation, incompatible corporate governance structures and cyber security all pose threats to BRI SCs specifically and SCs in general. Research limitations/implications Academically, the results facilitate theory development by identifying and proposing seven risk factors and modeling relationship among them and BRI SC risks outcome. The results also extend application of theory of risk management to SC context. Practical implications The findings provide a decision-making tool for managers to assess risk factors in their SCs, thus enabling improved decision making to avoid, mitigate, transfer or accept risks. Originality/value Identifies and proposes a set of seven risk factors that drive BRI SC risks. Develops a model of BRI SC risks which help build theory of SC risk management.",10.1108/IJLM-12-2019-0366,"Ram, Jiwat; Zhang, Zeyang"

Exploring the dynamics of water innovation: Foundations for water innovation studies,2018,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.34886952057811,"The urgent need for innovation to address multifaceted and intertwined water-related challenges is becoming increasingly clear, acknowledged and responded to with cumulating sources and amounts of funding. Nevertheless, the water sector has been claimed to be less innovative than other sectors. This Special Volume on the dynamics of water innovation is based on the realization that, in general, there is a striking absence of academic studies on the dynamics of water innovation. This SV is therefore designed to lay the foundations for the field of water innovation studies, in an effort to integrate the emerging insights. Together, the contributions in this SV capture the current understanding of the dynamics of water innovation and provide insights into how the water innovation process can be fostered. The purpose of this introductory article is threefold, namely to frame the discussion on water innovation dynamics in order to contextualise the contributions of this SV, to provide systematic guidance for studying water innovation dynamics and to suggest the way forward for water innovation studies. It captures the extent of the field of water innovation studies with a review of the literature of the last three decades and frames water innovations. Based on five decades of innovation research and drawing on three areas (management, strategy and policy), we provide an innovation studies taxonomy that consists of four organising dimensions: type of innovation, stage of innovation, level of analysis and measurement. This taxonomy enables researchers to study the dynamics of water innovation from different combinations of conceptual and thematic angles, drawing on the field of innovation studies in a systematic fashion. Finally, we reflect on the way forward for water innovation studies with suggestions for future research.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.118,"Wehn, Uta; Montalvo, Carlos"
CookieConsumer: Tracking online behavioural advertising in Australia,2016,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"Online behavioural advertising (OBA) comes to consumers at a price. Often unknowingly, people deliver up commercially-valuable personal information as a condition of online user experience, functionality and access. Websites are increasingly tracking user behaviours for commercial purposes and social media derives its income largely from data collection and advertising targeted to the personal disclosures and behavioural attributes which are its data-production mainstay. In this context, consumers face a plethora of information collection practices, all designed to generate data analytics including inferential and predictive profiling to create a ‘digital identity’ for OBA purposes. In this subterranean exchange, consumers are economically redefined as data subjects and advertising targets; a reframing which is perhaps why the OBA industry faces a crisis in consumer concern, both as to privacy and trust. This paper proposes that the regulatory control of OBA in Australia is in disarray. Consumer ignorance of online privacy management and OBA practices is demonstrable. Industry transparency, disclosure, consent processes and compliance practices are questionable. Regulator interest is minimal, industry self-regulation is weak and consumer technical ability and personal responsibility is a last fragile line of defence. Data breaches are ubiquitous in a crowded and poorly-audited supply chain, and entail significant adverse consumer consequences. Yet despite these serious concerns, Australian regulators are failing to respond to OBA issues, either through mandating greater industry disclosure or through regulatory action. The author seeks to expose these weaknesses in calling for consumer and privacy regulators to take more meaningful action to better protect consumers' interests online.",10.1016/j.clsr.2015.12.006,"Mathews-Hunt, Kate"
Agile management to secure competitiveness in times of digital transformation in medium-sized businesses,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.9053579383608396,"With the digital transformation, companies will experience a change that focuses on shaping the organization into an agile organizational form.

"Connecting the dots in trustworthy Artificial Intelligence: From AI principles, ethics, and key requirements to responsible AI systems and regulation",2023,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,1.0,"Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on seven technical requirements sustained over three main pillars that should be met throughout the system’s entire life cycle: it should be (1) lawful, (2) ethical, and (3) robust, both from a technical and a social perspective. However, attaining truly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness of all processes and actors that are part of the system’s life cycle, and considers previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision contemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and requirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement for trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be implemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement trustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of AI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a responsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a concept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes, subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our multidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the diverging views published lately about the future of AI. Our reflections in this matter conclude that regulation is a key for reaching a consensus among these views, and that trustworthy and responsible AI systems will be crucial for the present and future of our society.",10.1016/j.inffus.2023.101896,"Díaz-Rodríguez, Natalia; Del Ser, Javier; Coeckelbergh, Mark; López de Prado, Marcos; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique; Herrera, Francisco"
Hardware security modules for sustainable energy systems: Targeted review,2025,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.5707774928744187,"As the global transition toward green energy intensifies, the integration of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) into sustainable energy systems is emerging as a critical component for ensuring cybersecurity and operational resilience. HSMs are essential for safeguarding sensitive data, enabling secure communication, and maintaining the integrity of operations within smart grids and renewable energy infrastructures, which are increasingly susceptible to cyber threats. Despite the growing relevance of HSMs in this domain, there remains a significant gap in the academic literature concerning their specific adoption and optimization in sustainable energy contexts. This paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the role and integration of HSMs in sustainable energy systems. It examines how HSMs enhance system security through advanced cryptographic protections, operational robustness, and secure data exchange. The study further explores key optimization strategies, such as energy-efficient circuit design, advanced process technologies, and duty-cycling mechanisms that align HSM functionality with energy sustainability goals. Additionally, the paper identifies and discusses major challenges affecting HSM deployment, such as cost constraints, energy consumption, and interoperability with legacy infrastructure. By synthesizing these findings, the paper unveils the strategic implementation of HSMs in sustainable energy frameworks and lays a foundation for future empirical investigations aimed at validating and extending the discussed approaches.",10.1016/j.ijcip.2025.100791,"Alzoubi, Yehia Ibrahim"

Evolving uses of artificial intelligence in human resource management in emerging economies in the global South: some preliminary evidence,2021,5,Topic_5_ai_artificial_artificial intelligence,0.28334781002912024,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in human resource management (HRM) in the Global South. Design/methodology/approach Multiple case studies of AI tools used in HRM in these countries in recruiting and selecting as well as developing, retaining and productively utilizing employees have been used. Findings With AI deployment in HRM, organizations can enhance efficiency in recruitment and selection and gain access to a larger recruitment pool. With AI deployment in HRM, subjective criteria such as nepotism and favoritism are less likely to come into play in recruitment and selection of employees. AI deployment in HRM also has a potentially positive impact on the development, retainment and productive utilization of employees. Research limitations/implications AI is an evolving technology. Most HRM apps have not gained enough machine learning capabilities with real-world experience. Some of them lack a scientific basis.

CLOUD act agreements from an EU perspective,2020,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"For many years, transatlantic cooperation between the EU and the US in the area of personal data exchange has been a subject of special interest on the part of lawmakers, courts – including supranational ones – NGOs and the public. When implementing recent reform of data protection law, the European Union decided to further strengthen guarantees of the protection of privacy in cyberspace. At the same time, however, it faced the practical problem of how to ensure compliance with these principles in relation to third countries. The approach proposed in the GDPR, which is based on a newly-defined territorial scope of application, clearly indicates an attempt to apply EU rules extraterritorially in relation to data processors in third countries. Irrespective of EU activity, the United States has also introduced its own regulations addressing the same problem. An example is the federal law adopted in 2018, specifying how to execute national court orders for the transfer of electronic data. The CLOUD Act was established in response to legal doubts raised in the Microsoft v United States case regarding the transfer of electronic data stored in the cloud by US obliged entities to law enforcement authorities, as well as in cases where this data is physically located in another country and its transfer could result in violating the legal norms of a foreign jurisdiction. The CLOUD Act also facilitates bilateral international agreements that enable the cross-border transfer of e-evidence for the purposes of ongoing criminal proceedings. Both the content of the new regulations and the model proposed by the US legislature for future agreements concluded on the basis of the CLOUD Act can be seen as an alternative to regulations arising from EU law. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the CLOUD Act and CLOUD Act Agreements from the perspective of EU law and, in particular, attempt to answer the question as to whether this new legal mechanism brings the EU and the USA closer to finding common ground with regard to a coherent model of exchange and protection of personal data.",10.1016/j.clsr.2020.105442,"Rojszczak, Marcin"

This paper aims to investigate the contextual factors influencing L&D roles in organisations, the strategic and operational roles that L&D professionals play in organisations, the competencies and career trajectories of L&D professionals, the perceptions of multiple internal stakeholders of the effectiveness of L&D roles and the relationships between context, L&D roles, competencies/expertise and perceived organisational effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach The study findings are based on the use of multiple methods. The authors gathered data from executives, senior managers, line managers, employee and L&D professionals using multiple methods: a survey (n = 440), Delphi study (n = 125) and semi-structured interviews (n = 30). Findings The analysis revealed that L&D professionals increasingly respond to a multiplicity of external and internal contextual influences and internal stakeholders perceived the effectiveness of L&D professionals differently with significant gaps in perceptions of what L&D contributes to organisational effectiveness. L&D professionals perform both strategic and operational roles in organisations and they progress through four career levels. Each L&D role and career level requires a distinct and unique set of foundational competencies and L&D expertise.

Information ecology in digitalising welfare services: a multi-level analysis,2020,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.8655467257142003,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine and reinterpret information ecology in the context of the changing environment of services, which has been strongly affected by digitalisation and increasing citizen engagement. Here, information ecology refers to the interaction and co-evolution of technologies, human beings and the social environment. Design/methodology/approach The data consist of 25 thematic interviews conducted in a public Finnish organisation responsible for organising welfare services, and in its collaborating organisations. The interviews were analysed qualitatively. The analytical framework is based on Nardi and O'Day's five components of information ecology: system, diversity, co-evolution, keystone species and locality. Findings The analysis shows that these basic components still exist in the digitalisation era, but that they should be interpreted and highlighted differently, for example, stressing the openness of the information system instead of closed systems, as well as emphasising the increasing meaning of diversity amongst digitalisation, and the dynamic co-evolution between the elements of the system. New capabilities, such as the ability to combine various kinds of information and knowledge, are needed in this adaptation. Research limitations/implications The study illustrates a wider, updated information-ecology concept with the help of empirical research.

Logistics and distribution challenges to managing operations for corporate sustainability: Study on leading Indian diary organizations,2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"In order to improve the corporate sustainability of agro-food value chains, business organizations need to rely on a higher performing and more reliable logistics system. Particularly, in case of dairy industry, organizations are facing some important challenges containing people management, short shelf life, high food losses and wastage, high greenhouse gas emissions. Based on “Confederation of Indian industry - Dairy Vision 2025”, it is believed that the dairy sector in India has high potential if organizations can develop an effective logistics and supply chain system. This article attempts to analyze the interaction between distribution related challenges with a focus operational excellence and higher corporate green growth and sustainability viewpoints in food supply chains by considering the business example of four Indian dairy product based organizations using graph theory and matrix approach. Several key challenges were identified based on a literature survey and experts’ views. Graph theory and matrix approach has been applied to select the most significant challenge. The results show that food organizations must work on cold chain to manage logistics and distribution challenges to reduce wastage, decrease financial losses and to take environmental issues into account. This paper ranks the challenges as well as develop an index for the dairy industry to achieve corporate sustainability in its supply chain and logistics network. The present study findings will provide useful knowledge for managers and policy makers managing interaction between people and process aspects and corporate sustainability management in the agro-based diary organizational logistics and supply chains.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an objective and accurate summary of BIM knowledge using 1874 published BIM-related papers. The results show that 60 key research areas, such as information systems, 3D modeling, design and sustainability and 10 key research clusters, such as architecture design studio, building information and lean construction, are extremely important for the development of BIM knowledge. The results are useful for the identification of research clusters and topics in the BIM community. More importantly, these results can help highlight how BIM-related research evolves over time, thus greatly contributing to understanding the underlying structure of BIM. This study offers useful and new insights to summarize the status quo of BIM knowledge and can be used as a dynamic platform to integrate future BIM developments.",10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.011,"Li, Xiao; Wu, Peng; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping; Wang, Xiangyu; Teng, Yue"
"Development of the Internet of Things sensory technology for ensuring proper indoor air quality in hospital facilities: Taxonomy analysis, challenges, motivations, open issues and recommended solution",2022,-1,Outliers,0.33045943991988874,"Recent studies have focused on how to develop air quality-monitoring systems through smart sensor networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. These works span a wide range of health research advancements in hospitals to improve air quality architecture and technologies, such as IoT-enabled gas sensors, hardware components and cloud computing. The benefits for comfort and productivity of good indoor air quality (IAQ) conditions in hospitals are an essential need. However, minimal attention has been paid to the review of the development of IoT-based sensory technology for proper IAQ in hospital facilities. Therefore, this study provided classification taxonomy for IoT-enabled IAQ systems and a systematic review of works concerning that classification to address the ambiguity in such trends. To this end, this study checked five databases: ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. A total of 926 papers from 2016 to 2021 were collected, and the retrieved articles were filtered in accordance with the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria to obtain the final set of 27 articles. The collected articles were classified into two categories on the basis of the aim and objective evidence across studies that fit the prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The first category, which contained (n = 10/27) articles (37.03%), was ‘Integrated Indoor–outdoor Monitoring of Air Quality.’ The second category was ‘IAQ Contexts.’ This category contained (n = 17/27) articles (62.97%) and had five subcategories. Consequently, this study revealed new research opportunities, such as motivations, challenges and limitations and recommendations, which require attention for the synergistic integration of interdisciplinary works. Moreover, this extensive study listed a set of open issues and provided innovative key solutions, along with a systematic review, for IAQ-based IoT sensor deployment focusing on hospital facilities. The investigation of the recommended IAQ pollutants and parameters for hospital facilities depended on systematic literature and reliable organisations (Environmental Protection Agency, ISO and World Health Organisation). The required sensors for the most common pollutants and parameters, IoT hardware and devices and the required pollution thresholds utilised in IAQ for hospital facilities were highlighted and discussed. A set of available dataset information related to IAQ and the available resources were presented. The lifecycle of the context of IAQ phases was mapped for the first time, including the procedure sequencing and definition for each context to enhance IAQ-based IoT systems in future. We believe that this study is a useful guide for researchers and practitioners in providing direction and valuable information for ensuring proper IAQ research in future, especially in hospital facilities.",10.1016/j.measurement.2022.110920,"Saad Baqer, Noor; Mohammed, Hussein A.; Albahri, A.S.; Zaidan, A.A.; Al-qaysi, Z.T.; Albahri, O.S."

Investigating biofuels through network analysis,2016,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.32609187053495803,"Biofuel policies are motivated by a plethora of political concerns related to energy security, environmental damages, and support of the agricultural sector. In response to this, much scientific work has chiefly focussed on analysing the biofuel domain and on giving policy advice and recommendations. Although innovation has been acknowledged as one of the key factors in sustainable and cost-effective biofuel development, there is an urgent need to investigate technological trajectories in the biofuel sector by starting from consistent data and appropriate methodological tools. To do so, this work proposes a procedure to select patent data unequivocally related to the investigated sector, it uses co-occurrence of technological terms to compute patent similarity and highlights content and interdependencies of biofuels technological trajectories by revealing hidden topics from unstructured patent text fields. The analysis suggests that there is a breaking trend towards modern generation biofuels and that innovators seem to focus increasingly on the ability of alternative energy sources to adapt to the transport/industrial sector.",10.1016/j.enpol.2016.07.001,"Curci, Ylenia; Mongeau Ospina, Christian A."
Privatization and its aftermath: Are we facing a new displacement force?,2022,6,Topic_6_smart_city_smart city,0.7770820280096876,"The privatization of once publicly-funded affordable housing is the primary tool for preserving and maintaining affordable housing. This process, however, is quietly creating urban migration patterns that are altering the demographic profile of cities with cumulative change that we cannot fully estimate at this stage. There is growing need for a granular analysis at the parcel level to refocus the spotlight on this quiet displacement force. To start filling this lacuna, the article links privatization processes to gentrification and displacement. Through a case study of the privatization of Mitchell Lama buildings on Roosevelt Island, NYC, and the demographic changes it has engendered, this study points to a more significant trend of privatization of housing projects in American cities and worldwide. Its main argument is that, despite their quiet nature, which differs fundamentally from the Urban Renewal projects of the 1960s, the cumulative change they produce may be similar. On this basis, this study's main contribution is an in-depth, small-scale analysis aimed at deciphering the mechanisms, motivations, and decision-making processes of households experiencing ongoing privatization. Through a combination of ethnographic fieldwork, urban historical research, and statistical analysis, the study identifies three urban trends: 1. Privatization may lead to exclusionary displacement through increases in rent and cost of living; 2. Privatization may lead to social displacement pressures such as a sense of loss of place, loss of friends and community, and resentment among long-term residents; and 3. If the right policies are developed, privatization can present an opportunity for upward social mobility.",10.1016/j.jum.2022.02.002,"Yavo-Ayalon, Sharon"

Developing a cyber security culture: Current practices and future needs,2021,-1,Outliers,0.21675857544541033,"While the creation of a strong security culture has been researched and discussed for decades, it continues to elude many businesses. Part of the challenge faced is distilling pertinent, recent academic findings and research into useful guidance. In this article, we aim to tackle this issue by conducting a state-of-the-art study into organisational cyber security culture research. This work investigates four questions, including how cyber security culture is defined, what factors are essential to building and maintaining such a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a security culture and the metrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA systematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research articles from the last 10 years (2010-2020). Our findings demonstrate that while there have been notable changes in the use of terms (e.g., information security culture and cyber security culture), many of the most influential factors are similar. Top management support, policy and procedures, and awareness for instance, are critical in engendering cyber security culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed revealed common foundations, with organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting appropriate cyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used tool to measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to whether more dynamic measures are needed. For practitioners, this article highlights factors and models essential to the creation and management of a robust security culture. For research, we produce an up-to-date characterisation of the field and also define open issues deserving of further attention such as the role of change management processes and national culture in an enterprise's cyber security culture.",10.1016/j.cose.2021.102387,"Uchendu, Betsy; Nurse, Jason R.C.; Bada, Maria; Furnell, Steven"
IoT-based telemedicine for disease prevention and health promotion: State-of-the-Art,2021,-1,Outliers,0.32271632824207,"Numerous studies have focused on making telemedicine smart through the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. These works span a wide range of research areas to enhance telemedicine architecture such as network communications, artificial intelligence methods and techniques, IoT wearable sensors and hardware devices, smartphones and cloud computing. Accordingly, several telemedicine applications covering various human diseases have presented their works from a specific perspective and resulted in confusion regarding the IoT characteristics. Although such applications are useful and necessary for improving telemedicine contexts related to monitoring, detection and diagnostics, deriving an overall picture of how IoT characteristics are currently integrated with the telemedicine architecture is difficult. Accordingly, this study complements the academic literature with a systematic review covering all main aspects of advances in IoT-based telemedicine architecture. This study also provides a state-of-the-art telemedicine classification taxonomy under IoT and reviews works in different fields in relation to that classification. To this end, this study checked the ScienceDirect, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and Web of Science databases.

Context matters: A review of the determinant factors in the decision to adopt cloud computing in healthcare,2019,-1,Outliers,0.05071482840208507,"Cloud computing is an IT service paradigm that can, if used meaningfully, enhance traditional health IT approaches and offer major benefits to the healthcare industry. However, its adoption by healthcare organizations has been accompanied by diverse challenges that could impede its meaningful use. Decisions about its adoption should be made after serious consideration of relevant industry-specific factors. Whereas the literature has focused on cloud computing adoption in general, the industrial specificities that influence the decision to adopt cloud computing in the healthcare context have yet to be systematically addressed. We reviewed empirical studies on both information systems and medical informatics to investigate the determinant factors of the cloud computing adoption decision in healthcare organizations and the industrial specificities of those factors. Based on the results of our review, we proposed a conceptual framework of cloud computing adoption studies in healthcare and made seven recommendations for related future research. Our research contributes to the theory by providing a comprehensive list of industry-specific factors that influence cloud computing adoption decisions in healthcare and explains their specificities for the healthcare industry.

Classification of the existing knowledge base of OR/MS research and practice (1990–2019) using a proposed classification scheme,2020,-1,Outliers,0.11736407394224271,"Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) has traditionally been defined as the discipline that applies advanced analytical methods to help make better and more informed decisions. The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of the existing knowledge base of OR/MS research and practice using a proposed keywords-based approach. A conceptual structure is necessary in order to place in context the findings of our keyword analysis. Towards this we first present a classification scheme that relies on keywords that appeared in articles published in important OR/MS journals from 1990–2019 (over 82,000 articles). Our classification scheme applies a methodological approach towards keyword selection and its systematic classification, wherein approximately 1300 most frequently used keywords (in terms of cumulative percentage, these keywords and their derivations account for more than 45% of the approx. 290,000 keyword occurrences used by the authors to represent the content of their articles) were selected and organised in a classification scheme with seven top-level categories and multiple levels of sub-categories. The scheme identified the most commonly used keywords relating to OR/MS problems, modeling techniques and applications. Next, we use this proposed scheme to present an analysis of the last 30 years, in three distinct time periods, to show the changes in OR/MS literature.

We have classified the articles in the journal along five dimensions: content, methods, environmental media, the regional dimension of studies, and cross-cutting issues. While up to about 10 years ago, non-market valuation and cost-benefit analysis, natural resource economics, and environmental policy instruments represented the lion's share of articles published in the journal, more recently we observe a significant shift towards a more diversified array of research areas, with climate change and energy issues finding their way into the journal. In addition, increasing methodological plurality becomes apparent, reflected in a significant shift away from economic theory and towards empirical approaches. We also analyze key distinctions between the major environmental economics journals. Finally, we analyze JEEM's external influence on leading general economics (A+) journals. We find that A+ citations are positively correlated with a focus on climate change economics, market-based environmental policies and policy comparisons, the use of econometric and statistical methods or experimental approaches, and negatively correlated with a focus on water pollution and other pollutants such as pesticides.",10.1016/j.jeem.2018.08.001,"Kube, Roland; Löschel, Andreas; Mertens, Henrik; Requate, Till"
Data exfiltration: A review of external attack vectors and countermeasures,2018,1,Topic_1_blockchain_security_data,0.5179440643685159,"Context One of the main targets of cyber-attacks is data exfiltration, which is the leakage of sensitive or private data to an unauthorized entity. Data exfiltration can be perpetrated by an outsider or an insider of an organization. Given the increasing number of data exfiltration incidents, a large number of data exfiltration countermeasures have been developed. These countermeasures aim to detect, prevent, or investigate exfiltration of sensitive or private data. With the growing interest in data exfiltration, it is important to review data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures to support future research in this field. Objective This paper is aimed at identifying and critically analysing data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures for reporting the status of the art and determining gaps for future research. Method We have followed a structured process for selecting 108 papers from seven publication databases. Thematic analysis method has been applied to analyse the extracted data from the reviewed papers. Results We have developed a classification of (1) data exfiltration attack vectors used by external attackers and (2) the countermeasures in the face of external attacks. We have mapped the countermeasures to attack vectors. Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of various countermeasures for different states of data (i.e., in use, in transit, or at rest). Conclusion This review has revealed that (a) most of the state of the art is focussed on preventive and detective countermeasures and significant research is required on developing investigative countermeasures that are equally important; (b) Several data exfiltration countermeasures are not able to respond in real-time, which specifies that research efforts need to be invested to enable them to respond in real-time (c) A number of data exfiltration countermeasures do not take privacy and ethical concerns into consideration, which may become an obstacle in their full adoption (d) Existing research is primarily focussed on protecting data in ‘in use’ state, therefore, future research needs to be directed towards securing data in ‘in rest’ and ‘in transit’ states (e) There is no standard or framework for evaluation of data exfiltration countermeasures. We assert the need for developing such an evaluation framework.",10.1016/j.jnca.2017.10.016,"Ullah, Faheem; Edwards, Matthew; Ramdhany, Rajiv; Chitchyan, Ruzanna; Babar, M. Ali; Rashid, Awais"
Elaborating Models of eHealth Governance: Qualitative Systematic Review,2020,-1,Outliers,0.17156469599337582,"Background Large-scale national eHealth policy programs have gained attention not only for benefits but also for several unintended consequences and failed expectations. Given the complex and mixed accounts of the results, questions have been raised on how large-scale digitalization programs are governed to reach health policy goals of quality improvement and equal access along with necessary digital transformations. In this qualitative systematic review, we investigate the following question: How is governance implemented and considered in the studies included in the qualitative review? Objective The aim of this study is to arrive at informed and recognizable conceptualizations and considerations of models of governance connected to eHealth, as presented and discussed in the scientific literature. In turn, we hope our results will help inform the discussion of how to govern such processes to obtain collectively negotiated objectives. Methods A qualitative systematic review is a method for integrating or comparing with the findings from qualitative studies. It looks for “themes” or “constructs” that lie in or across individual qualitative studies. This type of review produces a narrative synthesis with thematic analysis and includes interpretive conceptual models. The goal is an interpretation and broadens the understanding of a particular phenomenon. We searched the PubMed database using predefined search terms and selected papers published from 2010 onwards. We specified the criteria for selection and quality assessment. Results The search returned 220 papers. We selected 44 abstracts for full-text reading, and 11 papers were included for full-text synthesis. On the basis of the 11 papers, we constructed four governance models to categorize and conceptualize the findings. The models are political governance, normally depicting top-down processes; medical governance, which normally depicts bottom-up processes; the internet and global model, emphasizing international business strategies coupled with the internet; self-governance, which builds upon the development of the internet and Internet of Things, which has paved the way for personal governance and communication of one’s own health data. Conclusions Collective negotiations between the nation-state and global policy actors, medical and self-governance actors, and global business and industry actors are essential. Technological affordances represent both positive and negative opportunities concerning the realization of health policy goals, and future studies should scrutinize this dynamic.",10.2196/17214,"Ekeland, Anne Granstrom; Linstad, Line Helen"
Information management in lean office deployment contexts,2020,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.2402810969790506,"Purpose Lean office covers the improvement of administrative processes and information flows. In offices, one of the essential challenges is to coordinate the development of information management capabilities. Thus, this paper aims to identify the key factors of information management in lean office deployment contexts. Design/methodology/approach By adopting a qualitative approach, it consists of theoretical research that applies grounded theory's coding technique and exploits 27 scientific studies on lean office published in the past 20 years. Findings It identifies five key factors for managing information into an organizational structure that optimizes information flow, such as “information-seeking,” “access to information,” “information quality,” “information processing” and “use of information and communication technology”. Research limitations/implications Data analysis was restricted in scientific research regarding lean office deployment. Therefore, the accuracy of the concepts and categories of information management proposed in this paper can be adjusted and validated in future research, thus deepening the discussion of its findings. Practical implications It highlights issues for managing information in contemporary organizations such as failures in information retrieval, restrictions on access to information, lack of quality information, inadequate information processing criteria and inefficiency of information systems infrastructure. Originality/value It analyzes the lean office deployment from the theoretical framework of information management. Thus, it differs from other studies in this field because it is not limited to the operational aspects of lean management. Nevertheless, it shows that lean office reconfigures information flows and continually improves organizations’ strategic management.",10.1108/IJLSS-10-2019-0105,"Freitas, Rodrigo de Castro; Freitas, Maria do Carmo Duarte"
Identifying future directions for IC research in education: a literature review,2018,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.26937913483092507,"Purpose It is important to have a literature review to open any special issue as a way of introducing the state-of-the-art topics and link past research with the papers appearing in this special issue on IC in education. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach This research uses the structured literature to investigate the state-of-the-art and future directions of IC literature in education. In total, 47 articles are explored including nine from this special issue. Findings IC in education research is concentrated in Europe and mainly addresses IC in universities. Additionally, current IC research is progressing by examining IC practices inside universities using a third-stage IC approach, with new research also concentrating on third-mission outcomes, thus there is scope to continue IC and education research beyond universities. IC in education can also expand into fifth stage IC research, which abandons the boundaries of the educational institution and concentrate on the impact of IC and education on multiple stakeholders. Research limitations/implications Current IC in education research is too narrow and mainly investigates IC in European contexts using case study methodology. However, there is ample scope to widen research that develops new frameworks in different educational and country contexts using a wider range of research methodologies. IC in education needs to expand its boundaries so it does not lose its relevance, and thus be able to contribute to wider policy debates. Originality/value This paper presents the current state-of-the-art structured literature review of the articles investigating IC in education.",10.1108/JIC-10-2017-0133,"Bisogno, Marco; Dumay, John; Manes Rossi, Francesca; Tartaglia Polcini, Paolo"
Reassessing the scope of OR practice: The Influences of Problem Structuring Methods and the Analytics Movement,2015,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.15289037336674072,"Abstract This paper argues that if OR is to prosper it needs to more closely reflect the needs of organisations and its practitioners. Past research has highlighted a gap between theoretical research developments, applications and the methods most frequently used in organisations. The scope of OR applications has also been contested with arguments as to the expanding boundaries of OR. But despite this, anecdotal evidence suggests that OR has become marginalised in many contexts. In order to understand these changes, IFORS (International Federation of OR Societies) in 2009 sponsored a survey of global OR practice. The aim was to provide current evidence on the usage of OR tools, areas of application, and the barriers to OR's uptake, as well as the educational background of OR practitioners. Results presented here show practitioners falling into three segments, which can be loosely characterised as those practicing ‘traditional’ OR, those adopting a range of softer techniques including Problem Structuring Methods (PSMs), and a Business Analytics cluster. When combined with other recent survey evidence, the use of PSMs and Business Analytics is apparently extending the scope of OR practice. In particular, the paper considers whether the Business Analytics movement, with an overlapping skill set to traditional OR but with a fast growing organisational base, offers a route to diminishing the gap between academic research and practice. The paper concludes with an exploration of whether this represents not just an opportunity for OR but also a serious challenge to its established practices.",10.1016/j.ejor.2015.01.058,"Ranyard, J.C.; Fildes, R.; Hu, Tun-I"
Safety and feasibility of same-day discharge following lumbar decompression surgery: A systematic review,2022,-1,Outliers,0.12104541921595333,"Introduction Lumbar decompression (LD) surgery, with or without discectomy, is a commonly performed surgical procedure. Despite the concept of day-case LD being reported as early as the 1980s, day-case LD is yet to become routine clinical practice. Research question This systematic review aimed to examine the published literature on the safety and complication rates of day-case LD. Secondary outcome measures, including the economic impact and patient satisfaction of day-case LD, were also examined. Materials and methods A systematic electronic search was carried out on PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library between 1999 and January 2022. Studies were screened against predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria with the quality of included studies subsequently being assessed. Results In total, 15 studies were included in this review. The majority of studies were undertaken in the USA (n ​= ​8, 53%) and were of a case series design (n ​= ​9, 60%). Reported complication rates ranged from 0% to 7.8%, with nine studies reporting a complication rate of <4%. Readmission rates ranged from 0% to 7.7%. Seven studies quoted a readmission rate of 0%. Five studies found cost saving benefits of day-case LD in comparison to inpatient LD of up to $27,984 (USD). Patient acceptability of day-case LD was consistently high across the six studies that assessed it. Discussion and conclusion Day-case LD surgery is a safe and economically efficient surgical option in appropriately selected patients.",10.1016/j.bas.2022.100888,"Goacher, Edward; Sanders, Matthew I.; Ivanov, Marcel"
Explicating the role of emerging technologies and firm capabilities towards attainment of competitive advantage in health insurance service firms,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.4161106421313262,"Competitive advantage of firms has been a dynamic notion evolving with changing business realities. Emerging technologies have entered the gamut of resources which firms need to actively forecast and manage for competitive advantage. This study explored the idea of competitive advantage in the context of health insurance firms and how emerging technologies can augment existing capabilities towards this goal. The critical nature of health insurance as a social necessity and the application of emerging technologies in healthcare justified the need to theoretically establish what competencies were required for health insurance firms for technology driven competitive advantage. A qualitative method using modified Delphi technique in sequential combination to 43 in-depth expert interviews was used to explicate the factors. Data was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative content and thematic intensity analysis. Organizational people orientation and service delivery capabilities emerged as foundations of a contemporary competitive advantage framework for health insurance firms supported by technical expertise, knowledge management practices and product innovation strategies. Results indicated that management of emerging technologies exerted a gravitational effect on firm competencies to create a contemporary competitive advantage framework. This study enriched the knowledge on competitive advantage by integrating new day technological imperatives with traditional firm competencies.",10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120892,"Nayak, Bishwajit; Bhattacharyya, Som Sekhar; Krishnamoorthy, Bala"
The efficiency of the public intervention on the environment:Evidence based on non-parametric and parametric approaches,2018,-1,Outliers,0.20545408767719758,"This paper evaluates the efficiency of the allocation of public resources aimed at complying with the European environmental directives. A full and partial frontier Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to a panel of decision-making units (i.e. a set of regions), with a specific focus on the air & water and biodiversity sectors. The Malmquist productivity index allows one to analyse regional productivity change; while a post-DEA, based upon Simar-Wilson approach, allows one to explore the factors that affect the performance. Overall, a specific group of regions outperform for air & water intervention while the reverse outcome is obtained for biodiversity. The findings also show a rather low technological change, especially for biodiversity. The post-DEA indicates that an increase in the tourism and agricultural activity exerts a negative impact on the air & water public efficiency, while has a positive influence on biodiversity. Higher education in technical subjects also increases performance.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.134,"Meleddu, Marta; Pulina, Manuela"
Assessing the Implementation of Digital Innovations in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic to Address Key Public Health Functions: Scoping Review of Academic and Nonacademic Literature,2022,-1,Outliers,0.14382897428152952,"Background Digital technologies have been central to efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, a range of literature has reported on developments regarding the implementation of new digital technologies for COVID-19–related surveillance, prevention, and control. Objective In this study, scoping reviews of academic and nonacademic literature were undertaken to obtain an overview of the evidence regarding digital innovations implemented to address key public health functions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to expand on the work of existing reviews by drawing on additional data sources (including nonacademic sources) by considering literature published over a longer time frame and analyzing data in terms of the number of unique digital innovations. Methods We conducted a scoping review of the academic literature published between January 1, 2020, and September 15, 2020, supplemented by a further scoping review of selected nonacademic literature published between January 1, 2020, and October 13, 2020. Both reviews followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) approach. Results A total of 226 academic articles and 406 nonacademic articles were included. The included articles provided evidence of 561 (academic literature) and 497 (nonacademic literature) unique digital innovations. The most common implementation settings for digital innovations were the United States, China, India, and the United Kingdom. Technologies most commonly used by digital innovations were those belonging to the high-level technology group of integrated and ubiquitous fixed and mobile networks. The key public health functions most commonly addressed by digital innovations were communication and collaboration and surveillance and monitoring. Conclusions Digital innovations implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have been wide ranging in terms of their implementation settings, the digital technologies used, and the public health functions addressed. However, evidence gathered through this study also points to a range of barriers that have affected the successful implementation of digital technologies for public health functions. It is also evident that many digital innovations implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are yet to be formally evaluated or assessed.",10.2196/34605,"Francombe, Joseph; Ali, Gemma-Claire; Gloinson, Emily Ryen; Feijao, Carolina; Morley, Katherine I; Gunashekar, Salil; de Carvalho Gomes, Helena"
Unearthing trends in environmental science and engineering research: Insights from a probabilistic topic modeling literature analysis,2021,-1,Outliers,0.09553162005106375,"Academic contributions in environmental science and engineering (ESE) research are needed to ensure a cleaner, productive, and environmentally conscious society. Hence, an understanding of the critical trends, topics, and research developments in the field is crucial towards facilitating the identification, communication, and improved research collaboration of nascent and increasingly complex environmental problems. As a deeper analysis of the broader trend evolution of ESE research is lacking in the literature, we employ a more robust content analysis approach in the form of a topic modeling computational text analysis method to unearth key temporal and regional insights in the field. As such, we apply a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on abstract metadata based on 3572 articles procured from reputable journals that published subject matter related to ESE research from 2005 to 2019 inclusive. We analyze the statistical composition of each inferred topic in the form of word clouds and uncover general research trends, such as topics related to environmental impact assessments, improved clean cookstoves, solid waste management, and environmental lead pollution. We also perform temporal analysis experiments across each respective journal and observe a high degree of consistency and variance among topic focuses. Moreover, whilst quantifying trends at the regional level, we detect that certain countries display clearly discernible patterns, suggesting that research communities in ESE from various countries tend to focus on different sub-fields. The main contribution of our work is the application of a more refined computer-assisted content analysis method in ESE trend analysis research that can serve as the foundation for future exploratory trend analysis investigations in ESE and other related fields.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128322,"Palanichamy, Yazwand; Kargar, Mehdi; Zolfagharinia, Hossein"
Future of artificial intelligence and its influence on supply chain risk management – A systematic review,2022,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7751540538319747,"Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is a rapidly growing field of research encompassing identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring of the risks or unexpected and unprecedented events. Among the researchers, there has been a significant focus on identifying, mitigating, and managing the risks that affect the supply chain (SC). Though the research on SCRM remains for an extended period, still the industries are facing difficulties in managing the SC risks. Also, the SC managers have begun to focus on decision-making based on numerous data sources for predicting the uncertainties more accurately to achieve a proactive and predictive intelligent risk management mechanism. These attributes make Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) suitable techniques in the SCRM field. The application of these techniques in SCRM is in a nascent stage. In this view, this paper presents a systematic and descriptive review of the literature and identifies the various AI and ML methods applied in different phases related to SCRM. Also, it investigates the different categories of SC risks and the existing articles based on the AI technique used. This analysis focuses on research articles related to SCRM from three scientific databases published between 2010 and 2021 for detailed study.

Integrating wireless sensor networks with statistical quality control to develop a cold chain system in food industries,2016,0,Topic_0_agriculture_agricultural_food,1.0,"Cold chain management is of importance for manufacturers in the food industry since they face the dilemma of having to choose between frozen storage and cool storage in delivering products to retailers or end-consumers. Frozen storage incurs high-energy consumption for the preservation of food products, whereas cool storage involves the constant threat of bacterial decay. Contemporary cold-chain development in temperature control usually focuses on single logistic chain rather than serving multiple channels. In order to overcome the aforementioned deficiency, this study proposes a time-temperature indicator (TTI) based cold-chain system, which uses wireless sensors for collecting temperature data and implements the formulation of Critical Control Point (CCP) criteria throughout the entire delivery process. In particular, this approach is based on an Internet-of-Things (IoT) architecture as well as international food standards named ISO 22,000. More importantly, four new business models including (1) cold chain home-delivery service; (2) Convenience store (CVS) indirect delivery; (3) CVS direct delivery; (4) flight kitchen service, are successfully developed for conducting performance assessment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can increase annual sales of braised pork rice from 4.44 million bowls to over 6 million bowls, create more distribution channels to increase extra revenue of more than US$6.35 million, and reduce 10% energy consumption in central kitchens to enhance turnover of electricity from US$14.23 raised to US$18.64 per kilowatt hour.",10.1016/j.csi.2015.12.004,"Shih, Chih-Wen; Wang, Chih-Hsuan"

Examining relational digital transformation through the unfolding of local practices of the Finnish taxi industry,2020,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Digital transformation has become a central construct in information systems (IS) research. Current conceptualizations largely attribute transformation to intentionality, focus on transformation within a single organization, or assign technology the role of a disruptive agent of change. Likewise, “digital” tends to be a general category of technology, rather than a specific technology enacted in a time and place. Inspired by Schatzkian practice theory and its site ontology, we suggest a contextual viewpoint on digital transformation and call it “relational digital transformation.” We analyzed the change dynamics in the context of taxi dispatch practice in Finland, studying the changing taxi dispatch platforms over years. We investigated five powerful industry actors: two incumbents, two entrants, and a federation of taxi entrepreneurs. We identified events of change in the material arrangements in sites and explain the changes through the process dynamics in the focal practice. We define relational digital transformation as a process through which practice-arrangement bundles of digital technologies evolve over time. This approach assumes the default nature of an industry is to be found in the changing relations between entities rather than in entities themselves. This provides a theoretical extension to the prevailing views of digital transformation in IS literature. It enables studying digital transformation in retrospect without attributing change agency to any entities or technologies a priori. We also contribute to practice-theoretical IS literature by demonstrating how the applicability of practice theoretical analysis extends beyond microphenomena to larger industry-level changes.",10.1016/j.jsis.2020.101622,"Lanamäki, Arto; Väyrynen, Karin; Laari-Salmela, Sari; Kinnula, Marianne"

While this enormously facilitates the sharing of information, both for personal and professional purposes, it also introduces some critical problems concerning the ownership of the information. Data is an intangible good that is stored in large data warehouses, where the hardware architectures and software programs running the cloud services coexist with the data of many users. This context calls for a twofold protection: on one side, the cloud is made up of hardware and software that constitute the business assets of the service provider (property of the cloud); on the other side, there is a definite need to ensure that users retain control over their data (property in the cloud). The law grants protection to both sides under several perspectives, but the result is a complex mix of interwoven regimes, further complicated by the intrinsically international nature of cloud computing that clashes with the typical diversity of national laws.

Machine learning and hybrid intelligence for wind energy optimization: A comprehensive state-of-the-art review,2026,-1,Outliers,0.33674183136873853,"Wind energy plays a pivotal role in the global transition toward sustainable energy. However, its intermittent and stochastic nature presents challenges in achieving optimal performance, reliability, and seamless grid integration. Recent advances in machine intelligence—including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and reinforcement learning (RL)—offer powerful tools to address these challenges across forecasting, control, maintenance, and diagnostics. This systematic review provides a comprehensive evaluation of how machine intelligence has contributed to the optimization of wind energy systems. These techniques have been applied to enhance turbine-level performance, reduce power losses, predict faults, and maximize energy yield under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Particular emphasis is placed on hybrid models that combine data-driven algorithms with physical dynamics and domain heuristics, enabling real-time, predictive, and autonomous wind farm operations. Furthermore, the study critically examines integration barriers such as noisy SCADA data, regulatory compliance, computational costs, and sustainability trade-offs. The findings highlight that multi-objective optimization—balancing energy production, system resilience, and cost efficiency—is central to the most successful implementations. Hybrid frameworks, explainable artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing, and transfer learning are identified as key enablers for scalable deployment.

"Theory informed by practice. Application informed by purpose. Why to understand and manage risk, cultural context is the key",2017,-1,Outliers,0.13263411338861822,"Risk analysis and risk management are reliant in order to be effective on their ability to engage with and communicate to non-specialist audiences, whether these be policy-makers asked to turn the advice that they agree with into practice, those implementing decisions, or the public, who are often on the receiving end of these. Accordingly, there needs to be clarity of purpose regarding – and reflected through – the language used, the partners engaged, and the proposed ends of any measures to be implemented. These elements sit within specific cultural contexts – both geographical and historical – and it is essential to account for these in translating theory into practice. This article surveys the discourse used across various examples, including a detailed case study. The most significant conclusion is that while data and evidence certainly matter for validation – understanding culture remains key to effective risk analysis and trustworthy risk management because, on the whole, people look for meaning beyond the mere ‘facts’.1A recent exemple of this might be the election of Donald Trump as the President of the United States of America, where despite his detractors being supported by an army of ‘fact-checkers’ and voters being alert to his lies (and personality flaws), still he was elected, on the basis presumably, of what he appeared to stand for, beyond the immediate evidence.1 This applies to risks assumed to be narrowly technical as much as those with a strong social, cultural and political dimension. Insufficient risk analysts and safety experts consider or account for the broader, contextual and cultural factors that impact their choices, analyses and modes of dissemination.2‘Human factors’ analysis tends to focus on individual needs and foibles rather than their wider societal framing.2 This creates a divide between those commissioning and conducting the research and those to whom it is held to apply and needs to be implemented by, which undermines democratic accountability, as well as the possible benefits of, and trust in, their enterprise.",10.1016/j.ssci.2017.04.002,"Durodié, Bill"
Social mobility and Fair Access to the accountancy profession in the UK,2017,-1,Outliers,0.08278893080084514,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to consider how Big Four and mid-tier accountancy firms in the UK are responding to political concerns about social mobility and Fair Access to the accountancy profession. Design/methodology/approach Interviews were undertaken with 18 public accountancy firms, ranked in the Top 30 by fee income, operating in the UK to identify how they are recruiting staff in the light of the Fair Access to the Professions’ agenda. Bourdieusian sociology is used to inform the findings. Findings The Big Four firms employ a discourse of hiring “the brightest and the best” to satisfy perceived client demand, where symbolic capital is instantiated by reputational capital, reflecting prestige and specialisation, supported by a workforce with elite credentials. For mid-tier firms, reputational capital is interpreted as the need for individuals to service a diverse client portfolio. In general, most interviewees demonstrated relatively limited awareness of the issues surrounding the Fair Access agenda. Research limitations/implications The interviews with accountancy firms are both exploratory and cross-sectional. Furthermore, the study was undertaken at an embryonic point (2010) in the emerging Fair Access discourse. Future work considering the accountancy profession could usefully examine if, and how, matters have progressed. Social implications The investigation finds that accountancy firms remain relatively socially exclusive, largely due to the requirement for high educational entry standards, and interviewees’ responses generally indicate only limited attempts at engagement with political agendas of promoting Fair Access to the profession. Originality/value This paper is the first to empirically evaluate how the accountancy profession is responding to the Fair Access agenda; documents changing patterns of recruitment in accountancy employment, including the hiring of non-graduates to undertake professional work; and augments the literature considering social class and accounting.",10.1108/AAAJ-10-2012-1133,"Duff, Angus"
Consolidation and fragmentation in environmental scanning: A review and research agenda,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.40853718655381754,"Environmental scanning is a broadly defined concept, having first received attention from scholars in the late 1960s. Over the years a number of similar and overlapping constructs have emerged in management literature. The aim of this study, via a systematic review and thematic analysis of relevant empirical research, is to consolidate foundation environmental scanning knowledge, demonstrate how scanning research has developed and fragmented over time, and propose an agenda for future research. The first contribution of our review is a new typology of environmental scanning research made up of five discrete research views, which provides a more comprehensive and contemporary overview of the field than previous studies. The second is a proposed agenda for future research that explicitly acknowledges the role of technology, an area that is presently underdeveloped in foundation scanning literature. The third contribution is to signpost future directions for research on scanning and organisational performance using a number of theoretical perspectives. The overall outcome of our review is to move scanning research on from increasingly incremental contributions concerned with context to a place where the changing role of technology and the mechanisms through which environmental scanning contributes to competitive advantage can be more thoroughly understood.",10.1016/j.lrp.2020.101997,"Robinson, Craig V.; Ahmad, Farhan; Simmons, John E.L."
Patching the patchwork: appraising the EU regulatory framework on cyber security breaches,2018,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,0.4365131981883345,"Breaches of security, a.k.a. security and data breaches, are on the rise, one of the reasons being the well-known lack of incentives to secure services and their underlying technologies, such as cloud computing. In this article, I question whether the patchwork of six EU instruments addressing breaches is helping to prevent or mitigate breaches as intended. At a lower level of abstraction, the question concerns appraising the success of each instrument separately. At a higher level of abstraction, since all laws converge on the objective of network and information security – one of the three pillars of the EU cyber security policy – the question is whether the legal ‘patchwork’ is helping to ‘patch’ the underlying insecurity of network and information systems thus contributing to cyber security. To answer the research question, I look at the regulatory framework as a whole, from the perspective of network and information security and consequently I use the expression cyber security breaches. I appraise the regulatory patchwork by using the three goals of notification identified by the European Commission as a benchmark, enriched by policy documents, legal analysis, and academic literature on breaches legislation, and I elaborate my analysis by reasoning on the case of cloud computing. The analysis, which is frustrated by the lack of adequate data, shows that the regulatory framework on cyber security breaches may be failing to provide the necessary level of mutual learning on the functioning of security measures, awareness of both regulatory authorities and the public on how entities fare in protecting data (and the related network and information systems), and enforcing self-improvement of entities dealing with information and services. I conclude with some recommendations addressing the causes, rather than the symptoms, of network and information systems insecurity.",10.1016/j.clsr.2018.04.009,"Porcedda, Maria Grazia"

The research methodology chosen for these goals is a systematic literature review based on a structured, transparent, replicable multistage process. Thirty-six references have been found, which indicates the paucity of research studies in this field.

Europe's mining innovation trends and their contribution to the sustainable development goals: Blind spots and strong points,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.25879519649104304,"For millennia, mining was not only a source of great economic wealth, but also of social and environmental concern. It, therefore, was a focus of the business and public policy sustainable development agenda for many years. Thus, many international programmes, such as the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tried to capture this concept by developing frameworks to guide in their implementation by the mining sector. However, there is scarce knowledge about the mining sector's contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - the broadly accepted and politically legitimised post-2015 development agenda. This paper investigates the extent to which mining innovations that are employed, or that will be employed in the future, can make a contribution to achieving the SDGs in Europe. To this end, the authors identified current and future mining Innovation Concepts and challenges, as well as designed an SDG impact framework for identifying the impacts of innovation, concluding that almost all innovation concepts show repercussions on individual SDGs. This indicates that innovation concepts not only depict synergies between the SDGS, but also trade-offs or imbalances between individual SDGs. Further research is required on the overall environmental impact of technological innovations, the implications for absolute de-coupling of environmental impacts and economic performance, and the possibility of rebound effects.",10.1016/j.resourpol.2019.101440,"Endl, Andreas; Tost, Michael; Hitch, Michael; Moser, Peter; Feiel, Susanne"

What costs do migrants face? What are the impacts of migration on migrants and the economy? The literature paints a complex picture whereby rural-urban migration is driven by many factors and the returns to migration as well as the costs are very high. The evidence supports the notion that migration barriers hinder labor market adjustment and are likely to be welfare reducing.

Following the explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach, this study was completed in two phases. In the first phase, quantitative data was collected from 237 university librarians from across Pakistan. In the second phase, 10 purposefully selected university librarians were interviewed. The results reveal that Pakistani university libraries are using limited AI-based library services including text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, Google Assistant to search by voice command, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system for self-checkout, check-in, and security purposes, and intelligent data analysis for collection management. This study explored key factors that influence implementation of AI applications including highly integrated technological infrastructure, funding/cost associated with AI, collaboration between AI experts and professionals, and library users' feedback. The major identified challenges were the requirement of a highly networked and integrated environment, lack of budget, high cost of AI technologies, and lack of staff expertise. This study claims to implement the first comprehensive survey of AI applications in Pakistani university libraries at the national level.

"Opening up connectivity between documents, structures and bioactivity",2020,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.19613152008652215,"Bioscientists reading papers or patents strive to discern the key relationships reported within a document “D“ where a bioactivity “A” with a quantitative result “R” (e.g., an IC50) is reported for chemical structure “C” that modulates (e.g., inhibits) a protein target “P”. A useful shorthand for this connectivity thus becomes DARCP. The problem at the core of this article is that the community has spent millions effectively burying these relationships in PDFs over many decades but must now spend millions more trying to get them back out. The key imperative for this is to increase the flow into structured open databases. The positive impacts will include expanded data mining opportunities for drug discovery and chemical biology. Over the last decade commercial sources have manually extracted DARCP from ≈300,000 documents encompassing ≈7 million compounds interacting with ≈10,000 targets. Over a similar time, the Guide to Pharmacology, BindingDB and ChEMBL have carried out analogues DARCP extractions. Although their expert-curated numbers are lower (i.e., ≈2 million compounds against ≈3700 human proteins), these open sources have the great advantage of being merged within PubChem. Parallel efforts have focused on the extraction of document-to-compound (D-C-only) connectivity. In the absence of molecular mechanism of action (mmoa) annotation, this is of less value but can be automatically extracted. This has been significantly accomplished for patents, (e.g., by IBM, SureChEMBL and WIPO) for over 30 million compounds in PubChem. These have recently been joined by 1.4 million D-C submissions from three major chemistry publishers. In addition, both the European and US PubMed Central portals now add chemistry look-ups from abstracts and full-text papers. However, the fully automated extraction of DARCLP has not yet been achieved. This stands in contrast to the ability of biocurators to discern these relationships in minutes. Unfortunately, no journals have yet instigated a flow of author-specified DARCP directly into open databases. Progress may come from trends such as open science, open access (OA), findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), resource description framework (RDF) and WikiData. However, we will need to await the technical applicability in respect to DARCP capture to see if this opens up connectivity.",10.3762/bjoc.16.54,"Southan, Christopher"

Through an abductive study, we compare how these middle managers reason about their work with performance indicators to mobilise top managers towards an OI strategy. Findings show that the situational nuances middle managers find themselves in, such as the extent of strategic support for an OI strategy by top managers and the degree to which OI practices are adopted, plays a critical role in influencing how they work with performance indicators. According to these situational nuances, we distinguish different OI contexts which affect how middle managers reason about their work with performance indicators.

Artificial intelligence in financial services: a qualitative research to discover robo-advisory services,2021,-1,Outliers,0.13858520487898535,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to gauge the awareness and perception of Indian individual investors about a new fintech innovation known as robo-advisors in the wealth management scenario. Robo-advisors are comprehensive automated online advisory platforms that help investors in managing wealth by recommending portfolio allocations, which are based on certain algorithms. Design/methodology/approach This is a phenomenological qualitative study that used five focussed group discussions to gather the stipulated information. Purposive sampling was used and the sample comprised investors who actively invest in the Indian stock market. A semi-structured questionnaire and homogeneous discussions were used for this study. Discussion time for all the groups was 203 min. One of the authors moderated the discussions and translated the audio recordings verbatim. Subsequently, content analysis was carried out by using the NVIVO 12 software (QSR International) to derive different themes. Findings Factors such as cost-effectiveness, trust, data security, behavioural biases and sentiments of the investors were observed as crucial points which significantly impacted the perception of the investors. Furthermore, several suggestions on different ways to enhance the awareness levels of investors were brought up by the participants during the discussions. It was observed that some investors perceive robo-advisors as only an alternative for fund/wealth managers/brokers for quantitative analysis. Also, they strongly believe that human intervention is necessary to gauge the emotions of the investors. Hence, at present, robo-advisors for the Indian stock market, act only as a supplementary service rather than a substitute for financial advisors. Research limitations/implications Due to the explorative nature of the study and limited participants, the findings of the study cannot be generalised to the overall population. Future research is imperative to study the dynamic nature of artificial intelligence (AI) theories and investigate whether they are able to capture the sentiments of individual investors and human sentiments impacting the market. Practical implications This study gives an insight into the awareness, perception and opinion of the investors about robo-advisory services. From a managerial perspective, the findings suggest that additional attention needs to be devoted to the adoption and inculcation of AI and machine learning theories while building algorithms or logic to come up with effective models. Many investors expressed discontent with the current design of risk profiles of the investors. This helps to provide feedback for developers and designers of robo-advisors to include advanced and detailed programming to be able to do risk profiling in a more comprehensive and precise manner. Social implications In the future, robo-advisors will change the wealth management scenario. It is well-established that data is the new oil for all businesses in the present times. Technologies such as robo-advisor, need to evolve further in terms of predicting unstructured data, improvising qualitative analysis techniques to include the ability to gauge emotions of investors and markets in real-time. Additionally, the behavioural biases of both the programmers and the investors need to be taken care of simultaneously while designing these automated decision support systems. Originality/value This study fulfils an identified gap in the literature regarding the investors’ perception of new fintech innovation, that is, robo-advisors. It also clarifies the confusion about the awareness level of robo-advisors amongst Indian individual investors by examining their attitudes and by suggesting innovations for future research. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the awareness, perception and attitudes of individual investors towards robo-advisors.",10.1108/QRFM-10-2020-0199,"Bhatia, Ankita; Chandani, Arti; Atiq, Rizwana; Mehta, Mita; Divekar, Rajiv"
How to train supply managers – Necessary and sufficient purchasing skills leading to success,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"The success of purchasing and supply management (PSM) largely depends on PSM professionals' skills levels. Past research assumed that one universal PSM professional type exists, and they have proposed one-size-fits-all PSM skillsets. However, PSM professionals have different objectives. Based on the data of an extensive survey conducted amongst European PSM professionals (n = 366), this study presents skillsets for seven objectives (reducing costs and improving delivery, quality, sustainability, strategic competitive advantage, supplier satisfaction and innovation). A differentiation is made between “necessary” and “sufficient” conditions for each objective's effectiveness. Within a new PSM-skills taxonomy, a hierarchy of skills is detected as one of the first categories that provide quantitative evidence that soft skills or personal skills are necessary conditions for carrying out hard skills or professional skills.

SAARC super smart grid: Navigating the future - unleashing the power of an energy-efficient integration of renewable energy resources in the saarc region,2024,7,Topic_7_energy_power_data,1.0,"The major problems in the power system network of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region include the utilization of substantial fossil fuels, which leads to significant emissions of CO2. Moreover, due to the depletion of fossil fuels, it is very difficult to manage the demand requirement of the SAARC regions, which leads to significant power shortage issues. These problems would be resolved through the integration of the substantial amount of renewable energy resources (RERs) that are available in excess in the SAARC regions into the power system networks. This will provide a futuristic roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment in the SAARC region. In this regard, the SAARC region has devised a new plan to transform its smart grid infrastructure into the super smart grid (SSG), which would connect the SAARC countries using the high voltage transmission lines utilizing each country's substantial RERs. To accelerate this ecofriendly effort, the key objective of this review study is to evaluate the potential of the SAARC SSG for demand management and emissions reduction. This study provides a comprehensive overview of SSG technology, covering its technical background, management, power flow improvement techniques, power stability techniques, simulation models, and future steps for development in the SAARC region. First, the regional conflicts, energy deficiency, and potential of the SAARC region have been discussed. Second, a potential architecture of the SAARC SSG has been simulated. Third, a novel Markov chain modeling has been presented for demand management in the SAARC regions. The results and discussions section presents findings from simulations and models. The paper also discusses CO2 reduction techniques, including methods for capturing, storing, and utilizing carbon in biofuel. The study also discusses futuristic optimization techniques in SSG, including blockchain, federated learning, reinforcement learning, the metaverse, digital twin technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The SSG challenges and limitations section summarizes the challenges and limitations faced by SSG. Finally, a roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment for the SAARC power grids has been identified to support the implementation of the futuristic SAARC SSG.

Digital transformation: A review and research agenda,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"The ongoing and ubiquitous digital transformation challenges the raison d'être of firms and forces managers to rethink business strategies and operations and academics to reconsider related theories. To aid these efforts, we conduct a systematic review of research on firms' digital transformation, generating a database of 537 peer-reviewed academic articles and analyzing it using a novel multi-layered framework. The framework separates three layers: an organization's core activities, its peripheral activities, and its external environment. We find that firms that have come far in their transformations are more embedded in platform ecosystems with unclear business boundaries. Relatedly, we identify a tension between decentralizing versus centralizing power across organizational layers during a firm's digital transformation and how this dynamic affects corporate strategies and firms' internal and external boundaries.",10.1016/j.emj.2022.09.007,"Plekhanov, Dmitry; Franke, Henrik; Netland, Torbjørn H."
Exploring the enabling effects of project management for SMEs in adopting open innovation – A framework for partner search and selection in open innovation projects,2021,-1,Outliers,0.14437583790140057,"Open Innovation (OI) facilitates a multitude of innovation opportunities through allowing access to a broad variety of external partners, expertise and knowledge. Although OI has been established in academia and the corporate world, implementation by SMEs remains a formidable challenge, especially concerning the identification and selection of suitable OI partners. Given methodical support for such an endeavour is currently lacking, this article investigates how project management can support OI projects. Based on evidence from an exploratory multi-case study with four SMEs, this article develops a Situational Open Innovation framework that provides methodical support for SMEs in leveraging the complementarities between OI and project management towards effective partner search and selection. The findings illustrate how sensing capabilities for OI opportunities can benefit from systematic problem and stakeholder analyses as they allow for identifying and focussing on the most relevant innovation tasks and partners.",10.1016/j.ijproman.2020.06.007,"Guertler, Matthias Rudolf; Sick, Nathalie"
Experience constructing the Artifact Genome Project (AGP): Managing the domain's knowledge one artifact at a time,2018,-1,Outliers,0.07938355304736189,"While various tools have been created to assist the digital forensics community with acquiring, processing, and organizing evidence and indicating the existence of artifacts, very few attempts have been made to establish a centralized system for archiving artifacts. The Artifact Genome Project (AGP) has aimed to create the largest vetted and freely available digital forensics repository for Curated Forensic Artifacts (CuFAs). This paper details the experience of building, implementing, and maintaining such a system by sharing design decisions, lessons learned, and future work. We also discuss the impact of AGP in both the professional and academic realms of digital forensics. Our work shows promise in the digital forensics academic community to champion the effort in curating digital forensic artifacts by integrating AGP into courses, research endeavors, and collaborative projects.",10.1016/j.diin.2018.04.021,"Grajeda, Cinthya; Sanchez, Laura; Baggili, Ibrahim; Clark, Devon; Breitinger, Frank"
The techno-finance fix: A critical analysis of international and regional environmental policy documents and their implications for planning,2018,-1,Outliers,0.1442458243755979,"This article is concerned with the interaction of international, regional and national policy on climate change and sustainability, and the implications of these policy dimensions for planning. With the scientific consensus pointing to unequivocal human influence on the ecosystem, the issue of how best to manage climate change and ecological sustainability is arguably now a matter for economic, political, policy and planning domains. However, despite the warnings of scientists that ‘business as usual’ economic accumulation is no longer an option, this analysis of international and regional policy suggests that in the main, solutions are proffered that merely shift forms of capital accumulation and enforce ‘business as usual’, rather than providing transformative trajectories to plan for climate change adaptation and mitigation. This article traces key documents from an international level including United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, to EU regional policy, and sectoral policy at a sample national level. This is with a view to providing a theoretical backdrop, and a summary of selected relevant documentation that planners may be required to consider with respect to climate change issues. This article may therefore be considered in part, as a ‘map’ of the policy landscape for planners, highlighting the policy tensions and the conflicts that exist between international, regional and national levels of policymaking. These tensions largely lie between the areas of economic and ecological stability, and usually fail to reconcile contradictions between economic growth and protection of the ecosystem. The article introduces the concept of the ‘techno-finance fix’ to analyse and critique the dominant solutions to climate change. These solutions involve a dovetailing of a hope in emergent, new and not-yet-existing technologies, with a hope that the markets will fund the correct types of technological innovation deemed necessary to mitigate climate change. Therefore, the implications for planning involve an imperative to respond to climate change, and knowledge in the key aspects of climate change policy. However, the response at a planning level depends on which dominant narratives are being forwarded from the top down at a multi-layered policy level. This work therefore suggests that the ‘techno-finance fix’ is a dominant approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and that planning for climate change is thus informed by this dominant narrative, to the marginalising of alternative solutions, including those outside the market or technology.",10.1016/j.progress.2016.06.001,"Morgan, Trish"
An integrated process-based HSE management system: A case study,2021,8,Topic_8_data_big_big data,0.35562970240525266,"Nowadays, companies are not only focused on achieving goals such as cost savings and increasing efficiency and profitability, but are also making a great deal of effort to add other social and environmental goals to their agenda, often including concerns related to health, safety and the environment (HSE). To achieve their HSE goals, organizations are required to have the processes associated with HSE components designed and developed in a single system. However, the organizations dependence on software becomes evident when macro-level managerial decisions are made based on all the data entered and stored in the organizations’ systems such as procurement, logistics, manufacturing, maintenance, and other related systems all of which might be isolated and separated from each other. These systems may provide a variety of features for organizations, but the lack of integration between them makes it difficult to interact and collaborate with the other processes of the organization. Therefore, the critical point is the integration of these systems in a comprehensive enterprise software. This integration challenge is due to the interdependency and the complexity of the data transmission as well as the relationships among various parts of the organization. To shed some light on the integration complexities this paper is intended to propose an approach to tackle these issues by designing an integrated HSE system with all its processes, features, and connections through an industrial enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. To illustrate the applicability of the system in an industrial context, we conduct a case study of the implementation of this HSE system in the mining industry and closely scrutinize the integration-related challenges faced during this process of software analysis, development and deployment.",10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104993,"Hajipour, Vahid; Amouzegar, Hamidreza; Gharaei, Ali; Gholami Abarghoei, Mohammad Saeed; Ghajari, Sepideh"
What we know about management accountants’ changing identities and roles – a systematic literature review,2020,-1,Outliers,0.09135301055688863,"Purpose Academic interest in role changes of management accountants (MAs) has increased during the past two decades. Role changes imply identity reconstructions as they do not only require an external legitimacy, but professionals have to internalize a new role script. Thus, this paper aims to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing changes concerning MAs by providing an identity perspective. Design/methodology/approach This paper systematically reviews the literature on the changing role of MAs from an identity perspective, based on a conclusive sample of 64 articles. Findings This review identified several external factors such as professional associations and educational institutions as well as organizational and individual factors that impact MAs’ identity and act as change drivers. MAs’ identity is linked with their image in the public and within the organization and is challenged by increasing demands, conflicting expectations and technological progress. Hence, the literature sample illustrates a fragmented and contradictory picture regarding the changes of MAs’ identities and roles and displays that the idea of a simple movement from one identity to another is misleading. Furthermore, the identity perspective offers new issues for management accounting research, practice and education such as nested identity, multiple or desired identities. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to review the literature of MAs’ changing identities and roles from an identity perspective. This perspective enables a novel focus on internal views, perceptions and internalized meanings of MAs connected with their role instead of exclusively debating changed external behavior expectations.",10.1108/JAOC-02-2019-0025,"Wolf, Tanja; Kuttner, Michael; Feldbauer-Durstmüller, Birgit; Mitter, Christine"
Transition from building information modeling (BIM) to integrated digital delivery (IDD) in sustainable building management: A knowledge discovery approach based review,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.6260437611136924,"Over the past decade, building information modeling (BIM) and sustainability have attracted increased interest, with a concomitant rise in the number of related publications. However, research efforts made in BIM for sustainable building management, especially using in all four Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD) phases are minimal. Therefore, this study features a combined scientometric analysis and IDD thematic discussion examining 471 scholarly bibliographies accessed from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The purpose of this study is to statistically classify BIM-sustainability publications from 2007 to 2019 in order to understand the research status, key themes, trends, and future challenges to be addressed in the field of sustainable BIM. The most influential scholars, institutes, regions/countries, articles, and journals have been identified. Moreover, clustering analyses identified topics that sustainable BIM research tended to gravitate toward, such as cloud approaches, data sharing, life cycle energy efficiency, and informetric analysis. The top 100 most cited documents from WoS were also manually classified into four quadrants of IDD, namely design, fabrication, construction, and asset delivery and management. Ten BIM-sustainability phenomena were observed throughout the life cycle of IDD. Finally, key research gaps and important areas for future research in this field were identified. The clearly delineated clusters and themes provide a practical overview and a deeper understanding of the current research progress of IDD for building sustainability, highlighting the challenges and research gaps for future research.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125223,"Liu, Ziwen; Lu, Yujie; Shen, Meng; Peh, Lu Chang"
Attitude vs involvement: a systematic literature review at the intersection between engagement and innovation,2020,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.4087645918723967,"Purpose In a world where innovation became a “buzzword” and everyone within companies is required to foster innovation, the engagement of people toward innovation is fundamental to prompt individual motivation and actions to make innovation happen. However, despite the relevance of the relationship between engagement and innovation, the literature on the topic appears still fragmented. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the topic through a systematic literature review. Design/methodology/approach A final sample of 108 papers has been selected and analyzed through co-citation and text mining analyses. The former enabled the analysis of the structure of the theoretical foundation of the filed, while the latter facilitated a systematic and unbiased content-driven review of the literature. Findings The results of the analysis indicated two main areas of interest describing the relationship between engagement and innovation. On the one hand, there is the focus on “engagement as an attitude,” intended as the capacity of individuals to generate and realize innovation. On the other hand, there is a stream of literature focused on “engagement as involvement,” which refers to co-innovation paradigms, involving both internal and external stakeholders. Research limitations/implications From an academic perspective, this paper highlights the relevance of the “human-side” of innovation, proposing avenues for future research that dig into the relationship between people's engagement and innovation dynamics. Moreover, it shows how the recent developments in the innovation management literature are coherent with this emerging relevance of the human perspective in innovation. Practical implications From a practitioner’s perspective, this paper helps managers by highlighting the two different approaches that they can have in terms of engagement. The study aims to help them in identifying the kind of engagement they are looking for in their employees and other innovation stakeholder having the support to find relevant studies in that direction. Originality/value The study unveils how the evolution of both areas over the years is strictly related to the megatrends of innovation fields, which are the main areas of knowledge not covered yet.

Towards Human–Machine Collaboration in Creating an Evaluation Corpus for Adverse Drug Events in Discharge Summaries of Electronic Medical Records,2016,4,Topic_4_healthcare_health_data,0.358815755375748,"Adverse drug events (ADEs) contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in the healthcare system. The availability of digitalised hospitals' narrative clinical data offers a potentially rich resource to enhance pharmacovigilance efforts to manage potential safety issues arising from real-world use of drugs. The goal of this paper was to establish a foundation for creating an evaluation corpus by developing a set of annotation guidelines to achieve high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) and to evaluate the performance of basic entity identification tools for drugs, adverse events (AEs) and drug-AE relationships from 100 discharge summaries of a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Two teams of three annotators worked independently on text annotation using Knowtator. Three-way IAA of 86%, 70% and 49% were achieved for drugs, AEs and drug-AE relationships respectively. The performance of the machine algorithm was evaluated against annotations made by at least two annotators, with a recall of 84% and precision of 73% for drugs and a recall of 67% and precision of 53% for AEs. The high recall and precision for drug entity extraction suggests that machine pre-annotation of drugs followed by human annotation of AEs and drug-AE relationships could be a feasible approach in expediting the process of creating a larger evaluation corpus. Non-matches between machine and human annotations were examined to identify ways to further refine the algorithm. When successfully implemented, the identification of ADEs could greatly support pharmacovigilance work in characterising the magnitude and scope of ADEs and prioritising interventions to improve the drug safety.",10.1016/j.bdr.2016.04.001,"Ang, Pei San; Fan, Liza Y.P.; Tham, Mun Yee; Tan, Siew Har; Soh, Sally B.L.; Foo, Belinda P.Q.; Loke, Celine W.P.; Hu, Shangfeng; Sung, Cynthia"
The voluntary green behavior in green technology innovation: The dual effects of green human resource management system and leader green traits,2023,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.3021968595365269,"Green technology innovation is becoming increasingly important for companies to effectively address environmental governance, with employees’ green behaviors serving as core supportive carriers. Drawing on the sensemaking theory, this study uses a mixed-method design that involves quantitative surveys of 224 well-educated professionals working in different companies and qualitative multiple case studies of four companies engaged in green technology innovation in China. The purpose of this study is to investigate the complex relationships among the green human resource management system, leader green traits, and voluntary green behavior of employee, as well as to verify these relationships while further unfolding their underlying intrinsic mechanism. The results demonstrate that green human resource management system and leader pro-environmental attitude have a positive effect on the voluntary green behavior of employees, respectively. Leader moral reflectiveness has a moderating effect on the relationship between the green human resource management system and the voluntary green behavior of employees.

University library performance management: Applying zero-sum gains DEA models to resource allocation,2020,-1,Outliers,0.2005307251929866,"The management of university libraries faces major challenges in evaluating its performance since in many cases this assessment is performed inappropriately. One of the challenges is the lack of fair approaches to reallocate resources in university library systems. In this context, data envelopment analysis (DEA), a flexible technique that allows the use of multiple inputs and outputs to assess the performance of productive units, may prove useful. In DEA, in addition to the so-called classic models, there are the zero-sum gains (ZSG) models that, when used together, assist in resource allocation. This work aims to develop a powerful approach to help the manager to assess the performance of libraries as well as allow the reallocation of resources within an integrated library system of a university in Brazil. This two-step approach is based on the classic CCR model in the first stage and the ZSG CCR DEA (zero-sum gains data envelopment analysis CCR) model on the next stage, both oriented to inputs. The results show increases in the efficiency of libraries through the redistribution of resources. This approach is invaluable to the management of library systems since it provides an instrument for improving resource utilization.",10.1016/j.seps.2020.100808,"Bernardo, Marcella; de Souza, Matheus Alves Madeira; Moreira Lopes, Ramon Sávio; Rodrigues, Lásara Fabrícia"

Unfolding the digital servitization path from products to product-service-software systems: Practicing change through intentional narratives,2021,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,1.0,"Manufacturers are increasingly struggling with the transition from products to product-service-software systems. Our study takes stock of the current research on servitization and digital servitization to investigate the challenging transition process from product to more complex product-service-software systems. We examine how does the digital servitization journey unfold as sayings and doings, and how do intentional narratives guide digital servitization. The present in-depth single case study spanning 8 years reveals the emergent process during the transition of a leading solution provider from servitization to digital servitization. The study uses social practices, such as managers' sayings and doings, to map the change process that unfolds first as servitization and, in a second stage, as digital servitization. Even more importantly, this study unpacks the role of intentional narratives in shaping digital servitization as a lengthy change process. For managers, this study provides a detailed depiction of the servitization and digital servitization processes, and some intentional narratives for guiding the process.

Effective contracting for high operational performance in projects,2019,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.9370780409997229,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine combinations of contract clauses in order to ascertain which combinations correlate to high operational performance (OP). Design/methodology/approach Two hypotheses were formulated from contracting theory and tested on data collected from 45 projects. Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis was used and validated with multiple regression and simulation. Findings The hypotheses were tested to determine whether combinations of classical, relational, and/or associational contract clauses correlate to high OP. The results show that whereas high OP correlates to combinations of relational and associational contract clauses, classical and relational clauses should not be combined. Research limitations/implications Directions are proposed to guide future research in order to produce a more nuanced testing of contractual complementarity. Practical implications The managerial implications of the findings include a more thorough understanding of the use of contract clauses and of which clauses managers should combine to achieve high OP. Originality/value This study contributes to the theory of contractual incompleteness and complementarity, specifically in the context of project contracting. The analysis produced two theoretical implications: first, that better performing contracts are created when combining relational and associational contract clauses; and second, that in projects, relational and classical contract clauses are not complementary with regards to realizing high OP.",10.1108/IJOPM-10-2017-0604,"Kapsali, Maria; Roehrich, Jens K.; Akhtar, Pervaiz"
Regulating data intermediaries: The impact of the Data Governance Act on the EU's data economy,2023,2,Topic_2_protection_privacy_law,1.0,"As part of the European Commission's broader data strategy, the Data Governance Act (“DGA”) introduces a new regulatory regime for data intermediaries, which, inter alia, pursues the objective of increasing the competitiveness of the European data economy by bolstering trust in data-sharing mechanisms. Against this backdrop, we introduce data intermediaries and critically examine the DGA's related legal regime by testing its underlying assumptions and highlighting its intrinsic weaknesses and limitations as part of the broader EU data law puzzle. As a result, the paper brings to the fore certain contradictions between DGA's means and ends. Indeed, due to various questionable assumptions, the DGA imposes requirements that not all data intermediaries can satisfy and entrenches a specific techno-organisational form for data intermediation services that may turn out to be economically non-viable. Consequently, one must wonder whether the DGA's rules on data intermediaries are necessary and proportionate in light of the freedom to conduct a business. We furthermore uncover inconsistencies and loopholes between the DGA, the GDPR, the draft Data Act, and the Digital Markets Act. Overall, while the DGA's underlying efforts are laudable, its precise postulations may hinder the achievement of its underlying objectives due to two main factors. First its own internal limitations and incoherences, and, second, uncertainties and tensions resulting from its interplay with the broader EU data law framework.",10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105830,"Carovano, Gabriele; Finck, Michèle"
Fifty years of multiple criteria decision analysis: From classical methods to robust ordinal regression,2025,9,Topic_9_digital_innovation_literature,0.7360885144344704,"Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a subfield of Operational Research that aims to support Decision-Makers (DMs) in the decision-making process through mathematical models and computational procedures. In this perspective, MCDA employs structured and traceable protocols to identify potential actions and the criteria for evaluating them. MCDA procedures aim to define recommendations consistent with the preferences of DMs for the specific decision problem at hand. These problems are generally formulated in terms of either choosing the best action, classifying actions into pre-defined and ordered decision classes, or ranking actions from best to worst. As the evaluation criteria are generally conflicting, the main challenge is to aggregate them into a mathematical preference model representing the DM value system. We review the development of MCDA over the past fifty years and describe its evolution with examples of distinctive methods. They are distinguished by the type of preference information elicited by DMs, the type of the preference model (criteria aggregation), and the way of converting the preference relation induced by the preference model in the set of potential actions into a decision recommendation. We focus on MCDA methods with a finite set of actions. References to specific application areas will be given.

The influence of contrasting values on consumer receptiveness to ethical information and ethical choices,2019,-1,Outliers,0.19928792201601744,"Ethical consumption is more likely when consumers are receptive to ethical product information and consider such information when making purchasing decisions. Building on communication theory, we develop and test a framework illustrating how different consumer values induce contrasting effects on consumers' willingness to choose ethical products through affecting consumer receptiveness to ethical product information. We present an online survey with 590 US consumers, which was analyzed with covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). Results show that altruistic and biospheric consumer values increase consumers' willingness to choose ethical products via trust in ethical advertising and ethical purchase decision involvement. In contrast, egoistic consumer values reduce ethical purchase decision involvement, and ultimately consumers' willingness to choose ethical products. Thus, we illustrate the mechanisms through which contrasting values take effect. Results are discussed in light of theoretical and managerial implications and reemphasize the need for better adaptation of ethical marketing to individual consumer characteristics.",10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.07.022,"Osburg, Victoria-Sophie; Akhtar, Pervaiz; Yoganathan, Vignesh; McLeay, Fraser"
