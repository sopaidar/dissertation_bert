However, most of these IoT devices are easy to hack and compromise. Typically, these IoT devices are limited in compute, storage, and network capacity, and therefore they are more vulnerable to attacks than other endpoint devices such as smartphones, tablets, or computers. In this paper, we present and survey major security issues for IoT. We review and categorize popular security issues with regard to the IoT layered architecture, in addition to protocols used for networking, communication, and management. We outline security requirements for IoT along with the existing attacks, threats, and state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, we tabulate and map IoT security problems against existing solutions found in the literature. More importantly, we discuss, how blockchain, which is the underlying technology for bitcoin, can be a key enabler to solve many IoT security problems. The paper also identifies open research problems and challenges for IoT security.', 'The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm refers to the network of physical objects or ""things"" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data with servers, centralized systems, and/or other connected devices based on a variety of communication infrastructures. IoT data collected from different sensors, nodes and collectors are transferred to the cloud over the internet. IoT devices are used by consumers, healthcare, businesses as well as by the governments. It is being forecast that 31 billion IoT devices will be deployed all over the world by the year 2020. As the use of IoT devices is increasing every moment several IoT vulnerabilities are introduced.

Instead of looking at historic Bitcoin transactions, analysts can now examine Bitcoin activity in real-time using a powerful Bitcoin network visualization chart showing key connections, combined with a dedicated Bitcoin timeline view featuring precise transaction details as they occur. We conducted a thorough and quantitative assessment of 76 analytics tools, including those proposed in academic research and those endorsed by professionals and blockchain enthusiasts online, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the facets of blockchain data that have been thoroughly investigated. We also identified areas that warrant further exploration in future research.', 'It has been a decade since the formation of the first cryptocurrency in the world. Bitcoin was The first ever crypto invented by Satoshi Nag moto in 2008. It is a digital currency or virtual currency which is not controlled by the central government and operates without a central bank or single administrator. Block chain technology is used in the cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency block chain is the chain of the blocks, where each block contains a hash of the preceding block till the top block of the chain. A network gets formed by the blocks where block chain represents a public ledger of the transaction happened in the network. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen a rise in the attention of different sectors in the last few years. It has been in the eyes of everyone for the perks. It offers to be comparable to a fiat currency structure of banking sector, stakeholders, government and individual investors. Although research and awareness about cryptocurrencies or digital currency are very less and it is on the initial stage, this paper provides an important look and guide about the different aspects of cryptocurrency. The authenticity of this paper is on the discussion at various intervals of law and regulation with the consumption of high energy, possibility of crash collisions and security threat on the network attacks. The relative observations on future of applications of bitcoin can be seen throughout the paper.', 'As a method of exchange, cryptocurrency, which is a digital version of money made possible by a system called “blockchain technology,” functions very similarly to the fiat currency that it is based on. A cryptocurrency is also referred to as payment tokens, crypto tokens, electronic money, cyber money, virtual products, and virtual assets. These are all different names for the same thing. Because of the proliferation of cryptocurrency usage, it is now feasible to engage in direct monetary transactions, so sidestepping the need for conventional monetary authorities such as banks and governments to be involved. Bitcoin was the first kind of digital currency that existed only in the online world. This is the ultimate effect of dispersing operating expenses, which is a common strategy used by financial organizations in order to maximize their revenues. Cryptography is a tried-and-tested method that may be used to protect sensitive information from being seen by unauthorized parties. When sending data via a secure encryption method, the information must first be encrypted. The name given to the decentralized peer-to-peer network that Bitcoin uses is “blockchain.” The primary objective of this change is to make it more difficult to spend money twice. The fact that neither the server nor the administration is centralized lends credence to the theory that the system in question is decentralized. Only businesses and members of the general public are able to independently validate the value of these currencies.

To store a patient’s medical history (including diagnoses and treatments), medical history (including diagnostic pictures), and financial data (including demographics and insurance details), a computerised database known as an “Electronic Health Record” (EHR) is used. Because medical records are typically private and must be shielded from prying eyes, ensuring their secure transfer is a top priority for healthcare systems. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in the proposed study to ensure the security of all sent medical data, including the Chest X-ray MedPix images. This article describes a blockchain-based solution that patients can use to keep all their data in one secure location. This system was built with the Ganache tool on the Ethereum network, making use of Solidity and web3.js as well as other languages, tools, and approaches. In this study, a systematic method is described wherein blockchain smart contracts are used to record patient information and execute tasks in a distributed environment. After a smart contract has been deployed, all transactional communication occurs within its encrypted confines, protecting both the parties and their personal information. As an added bonus, the validated and broadcasted changes intended by the transaction can be checked. To ensure that government agencies have quick access to protected records, there is a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) that stores the information in an encrypted, decentralised manner. Both patients and physicians can use the wallet to log in. In addition, the system will manage and protect all of the doctor and patient’s information. Things like the following are in scope for the proposed system: Users may now access the same information at the same time because to blockchain’s distributed ledger capabilities, which boosts productivity, establishes trust, and lowers barriers to entry. Setting individual permissions for users allows for safe data storage. In addition, the suggested method enables the safe transmission of patient medical records.', 'Background Medical referral is the transfer of a patient’s care from one physician to another upon request. This process involves multiple steps that require provider-to-provider and provider-to-patient communication. In Taiwan, the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) has implemented a national medical referral (NMR) system, which encourages physicians to refer their patients to different health care facilities to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and the financial stress on the national health insurance. However, the NHIA’s NMR system is a government-based electronic medical referral service, and its referral data access and exchange are limited to authorized clinical professionals using their national health smart cards over the NHIA virtual private network. Therefore, this system lacks scalability and flexibility and cannot establish trusting relationships among patients, family doctors, and specialists. Objective To eliminate the existing restrictions of the NHIA’s NMR system, this study developed a scalable, flexible, and blockchain-enabled framework that leverages the NHIA’s NMR referral data to build an alliance-based medical referral service connecting health care facilities. Methods We developed a blockchain-enabled framework that can integrate patient referral data from the NHIA’s NMR system with electronic medical record (EMR) and electronic health record (EHR) data of hospitals and community-based clinics to establish an alliance-based medical referral service serving patients, clinics, and hospitals and improve the trust in relationships and transaction security. We also developed a blockchain-enabled personal health record decentralized app (DApp) based on our blockchain-enabled framework for patients to acquire their EMR and EHR data; DApp access logs were collected to assess patients’ behavior and investigate the acceptance of our personal authorization-controlled framework. Results The constructed iWellChain Framework was installed in an affiliated teaching hospital and four collaborative clinics. The framework renders all medical referral processes automatic and paperless and facilitates efficient NHIA reimbursements. In addition, the blockchain-enabled iWellChain DApp was distributed for patients to access and control their EMR and EHR data. Analysis of 3 months (September to December 2018) of access logs revealed that patients were highly interested in acquiring health data, especially those of laboratory test reports. Conclusions This study is a pioneer of blockchain applications for medical referral services, and the constructed framework and DApp have been applied practically in clinical settings. The iWellChain Framework has the scalability to deploy a blockchain environment effectively for health care facilities; the iWellChain DApp has potential for use with more patient-centered applications to collaborate with the industry and facilitate its adoption.', ""The healthcare industry stands to benefit greatly from blockchain technology due to its robust security, privacy protection, confidentiality, and decentralized nature. This study outlines how blockchain can revolutionize current medical data systems and proposes a framework for its implementation. The primary objective of this framework is to ensure secure storage of electronic records by establishing comprehensive access protocols for users. When patients seek medical care, hospitals generate and store patient records in a decentralized application (DApp), which is a blockchain- based platform for maintaining electronic medical records. Medical professionals can modify patient records, while patients can retrieve their medical information from the DApp using public keys. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) allow healthcare providers to monitor information necessary for compliance with insurance companies and government regulations. EHRs serve as a centralized data repository for storing doctors' orders related to laboratory tests, x-rays, and other diagnostic procedures. The proposed system aims to optimize individual medical information management, minimize redundant testing, reduce treatment delays, and equip patients with adequate information to make informed decisions.""]",4.72

In this regard, the importance of a Government Fund Policy (GFP) has been emphasized to promote recycling and remanufacturing efforts aimed at establishing T&A closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs). Simultaneously, blockchain technology and green-product design have transformed T&A brand marketing dynamics due to their crucial roles in enhancing brand trust and increasing market demand. Nevertheless, there is limited research dedicated to examine the interactive effects of GFP and blockchain technology within T&A supply chains. This paper proposes a stylized CLSC game involving a T&A manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer sells new and remanufactured T&A products to the retailer while determining green-product design efforts (i.e., green degree). The retailer determines selling prices but incurs usage costs associated with adopting blockchain technology. Through equilibrium analyses, we find that the simultaneous implementation of GFP and blockchain technology can incentivize T&A manufacturers to enhance the green degree of their products, thereby improving brand trust and market demand. All supply chain agents can benefit from adopting blockchain technology as long as its usage cost is below a threshold level, regardless of whether GFP is implemented or not. Similarly, irrespective of whether blockchain technology is adopted or not, if the ratio between remanufacturing subsidies and environmental taxes exceeds a specific threshold value, GFP will serve as an incentive for sustainability efforts among T&A firms while providing them with greater advantages. Additionally, the simultaneous implementation of GFP and blockchain technology holds significant potential for mitigating environmental pollution, i.e., by carefully selecting appropriate degrees of GFP and blockchain technology parameters, a mutually beneficial outcome can be achieved for T&A firms, consumers, and the environment. These findings have important implications for T&A supply chain managers seeking to optimize CLSCs while integrating blockchain technology. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights into government strategies for implementing GFPs.', 'With the pace of urbanization accelerating, smart cities are the newest concept, which will employ modern-day technology to bring about changes for the citizens and ensuring sustainable environmental practices. Another critical issue that arises in urbanization areas is the management of solid waste. Such advanced integrated IoT and ML technologies will be applied to develop highly efficient eco-friendly practical solutions for waste minimization, product remanufacturing, reuse and recycling in the Smart Cities. IoT sensors are deployed across the waste collection points, thus quite a huge amount of data is provided concerning waste generation patterns, bin fill levels, environmental conditions, etc. Using Machine Learning many algorithms are in place for processing this data and adjusting predictive analysis for waste accumulation and optimizing waste collection schedules. As well as that, ML models are used to identify the recyclable materials that are to use for recycling purposes in which it improves the sorting processes and activity. As well, this article examines the policy of remanufacturing, it specifically concentrates on the conversion of the worn out and to a large extent unusable products and recycling materials into new high quality materials. A significant advantage is that advanced tools for IoT monitoring will allow for smooth operations and the minimization of energy waste throughout the course of materials remanufacturing. On the one end, the reuse is ensured by smart platforms that enable how people can reused the existing things by re-circulating them within the community hence reduced new products demand and waste generation. Utilizing the business model of ML algorithms, these platforms will make sure that supply and demand gets a match in an efficient way that interlinks the city as a whole circular economy. Furthermore, the paper presents the use of blockchain for supporting visibility and stock tracking in the recycling supply chain. Through immutable registration of transactions and recycling procedure, blockchain guarantees authenticity of recycled products and most importantly gives incentives to the responsible practices of waste disposal. The offered measures not only serve to waste reduction but also help to increase the environmental cleanliness and develop the economy of Smart Cities. Through internet of things and learning machines application, cities can get promising cuts in waste, put into practical use circular economy principles, and leave with cleaner and healthier urban environment.

In this complex landscape, Supply Chains (SCs) face challenges in building trust and avoiding greenwashing accusations. Blockchain technology offers a promising solution by ensuring transparency and circularity within SCs, particularly in identifying customers for product recycling. This study pioneers the exploration of consumers' distrust in pricing and product greenness, alongside the impact of carbon policies (taxes and subsidies) within a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). Using classical Stackelberg game theory, we develop two models that identify equilibrium decisions for SC members, focusing on pricing, green production investment, circularity, and blockchain adoption. Additionally, we propose an evolutionary game theory model to find the optimal government policies and identify the long-term behaviour of the CLSC and government in two heterogeneous populations. Our findings reveal that if the retailer's share of blockchain costs falls below a certain threshold, blockchain adoption becomes less profitable than exclusive investment in green production. A higher (lower) subsidy rate benefits (harms) the retailer but disadvantages (benefits) the collector. Blockchain adoption is generally more profitable for manufacturers and retailers, though less so for collectors, and it also drives greater investment in green production. While subsidies encourage blockchain adoption, they are not a sustainable long-term strategy for governments. Ultimately, the evolutionarily stable strategy for SCs involves a balanced investment in both green production and blockchain or green production alone, depending on market characteristics and cost-sharing structures.""]",4.39

The study proposes a robust solution by combining blockchain technology with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to enhance security, transparency, and traceability in the food industry. By integrating a web-based verification tool with the Ethereum blockchain, the system establishes a tamper-proof, decentralized ledger that meticulously tracks the origin of products. A comprehensive web application is developed to facilitate product authentication through QR code technology. Key stakeholders, including the central government (CG), state governments (SG), and district-level Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), utilize this platform to verify product authenticity at every stage of the supply chain, ensuring high data integrity and transparency. The system enables the central government, state governments, and APMCs to interact with the blockchain by adding their respective transaction blocks without modifying others' blocks. Contracts for each of these entities are developed and implemented, with Ganache utilized for local testing on a private network. The user interface, designed using React, leverages Web3.js to facilitate interactions with the Ethereum blockchain, MetaMask serves as the wallet for accessing the blockchain, with Ganache accounts imported for seamless integration. The CG logs in to generate a Quick Response(QR) code for each product and enters relevant product information. The SG scans the QR code to verify the product's authenticity and ensure it meets standards. The district APMC conducts the final verification, checking that the product's supply chain history aligns with its physical location. Blockchain technology improves counterfeit detection by providing a secure and transparent record of product provenance."", 'Recent incidents of food fraud and growing concerns about sustainability in food production have led to increased consumer preference for food traceability. Governments, responsible for enforcing food traceability regulations and overseeing food systems, play a crucial role in this context. Consequently, trust in government could significantly influence consumer behaviour and their valuation of food traceability systems. Blockchain (BC) technology, recently implemented in food traceability, has gained popularity due to its potential to create a “trustless” trust environment. This study aims to understand how consumers with varying levels of trust in the government value BC-based traceability systems. An online choice experiment (n\xa0=\xa0707) focused on Greek feta cheese was conducted to explore this relationship. Four consumer segments were identified, profiled, and labelled as Engaged, Sceptic, Vigilant, and Reliant. The findings reveal that consumers with low trust in government and a high tendency to seek product information place a high value on BC-based food traceability compared to other labelling schemes. Conversely, consumers who trust the government and do not actively seek product information show a preference for the well-known PDO certification over food traceability labels. These results highlight the potential for promoting BC-based traceability among consumers, as a sizeable segment demonstrates interest in such traceable products.', 'The global food sector is facing challenges such as eroded consumer trust, increased food safety risks, and growing sustainability concerns. This paper examines how blockchain technology can serve as a promising solution to these issues by providing transparency and traceability throughout the entire food supply chain. Numerous food safety incidents have significantly diminished consumer confidence, posing risks to public health and the economy. By implementing blockchain technology, data integrity and credibility can be ensured, ultimately enhancing consumer trust in the supply chain. This review explores the application of blockchain in various sectors, including dairy, meat, fresh produce, and fish supply chains, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing issues of contamination and fraud. Despite challenges related to scalability, security, and regulation, it is essential to overcome these obstacles to fully realize the potential benefits of blockchain for creating a reliable and sustainable global food supply chain. Furthermore, integrating blockchain with technologies such as RFID, AI, IoT, 3D printing, and big data can optimize tracking and quality control.

Furthermore, the case study findings identified three patterns: top management support and organizational readiness are enablers for blockchain adoption, and large companies are more likely to adopt blockchain than small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors explain these patterns by examining the nature of blockchain and the characteristics of Ireland as a developed country. Practical and scientific contributions are also presented. Research limitations/implications This study makes several important scientific contributions. First, the findings revealed that top management support and organizational readiness are significant enablers of blockchain adoption. Ireland is recognized as a technology developed country; however, the findings in relation to top management support contradict existing IT adoption literature pertaining to developed countries. Second, previous IT innovation adoption literature suggests that organizations size has a positive influence on a company’s IT innovation adoption process. This study demonstrates that large organizations are more likely to not only adopt blockchain but are also more likely to conduct increased levels of blockchain research and development activities. Finally, and most significantly, the authors identified several patterns, which relate specifically to Ireland as a developed country that influenced the findings. These findings could hold particular relevance to governments and organizations of other developed countries in terms of accelerating blockchain adoption. Practical implications The findings about the low level of blockchain awareness and the lack of information pertaining to viable business use cases indicate that the Irish government could play a more significant role in promoting the benefits of blockchain technologies. Further, the findings could also encourage IT providers to formulate enhanced strategies aimed at disseminating information pertaining to blockchain technologies. Second, the positive influence of top management support and organizational readiness, particularly about core competencies, on blockchain adoption suggests that equipping managers with the requisite knowledge and skills will be crucial in adopting these IT innovations. Finally, organizations who adopted blockchain used cloud-based blockchain platforms and tools to overcome the constraints of their initial low levels of organizational readiness. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to identify specific TOE blockchain adoption factors. Further, the authors examine how the three most identified organizational adoption factors impact organizations decisions to adopt blockchain. Finally, the authors discuss how the resulting three patterns identified by examining the nature of blockchain and the characteristics of Ireland as a technology developed country.']",4.17

Throughout recent years, conventional votes have pleased neither people nor government authorities. They are not entirely safe since ballots are simple to strike. It also challenges voter safety and transparency. Additionally, counting the votes takes too long. Modification of voting worldwide is an intriguing issue in current voting system. To solve these problems Digital technology is used in the voting phase for citizens in many nations. Digitalisation alone can not fix the issues fully. There are also many ways of manipulating or modifying digital technology and hindering voting. There should be fairness, independence and impartiality in the voting method. By analyzing the aforementioned problems, this research work combines the digitalisation with the blockchain technology to provide a voting mechanism. The main goals of our voting mechanism are to provide integrity, anonymity, privacy, and security of voters. With the use of markle tree and fingerprint hash, the data integrity and anonymity, privacy, security of the voters has been achieved in our proposed digital voting systems."", 'A widespread mistrust towards the traditional voting system has made democratic voting in any country very critical. People have seen their fundamental rights being violated. Other digital voting systems have been challenged due to a lack of transparency. Most voting systems are not transparent enough; this makes it very difficult for the government to gain voters’ trust. The reason behind the failure of the traditional and current digital voting system is that it can be easily exploited. The primary objective is to resolve problems of the traditional and digital voting system, which include any kind of mishap or injustice during the process of voting. Blockchain technology can be used in the voting system to have a fair election and reduce injustice. The physical voting systems have many flaws in it as well as the digital voting systems are not perfect enough to be implemented on large scale. This appraises the need for a solution to secure the democratic rights of the people. This article presents a platform based on modern technology blockchain that provides maximum transparency and reliability of the system to build a trustful relationship between voters and election authorities. The proposed platform provides a framework that can be implemented to conduct voting activity digitally through blockchain without involving any physical polling stations. Our proposed framework supports a scalable blockchain, by using flexible consensus algorithms. The Chain Security Algorithm applied in the voting system makes the voting transaction more secure. Smart contracts provide a secure connection between the user and the network while executing a transaction in the chain. The security of the blockchain based voting system has also been discussed. Additionally, encryption of transactions using cryptographic hash and prevention of attack 51% on the blockchain has also been elaborated. Furthermore, the methodology for carrying out blockchain transactions during the process of voting has been elaborated using Blockchain Finally, the performance evaluation of the proposed system shows that the system can be implemented in a large-scale population.', 'Due to the impact of the pandemic and globalization, many governments worldwide have begun to replace paper voting with electronic voting systems. This is primarily intended to increase voting efficiency and reduce personnel costs. However, electronic voting is usually centralized, which creates difficulties in ensuring the integrity of the voting process and protecting voter privacy. As a solution, we propose an efficient and anonymous web3-based voting system that provides incentives. The use of blockchain technology ensures that voting results are stored in a decentralized manner, reducing the possibility of tampering and ensuring vote integrity. To protect voter privacy, our system incorporates stealth addresses to conceal ballot content and lightweight ring signatures to verify voter validity without the risk of double voting. Furthermore, our voting system utilizes smart contracts to encourage voting and self-tallying, resulting in improved transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms several existing e-voting systems, thus providing a robust and secure alternative for governments seeking to improve their voting systems.']",3.28

Therefore, various governments have begun enforcing use of renewable energy to meet the rising electricity demands. Due to environmental and resiliency benefits, distributed energy resources are a potential solution for meeting future electricity demand. Combining the flow of the energy along with networks forms the Energy Internet. The survey provides a concise review of smart grid, blockchain architecture and their role in distributed energy trading. Solar energy has been the primary focus as the renewable energy resource for implementation purposes. Smart grid ensures an efficient distribution of the power, hold low losses, maintain degree of quality, and the safety of power supply. Such a setup has nodes including power sources and arrangements for transferring power to other nodes as well. It has various parameters that are of primary concern like power supply control, power flow execution, limiting the electricity as per the top layer transactions with help of monitoring devices, etc. Microcontrollers are responsible for interacting with the network and accessing data on it. Blockchain technology has been largely confined to finance and cryptocurrency. Recently, the technology has emerged as a distributed ledger technology which allows exchanges among participants without the need for a central market entity. The blockchain gives immutability of the transactions, which make sure each transaction among peers will be executed. It additionally gives immutability to transaction history, which may be used for audit or fixing a transaction dispute. Transaction executions are performed using smart contracts. Synchronization of the logical and physical layer between a pair of nodes forms the crux of the survey.', 'The real time Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading have ameliorated the smart city environment. Electric Vehicles (EVs) in smart cities have made it possible to balance the energy demand and supply without burdening the power grids. They also help in minimizing both the heap amounts of pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions. EVs not only charge their batteries from Charging Stations (CSs), but when the smart city faces energy deficiency, they supply their surplus energy to the power grids to fulfill energy demand as well. In addition, EVs also balance the energy demand and supply through energy trading at the local level during peak hours, which strengthens V2V energy trading. However, some issues, such as security threats and privacy leakage prevent EVs from participating in the energy trading process. In addition, the lack of incentives and knowledge about the cost of reaching the energy trading place within minimum time are also big challenges. Therefore, to solve the aforementioned challenges, a secure and efficient scheme for V2V and V2G energy trading is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme also helps in promoting environmental friendliness and making the smart cities sustainable and reliable. In the proposed scheme, energy trading transactions are secured using consortium blockchain, wherein the Local Aggregators (LAGs) are selected as authorized nodes. LAGs perform their role as energy brokers and are responsible for validating the energy trading requests using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. Moreover, a solution to find accurate distance with required expenses and time to reach the charging destination is also proposed, which effectively guides EVs to reach the relevant CSs and encourages energy trading. Besides, we propose a fair payment mechanism using a smart contract to avoid financial irregularities. An incentive provisioning mechanism is also given in the proposed work to prevent EVs from acting selfishly. The efficient power flow having minimized losses in the vehicular network is of much importance. Therefore, the energy losses incurred in both V2G and V2V are discussed in this work. Furthermore, Oyente is used for smart contract’s security analysis and for testing Ethereum’s resilience against different security flaws. Two attacker models are proposed and the security analyses of the models are also provided. The analyses show that the proposed system is robust against the double spending and Sybil attacks. Finally, the efficient performance of our proposed scheme is validated and analyzed. The simulation results proved that our proposed work outperforms existing work in terms of providing a secure and efficient energy trading platform for both V2G and V2V environments.', ""The proposed system develops a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading-based Local Energy Market (LEM) solution which optimizes distributed energy resources (DERs). The blockchain-based trading platform allows secure and transparent P2P energy trading in a grid-connected power network. In the P2P network, a participant with a surplus of renewable energy (such as solar photovoltaic (PV)) can trade excess with any other participants with an energy deficit. However, in business-as-usual (BAU), it has been fed back to the power grid or curtailed - which can be extremely costly to the grid. The energy traded through solar PV and battery energy storage system (BESS) via P2P trading is cheaper than the respective tariff of the grid.The main aim of the LEM is to mitigate power outages and accelerate the transition to clean energy through increased rooftop solar PV installation by motivating consumers and prosumers to invest in DERs. The LEM implements a marketplace for optimizing distributed energy resources (DERs). In doing so, the LEM can minimize lost energy from existing DER capacity, provide a financial incentive to generate renewable energy beyond the site it is generated at, and improve the savings and profits compared to a BAU case. Simplified, a LEM provides participants with cheaper, greener, and more reliable energy. The LEM maximizes a participant's yield from their solar PV panels, increasing the investment's profitability.Due to the benefits provided, implementing LEM accelerates renewable energy deployment with no government incentives. These benefits are achieved by utilizing a low-energy, high-speed proprietary Blockchain in tandem with the microservice-based architecture used in the software, which develops a secure trading network that is both easily scalable and highly resilient.""]",3.06

Therefore, the prevention and control of infectious diseases that have the potential of becoming global threats is a central priority of public health. However, the silent emergence and uncontrolled global spread of the novel virus called SARS-Cov-2 has proven that neither governments nor healthcare systems are prepared to respond to a pandemic. As an example, the coming of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has not only disrupted economies and collapsed healthcare systems, but also filled hospitals and separated people from their families and work across the globe. While the outbreak originated in China, the pandemic's epicenter moved to the US, which has more cases than any country in the world (New York accounted for nearly more than one-third of the country's coronavirus infections). As the US continues to adapt its response to the evolving situation of the virus, the nation's coronavirus pandemic has highlighted many practical uses for blockchain-based applications. Motivated by this, we present a solution for fighting the coronavirus outbreak - and future pandemic outbreaks - in the US using IOTA and QR code technology.

The system is built on the IOTA tangle platform and provides users detailed, unchangeable, and easy access to their personal information. CoviReader handles authentication, confidentiality, transparency and data sharing (with crucial considerations when revising confidential information).

However, at the same time, various security threats arise due to insecure communication happening among various entities in an IoV-based smart city deployment. To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool.

The fundamentals of governance are one such paradigm. As society's values have shifted, so have expectations of government shifted from the traditional model to something commonly referred to as `open governance'. Though a disputed term, we take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates openness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of open governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet, that are crucial. These technologies enable access to both the data and to engagement activities between citizens and government.

Zimbabwe has no electronic system for keeping land registry records. Developing a system that automates, and keeps the land registry records immutable, is possible by creating a blockchain system that stores all the transactions made during the process. The immutability nature of blockchain offers plenty of security features that will protect the system from hacking and other malpractices from intruders. It uses strong cryptographic protocols and standards to secure the records stored in a block of data thus making it more reliable for the land registry to transfer the land ownership from a seller to a new buyer. This paper presents a system based on a Hyperledger Fabric distributed ledger that will record, store real-time transactions made during the process of land registration, thus decreasing the cases of fraud as immutable transactions are being stored in the permissioned distributed ledger network.', 'The paper develops a blockchain-enabled framework for stool land acquisition in Ghana that makes it possible for parties with interest in lands to object to their sale if the transaction is being conducted on their blind side. The framework also makes it possible for potential land buyers to authenticate in real-time the ownership status of the land they want to acquire–whether the property is registered with the Lands Commission or has been deregistered from the Commission’s records. The framework is a response to Ghana’s current opaque and weakly coordinated land administration systems flourishing the phenomenon of multiple sale of same lands and other land tenure security problems in the country. Further to providing a blockchain-enabled stool lands acquisition framework that enhances transparency, accountability, and better land records keeping in Ghana, the paper takes issues with the view widely held in international development, government, judicial, and some academic circles that titling or lease registration is the only or primary viable means of securing land rights. Our findings from Ghana show that in addition to creating predatory economies for powerful land sector actors (e.g., chiefs and land administrators) to extort outrageous sums of money from land buyers, the heavy emphasis on land titling or lease registration undermines efforts at strengthening other less cumbersome, less costly and less corruption-laden aspects of land administration to improve property rights in the land sector.', 'Land Registration is a use case which involves lot of middlemen and central authorities in the process which then puts trust in the system. Keeping traces of who owns which part of land is challenging when there are hundreds or thousands of land records to maintain. Using Blockchain will remove the middlemen in the system and also will reduce corruption and increase speed of the process. Land Registration is a simple decentralized application which is build using the Ethereum Blockchain principals. We can use this registration procedure as an substitute to bypass the existing system flaws. Here the user who owns the land registers his land details and also enters market value of the land by providing all the necessary proofs. A government authority who traditionally looks into land registry is assigned as a super admin can do the registration process. Lands coming under a particular village can be registered to the system only through the super admin who is assigned to that village. The smart contract used here is written in such a way that the owner has to transfer his property completely to the buyer and no transaction of the land can be partial.

Strong identity management systems are now more important than ever due to the growth of online services and the growing digitalization of personal and corporate data. Identity theft, data breaches, and security lapses are commonplace with traditional centralized identity management techniques that depend on a single authoritative body for identity verification and authentication. Growing interest has been shown in using blockchain technology for identity management as a solution to these problems. Originally created as the foundational technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain provides a decentralized, impenetrable structure for organizing and preserving digital documents. Blockchain guarantees transparency, immutability, and integrity by spreading data over a network of nodes and securing transactions with cryptographic techniques. This makes it a perfect fit for identity management systems. The idea of using blockchain technology for safe, decentralized identity management is examined in this study. We seek to investigate the possible advantages, difficulties, and real-world uses of blockchain-based identity management systems by an extensive analysis of the current literature, case studies, and real-world implementations. This study aims to give useful information for enterprises, governments, and researchers interested in deploying safe and decentralized identity management systems in a quickly expanding digital environment by synthesizing ideas from diverse sources.', 'Most of the existing identity systems are built on top of centralized storage systems. Storing identity data on these types of centralized storage platforms(e.g cloud storage, central servers) becomes a major privacy concern since various types of attacks and data breaches can happen. With this research, we are proposing blockchain and self-sovereign identity based digital identity (KYC - Know Your Customer) platform “Casper” to address the issues on centralized identity systems. “Casper ” is an Android/iOS based mobile identity wallet application that combines the integration of blockchain and a self-sovereign identity-based approach. Unlike centralized identity systems, the actual identities of the customer/users are stored in the customers’ mobile wallet application. The proof of these identities is stored in the blockchain-based decentralized storage as a self-sovereign identity proof. Casper platforms’ Self-Sovereign Identity(SSI)-based system provides a Zero Knowledge Proof(ZKP) mechanism to verify the identity information. Casper platform can be adopted in various domains such as healthcare, banking, government organization etc. As a use case, we have discussed building a digital identity wallet for banking customers with the Casper platform.

Existing problems require modern solutions. The problems that have existed through decades or even centuries can now be solved through current technologies. Blockchain is one of the technologies that is going to have an extensive and comprehensive change in people's lives. Blockchain is an emerging technology and its fields of application are being explored. The domain of field chosen in this paper for its application is the public sector. Pioneering research done in the field of public services working shows that bureaucracy, corruption can be reduced as well as on the other hand, efficiency and level of trust in public record keeping can be increased using blockchain technology. Blockchain can be used in government fund management. Whole government budgeting, funding, auditing and financial records can be brought on the blockchain network. Today, in general, the allocated funds are not traceable, there is no concrete knowledge as to how, where and what percentage of funds are being utilized and a large part of these expenditures are never shown in records due to corruption. To culminate this problem, a Blockchain system has been proposed to provide transparency and proficiency.""]",1.06

However, current regulatory systems often suffers from information imbalances, low authenticity, and credibility. To address these challenges, this study proposes a blockchain-based SLI framework that leverages the decentralized, tamper-proof, traceable, and transparent nature of blockchain technology to provide a reliable platform for SLI. Furthermore, we designed an information data structure on the blockchain and presented the information flow process. We developed smart contracts that utilize automation capability to automatically aggregate, analyze, and publish warnings based on on-chain data, enabling the evaluation of relevant departments’ performance.

This algorithm is based on the PBFT consensus protocol and incorporates dynamic scalability mechanisms, scoring models, and simplified consistency protocols to enhance the consensus efficiency of SLI applications. Finally, the experiments were conducted. We developed an SLI prototype system and compared and analyzed the performance of SLI-PBFT with other PBFT-based consensus algorithms within the SLI prototype system. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the SLI framework. Moreover, SLI-PBFT exhibits significant improvements in throughput and reduced latency compared to other algorithms in the context of SLI applications.

Nevertheless, with the complexity of the network environment and growing amount of network users, the advance of blockchain is gradually restricted by the efficiency, security and reliability of consensus protocols. In this paper, we propose a delegated randomization Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol named DRBFT based on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the consensus procedure. Specifically, a random selection algorithm called RS is developed to cooperate with the voting mechanism, which can effectively reduce the number of nodes participating in the consensus process.

Therefore, relying on the blockchain attribute encryption algorithm, a new smart city communication data security sharing method is designed. Relying on the principle of attribute base encryption, the data encryption algorithm is designed to realize the encryption and decryption of smart city communication data. In chronological order, all encrypted data are stored on the block sharing chain, and the corresponding keys and ciphertext are quickly generated by the request of multiple nodes participating in joint computing. Finally, through the OBDD (orderly binary decision chart) access structure, the data on the sharing chain is efficiently accessed to realize the secure sharing of communication data. The experimental results show that when the proposed method is applied to share the data in smart city communication, the average time of data encryption and decryption is 1. 9s,0.2s, which greatly reduces the cost of data security sharing.', 'Smart city infrastructures are resulting in a concern regarding proper security and fine- grained access control for the access of the sensitive data generated by the interconnected devices and services. Having rich yet heterogeneous environments is a common scenario for organizations nowadays, and conventional access control mechanisms often do not suffice to provide support for flexible, scalable and decentralized authorization. Here, we develop a new access control method that leverages Cipher text-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) and Ethereum smart contracts to realize decentralized and fine-grained data access in smart city applications. Users are allowed to access and decrypt information only if they own a suitable set of attribute. They leverage smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to perform attribute verification, issue keys, and log access actions, which removes the need to trust a centralized authority. We also describe the architecture of the system, the design of smart contracts, and an implementation prototype. The experimental results can validate the computational efficiency, the gas consumption and the policy expressiveness of our approach, showing that it is a promising solution for secure and transparent data access control model in smart cities.', 'Data is a key asset in our interconnected and smart city. Especially, in the context of healthcare, healthcare data can facilitate remote diagnosis and medical research. Because of the potentially sensitive nature of healthcare data, privacy is a key consideration for both individuals and organizations.

To support one or more notions of privacy, the potential of solutions, such as fine-grained access control [e.g., those based on attribute-based encryption (ABE)] and blockchain in realizing data sharing has been explored. However, these approaches generally only facilitate access control of data and the traceability of the sharing process, and do not protect the attribute and privilege policy privacy of users. Therefore, in this article, we implement HAPPS, a hidden attribute and privilege-protection data-sharing scheme with verifiability. The three key building blocks of HAPPS are zero-knowledge proof, blockchain, and distributed ABE (DABE). Specifically, in our approach, we propose a new data access control strategy (i.e., attribute-hidden zero-knowledge proof—at-ZKP) to hide user identity and attributes during the authorization process. Our scheme is embedded in the blockchain and built into the decentralized sharing platform to prevent central verifier counterfeiting and support auditing. To demonstrate utility, we prove that HAPPS ensures data, attribute, and privilege policy privacy. Findings of our evaluations implemented on Ethereum and using the data set from the healthcare cost and utilization project (HCUP), we demonstrate that our scheme can share sensitive healthcare records belonging to minors (e.g., children) without the at-ZKP incurring unrealistic cost.']",0.83

This paper introduces the Digital Government Services Acceptance Model (DGSAM), developed by building on UTAUT and incorporating additional constructs relevant to the public sector.

DGSAM provides both researchers and policymakers with a tailored tool for improving digital government services and boosting public adoption rates.', 'Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce the special issue about generation of public value through smart technologies and strategies. The key argument is that smart technologies have the potential to foster co-creation of public services and the generation of public value in management processes, based on the collaborative, social and horizontal nature of these smart technologies. Understanding these processes from a public management perspective is the purpose of this paper and the rest of the special issue. Design/methodology/approach The approach to this paper is a theoretical and conceptual review, whereas practical implications both for scholars and practitioners arise from the review of the literature and the conceptual approximation to the notion of smartness in technologies and government. This approach is rooted in the potential of the latest smart technologies and strategies to transform public administrations and to better understand and cope societal problems. Findings The conceptual and theoretical perspective of this paper offers ideas for future developments. The content of this paper shows that new smart technologies and strategies will shape, and will be shaped by, the future of public organizations and management. This paper illustrates the process of change in public value generation over time, as a result of different public management paradigms (from traditional public administration to new public management), but also different types of technologies (from mainframes to websites and social media and beyond). The empirical evidence of the articles of this special issue supports this conclusion; that open and collaborative innovation processes developed under this emergent technological wave could become encouraging transformative practices in the public sector. Research limitations/implications The theoretical and conceptual nature of this paper needs further empirical research to validate some of the discussed assumptions and ideas. Originality/value Although this paper is oriented to present the main contents of the special issue, it also provides an original approach to the theme of public value generation using smart technologies and strategies in public sector management.', ""Public value creation is traditionally considered as the citizens' collective expectations with respect to government and public services. Recent e-government literature indicates that what exactly constitutes public value in digital government is still debated. Whereas previous research acknowledges aspects such as co-production and the orchestration role of government in the context of public value creation, there is only a limited understanding of how public value is created by the interactions between government and business actors, and the role digital technologies play in that process. Furthermore, so far, research into public value creation processes is limited to specific services that aim to meet a specific goal; for a more complete view, an integrative perspective is required to address the multiplicity of goals. Societal challenges including climate change, sustainability, and the transition towards circularity will require governments to play a crucial role. Businesses are also transforming their vision by adding societal goals to their economic objectives and contributing to these societal challenges. This necessitates even more the need to explicitly consider the role of business in public value creation processes. In this paper we argue that there is a need to understand public value creation as an interactive process, involving both government and business actors. In this process, voluntary information sharing enabled by digital infrastructures has the potential to contribute to the value creation processes, but the increased complexity of digital technologies obscures the effects they can have on value creation. Therefore, we develop a framework that allows to reason about public value creation as an interactive process, involving government and businesses, facilitated by voluntary information sharing. The framework also allows to reason about how the technological design choices of the underlying digital infrastructure influence this value creation process. For the framework development, we use an in-depth case study from the domain of international trade. We analyze the interactions between customs authorities and supply chain actors for jointly creating public value related to revenue collection, as well as safety and security of goods entering the European Union, using business data made available via a global blockchain-enabled infrastructure. In future research, the framework that we developed can be used to analyze more complex cases with additional public value aspects, such as sustainability and circularity.""]",0.78

By connecting these components, the model facilitates government regulation, emission reduction by electricity companies, electricity purchasing by consumers, and trading of surplus carbon allowances in the carbon market. The key innovations of our model include the establishment of a standardized carbon accounting system, enhanced data transparency to reduce the risk of data falsification, and a two-stage differential game framework that optimizes social welfare through effective control of total carbon emissions. Our simulations demonstrate that this blockchain system can effectively stabilize carbon emissions at a desirable level, thereby contributing to more efficient pollution control.', 'Climate change is the greatest long term threat that the global Community is currently facing. In response, many countries are submitting enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UN, committing to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030.

To support these efforts, the proposed solution aims to develop a fully-functional, automatic and blockchain-powered Carbon trading platform that enables market participants to track, manage and trade GHG Credits (often referred to as Carbon Credits) while also helping the government to verily actual emission reductions. Blockchain-based architecture ensures that emissions data is tamper-proof, auditable securely recorded, enhancing accountability and participant trust. The carbon trading platform runs on CAP-and-Trade mechanism which is Government regulated Compliance market, in which specific sectors and Companies (usually called as obligated entities) are designated allowed to generate a certain volume of emissions (i.e. a CAP, carbon emission limit, acts as a Carbon emission Allowance Permit for these carbon emitters).

Blockchain technology can help companies use smart contracts to support early warning of carbon emission rights, storage technology can provide credible authorization for governments and companies, and so on. By using blockchain technology to support the business case for carbon trading, power companies can track carbon trading data on the chain, using generation and consumption data, user information and data from users who trade both electricity and carbon to provide reliable evidence for various market participants.

This may lead to a potential threat for people, governments, and business sectors. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel access control scheme for unauthorized UAV detection and mitigation in an Internet of Drones (IoD) environment, called ACSUD-IoD. With the help of the blockchain-based solution incorporated in ACSUD-IoD, the transactional data having both the normal secure data from a drone (UAV) to the Ground Station Server (GSS) and the abnormal (suspected) data for detection of unauthorized UAVs by the GSS are stored in private blockchain, that are authentic and genuine.

The testbed experiments for various cryptographic primitives using the broadly-accepted Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library (MIRACL) have been performed under both server and Raspberry PI 3 configurations.

Traditional UAVs are vulnerable because they depend on widely recognized communication methods. Furthermore, UAVs do not offer complete data protection for a number of security-critical jobs, which could lead to serious loss and potentially fatal outcomes. The suggested blockchain-based scheme's primary goal is to assure the system's security in terms of confidentiality, Integrity, and availability so that UAVs can efficiently communicate data with other UAVs.
