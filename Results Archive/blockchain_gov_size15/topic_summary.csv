This paper probes the challenges that smart cities face regarding disaster management and proposes a distributed framework leveraging a six-layer architecture involving Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), blockchain technology, and edge computing to boost resilience and response capabilities. IPFS provides decentralized storage with interfacing, thus guaranteeing data integrity and availability during natural disasters. Blockchain technology helps in improving data transparency, ensuring tamper-proof updates, and elevating logistics through-put. Smart contracts facilitate efficient coordination and resource allocation. Edge computing enables real-time data processing, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing the routing of physical resources to key locations for increased system efficiency. Connecting, investigating, aligning, and sharing information in a decentralized manner fosters teamwork among stakeholders. Community engagement and reporting tools are provided for smart city dwellers to participate in disaster management activities. The proposed system ensures a more resilient and faster disaster response.', 'This project presents a novel blockchain-based disaster management system designed to streamline and optimize the response process to natural disasters. The system’s front-end is built using React, while its back-end runs on Flask. It enables different stakeholders, including aid organizations, government agencies, and relief workers, to access different parts of the system, enhancing collaboration, and increasing efficiency. The system comprises four main categories: missing people log, aid package distribution, critical areas, and refugee-relief camp mapping, each having multiple modules. The blockchain-based system allows for secure and immutable record-keeping of all critical data, enhancing transparency, accountability, and trust. Smart contracts are utilized to automate various aspects disaster management, enabling the rapid and efficient delivery of aid packages to affected areas. The decentralized nature blockchain allows for the efficient coordination of resources and effective management of aid distribution, reducing waste and ensuring that resources are delivered to those in need. The system’s unique features, such as tamper-proof data storage, automated processes, and decentralized coordination, provide an innovative solution to the challenges faced in disaster management and relief efforts.', 'Blockchain technology presents benefits that change the way business partners interact. This new way of establishing democratic trust encourages business owners to think differently. Disaster relief and aid industries are built on the power of collaborating participants. A very high number of participants in different hierarchies, including donors, charities, disaster victims, insurance companies and government agencies interact under extraordinary circumstances of a disaster and hard times. Establishing a new way of trust brings forward a better disaster recovery. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based ecosystem. The blockchain-based disaster recovery not only would enhance the basic processes around disaster relief, but also promote the willingness of help by transparency and potential fraud prevention. This new blockchain system introduces an opportunity to be more resilient, to react rapidly, to communicate transparently, and to include new contributors such as IoT.']",0.44

However, most of these IoT devices are easy to hack and compromise. Typically, these IoT devices are limited in compute, storage, and network capacity, and therefore they are more vulnerable to attacks than other endpoint devices such as smartphones, tablets, or computers. In this paper, we present and survey major security issues for IoT. We review and categorize popular security issues with regard to the IoT layered architecture, in addition to protocols used for networking, communication, and management. We outline security requirements for IoT along with the existing attacks, threats, and state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, we tabulate and map IoT security problems against existing solutions found in the literature. More importantly, we discuss, how blockchain, which is the underlying technology for bitcoin, can be a key enabler to solve many IoT security problems. The paper also identifies open research problems and challenges for IoT security.', 'In this study researchers have analyzed and appraised the IoT concerns and obstacles in the deployment of smart cities in the Indian context. It is widely known that IoT improvements and applications are still in the early phases of development. Furthermore, there are several difficulties and obstacles linked with IoT, including legal, regulatory, and economic concerns. With this infrastructure development, as well as problems of security and privacy. Apart from that, the research goes over the same ground again and describes the network communication types that were utilized to connect electronic devises and internet through different layers with which electronic gadgets and the Internet are linked. The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications were also covered. The concept of blockchain in the formation of smart cities and information systems has been proposed. Current research is a qualitative study which adds to the body of knowledge in the field of IoT and smart city development. As per review of literature smart cities and IoT innovation solutions will have a favorable impact on country growth, despite the fact that their adoption rate is somewhat low due to a lack of confidence, insufficient innovation, and restricted access to technology infrastructure. All governing authorities should devise compelling measures to ensure that this new invention succeeds. To administer advanced technologies, first promote the growth of progressive networks by providing the communication sector with the necessary incentive and independence. The paper also include a futuristic approach to IoT for constructing smart cities, as well as problems in technology deployment.', 'Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in many smart applications such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, industry, etc. In addition, the importance of IoT-based architectures has increased with the emergence of innovative technologies such as 5G networks and quantum computing. Electrochemical sensors (ECS) have recently been used in IoT-based architectures thanks to their easy integration into smart systems in many fields such as pharmaceutical, food, medical diagnosis, clinical, genetic analysis, wearable, forensic identification, and monitoring of environmental variables. However, Although IoT-based systems have ensured the availability of sensor data in traditional architecture, there are many challenges, such as low latency, availability, real-time data traceability, and security. In addition, new challenges regarding security and privacy have emerged in the system as the ever-growing smart connected IoT devices generate a significant amount of heterogeneous data. Given these challenges, in this paper, we propose PPFchain, a new federated learning-enabled blockchain-based framework to ensure the security and privacy of sensor-IoT-based architectures using sampled ECS data. PPFchain has a lightweight, low-cost, high-performance architecture in the IoT-based blockchain network. In the architecture, we used the federated model and cryptographic primitives for user and data privacy in off-chain fog nodes considering performance. Moreover, we compared with traditional blockchain models using various performance metrics for system performance in a distributed architecture, such as an event and storage-based smart contract. In addition, the results show that the PPFchain provides accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced security.']",86.28

In healthcare, balancing patient care with the privacy of information, ease of accessibility and comprehensiveness has been a challenge. Healthcare directly affects humanity and so is one of the first areas where blockchain is implemented because the healthcare system has various problems that should be addressed. Blockchain can solve not only the data management issues between different stakeholders but also saves millions of dollars, reduce forging, and empower the patients. It has contributed to the transparency of insurance claims, management of Electronic Health Record (EHR), and also helps in genome research and so much more. This paper presents a systematic review of the recent research done in the application and major challenges for blockchain technology in the healthcare system. We have reviewed almost 56 papers selected from various search engines. This review focuses on some key areas that are discussed in many pieces of research such as interoperability, security management, fraud prevention, and financial issues. Major challenges and opportunities in the implementation of this technology are also discussed in this review. The basic issue in the healthcare industry is extraordinary costs of the medical facility and subsequent insurance claims. Where the involvement of various parties (hospitals, doctors, insurance companies, and government) makes it very difficult to ensure transparency which casts doubts among stakeholders. It is also observed that despite the favorite area for researchers the technology is not yet implemented on vast levels. Still, a lot of work is required to identify and then resolve the major challenges and issues in the way to transform the health system. The investors need to be convinced about the benefits of blockchain in the healthcare system so that the technology can be implemented on large scale.', 'Despite significant improvements in healthcare innovations and administration, little has been done to address security threats such as data breaches or cybersecurity. To ensure the best services, healthcare authorities must manage healthcare data effectively—not just during or post-pandemic situations such as COVID-19, but also in their regular operations. Blockchain (BC) technology can be utilized to increase the security of healthcare data management. Healthcare providers may create a transparent, tamper-proof system for handling patient records, authentication, and access control by utilizing blockchain. We offer a general blockchain-enabled healthcare architecture for managing healthcare data reflecting various participant interactions. Our system connects all parties, including physicians, patients, governments, supply chains, and other healthcare practitioners, via the Ethereum network. The smart contract code development and testing were done on the Remix IDE platform. We have combined Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to provide decentralized storage. In addition to examining numerous safety concerns, we also compared our solution to other blockchain-based systems and offered a cost analysis of the various transactions it proposes. We have also demonstrated the benefits of using Blockchain for a secure and reliable healthcare system. We also highlight the existing challenges in adopting BC in healthcare data management, as well as potential future research directions, both in terms of deployment and real-world application.', 'Healthcare blockchains provide an innovative way to store healthcare information, execute healthcare transactions, and build trust for healthcare data sharing and data integration in a decentralized open healthcare network environment. Although the healthcare blockchain technology has attracted broad interests and attention in industry, government and academia, the security and privacy concerns remain the focus of debate when deploying blockchains for information sharing in the healthcare sector from business operation to research collaboration. This article focuses on the security and privacy requirements for medical data sharing using blockchain, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the security and privacy risks and requirements, accompanied by technical solution techniques and strategies. First, we discuss the security and privacy requirements and attributes required for electronic medical data sharing by deploying the healthcare blockchain. Second, we categorize existing efforts into three reference blockchain usage scenarios for electronic medical data sharing, and discuss the technologies for implementing these security and privacy properties in the three categories of usage scenarios for healthcare blockchain, such as anonymous signatures, attribute-based encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, verification techniques for smart contract security. Finally, we discuss other potential blockchain application scenarios in healthcare sector. We conjecture that this survey will help healthcare professionals, decision makers, and healthcare service developers to gain technical and intuitive insights into the security and privacy of healthcare blockchains in terms of concepts, risks, requirements, development and deployment technologies and systems.']",7.56

Ethereum's smart contract capabilities make it possible to develop tamper-proof and transparent e-voting systems. Smart contracts are self-executing programs that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, and can be used to automate the process of voting and ensure that the results are accurate and verifiable. This paper explores the use of Ethereum for e-voting, including the advantages and challenges of using this platform for voting. The paper discusses the use of smart contracts for implementing e-voting systems, the security and privacy considerations that must be taken into account, and the potential benefits of using Ethereum for e-voting. The paper also discusses the challenges that must be overcome to ensure the widespread adoption of Ethereum-based e-voting systems, including issues related to scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance. In conclusion, this paper argues that Ethereum has the potential to revolutionize the field of e-voting, offering a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for conducting political elections. While there are still many challenges to overcome, the use of Ethereum for e-voting represents an exciting opportunity for governments, businesses, and individuals around the world to participate in democratic processes in a more secure and efficient way."", 'A widespread mistrust towards the traditional voting system has made democratic voting in any country very critical. People have seen their fundamental rights being violated. Other digital voting systems have been challenged due to a lack of transparency. Most voting systems are not transparent enough; this makes it very difficult for the government to gain voters’ trust. The reason behind the failure of the traditional and current digital voting system is that it can be easily exploited. The primary objective is to resolve problems of the traditional and digital voting system, which include any kind of mishap or injustice during the process of voting. Blockchain technology can be used in the voting system to have a fair election and reduce injustice. The physical voting systems have many flaws in it as well as the digital voting systems are not perfect enough to be implemented on large scale. This appraises the need for a solution to secure the democratic rights of the people. This article presents a platform based on modern technology blockchain that provides maximum transparency and reliability of the system to build a trustful relationship between voters and election authorities. The proposed platform provides a framework that can be implemented to conduct voting activity digitally through blockchain without involving any physical polling stations. Our proposed framework supports a scalable blockchain, by using flexible consensus algorithms. The Chain Security Algorithm applied in the voting system makes the voting transaction more secure. Smart contracts provide a secure connection between the user and the network while executing a transaction in the chain. The security of the blockchain based voting system has also been discussed. Additionally, encryption of transactions using cryptographic hash and prevention of attack 51% on the blockchain has also been elaborated. Furthermore, the methodology for carrying out blockchain transactions during the process of voting has been elaborated using Blockchain Finally, the performance evaluation of the proposed system shows that the system can be implemented in a large-scale population.', 'Due to the impact of the pandemic and globalization, many governments worldwide have begun to replace paper voting with electronic voting systems. This is primarily intended to increase voting efficiency and reduce personnel costs. However, electronic voting is usually centralized, which creates difficulties in ensuring the integrity of the voting process and protecting voter privacy. As a solution, we propose an efficient and anonymous web3-based voting system that provides incentives. The use of blockchain technology ensures that voting results are stored in a decentralized manner, reducing the possibility of tampering and ensuring vote integrity. To protect voter privacy, our system incorporates stealth addresses to conceal ballot content and lightweight ring signatures to verify voter validity without the risk of double voting. Furthermore, our voting system utilizes smart contracts to encourage voting and self-tallying, resulting in improved transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms several existing e-voting systems, thus providing a robust and secure alternative for governments seeking to improve their voting systems.']",3.33
3,43,3_registration_property_records_real,"['registration', 'property', 'records', 'real', 'transaction', 'ownership', 'ledger', 'network', 'block', 'documents']","['Due to the duplicity and inefficiencies in the current land registration system, the land records are not secured, and citizens face the brunt of this. Similar to this, thousands of people are dealing with this situation. Fraudsters use numerous faults in the current property registration process to swindle both the public and the government. The implementation of a secure land registration using Blockchain and majority consensus is examined in this study. The adoption of Blockchain by the land register significantly lowers security issues. Since each block is linked to the hash of the one before it, each block’s hash value will be unique. It uses a hashing algorithm known as SHA256. The security of the data linked with each transaction is improved by the Proof of Work (PoW) method with SHA256. Each hash in the message digest is fixed for all the blocks and represents the complete collection of transactions contained in these blocks. The responsibility for mining new blocks, chaining with existing Blockchain and validating transactions falls on a node. Hashes are used to link transactions together via merge trees, which requires less storage. Thus, a 99% decrease in the human record-keeping effort is offered by the suggested usage of Blockchain for land registration.', 'In the traditional land and house registration system in India, brokers play a central role in facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers. These intermediaries handle the creation and assembly of physical documents required to establish ownership and agreements. Once the necessary paperwork is completed, the broker ensures the registration of the property at an authorized government office, where the transaction details are manually recorded in a ledger. However, this process is fraught with challenges, including the risk of document loss, tampering, or unauthorized alterations, as physical records can be easily accessed or manipulated by individuals with influence or power. Such vulnerabilities compromise the integrity of property ownership and create opportunities for corruption and fraud. In contrast, the proposed system leverages smart contracts and the Hyperledger framework to create a more secure, transparent, and decentralized alternative. Smart contracts automate the transaction process, ensuring that all terms are enforced without the need for intermediaries, while the Hyperledger framework ensures immutability and synchronization of records across a decentralized network. This innovative approach eliminates manual inefficiencies, enhances security, and reduces opportunities for fraud by providing a tamper-proof system. Furthermore, the transparency and portability offered by the proposed solution install greater trust among participants, making it a robust alternative to traditional methods. By combining these advanced technologies, the system addresses critical weaknesses in the traditional approach and sets a new standard for property registration processes. The proposed system uses smart contracts and the Hyperledger framework to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized property registration solution. Smart contracts automate transactions, removing the need for intermediaries, while Hyperledger ensures tamper-proof records and synchronized data across a decentralized network. This eliminates inefficiencies, enhances security, reduces fraud, and builds trust among participants, offering a modern, reliable alternative to traditional registration methods.', 'The procedure of registering a property involves paying stamp duty, and registering the sales deed for the property you have purchased. Property registration is done at the office of the sub-registrar who has jurisdiction over the area in which you purchased it. Land/property registration is a long process necessitating numerous paper checks, in-person meetings, and cash exchanges, which results in significant delays and is both time- and money-consuming. In India, currently government is practicing the paper-based land registration system which raises significant problems like high time intricacy, centralized authority, physical visit to property site for authentication, high cost of transactions, proneness to human error, frauds involving property documents, lack of communication, third-party participation, ineffectiveness, timing issues and issue with ownership. These issues are getting worse every day; hence the registry procedure system needs to be improved. In this study, to overcome such challenges we will develop a tamper-proof, fraud-resistant, automated Blockchain - based system to create, issue, securely store, share and verify the Land Registration Records. The proposed system will also provide a digital locker all the stakeholders for keeping land record certificates. All the actions taken by different entities involved in the land record registration will be time-stamped, verified by the different nodes, and stored as a block which has a unique hash value, so that neither the hackers/spammers nor the insiders can issue a counterfeit certificate on a later date or modify/tamper the original certificate.']",2.39
