However, due to the large scale of terminal access, complex business operation relationship, network system vulnerability and more and more loopholes, the traditional network security technology is difficult to ensure the security of the system. This paper proposes to solve the security problems caused by large-scale terminal access by using the certificate-free security mechanism based on domestic cryptography, so as to provide security guarantee for the construction of electricity internet of things. At the same time, in order to meet the security requirements of energy Internet information interaction, this paper proposes a decentralized key management idea to solve the traditional IBC (identity based Cryptograph) algorithm key update problem, improve the security management and control ability of the system, and comprehensively support the construction of world-class energy Internet enterprises with excellent competitiveness.', 'Blockchain is one of the next digital technologies that Industry 4.0 incorporates advances with. For both small and big businesses, blockchain may be used to enhance security, privacy, and data openness. The term “Industry 4.0” refers to the integration of several cutting-edge production methods that accelerate the pace at which enterprises may achieve their objectives.

However, data security and privacy have become a bottleneck of big data development. To address this issue, the blockchain with distributed ledger as an important key technology provides an effective solution for data security in big data. In this paper, a system model based on blockchain for data sharing and security is proposed. Based on the model, a data sharing scheme has proposed. In the scheme, block consensus and data sharing as two important stages are highlighted. In the simulation, the result shows that the performance of proposed scheme is much higher than that of attribute-based encryption scheme when the size of the encrypting data is large.', 'To avoid the security vulnerabilities and privacy leakage risks in the process of government data sharing, a data sharing scheme for government data based on blockchain is proposed in this paper. As one of the basic protocols for the next generation of global credit authentication and value Internet, blockchain technology has been paid more and more attention. The blockchain is used to realize data tamper-proof, distributed storage, privacy protection, traceability, and access control. Data sharing and exchange agreements between government public services have adopted blockchain technology, providing identity authentication and message permission management. Using the blockchain to record the sharing behavior and provide traceability, the smart contract is used to share and manage the data and ensure the data’s consistency on-chain and off-chain. Due to shortcomings of government data sharing, the paper designs a data-sharing scheme and technical framework based on blockchain technology. From its perspective, it takes housing provident fund data sharing, for example, to establish a provident fund chain in the industry. This blockchain application scenario has been applied to the housing provident fund industry, forming a new model of industry data sharing.', ""As time goes on and technology gets better, various data-sharing technologies are becoming more and more integrated into many different businesses. Therefore, data exchange and security are crucial for the data's value to be realized. Nevertheless, it is challenging to verify the authenticity of a basic data sharing method in order to detect electronic data usage traces. An further difficulty is the reluctance of data suppliers to provide their data. Employing Blockchain's distributed ledger, smart contract, data trust, and traceability features. For the purpose of facilitating secure access to data, this study introduces a blockchain-based data-sharing architecture that optimizes to circumvent the security and control issues associated with traditional centralized data sharing and administration. In addition, the research evaluates the practicality and safety of the prototype. Furthermore, this paper proposes a Secured Data Management Scheme (SDMS) that utilizes blockchain technology to optimize data sharing efficiency. To assess the efficacy of this model, it is cross-validated with the conventional Data Privacy Handler (DPH) method. While present centralized security solutions fail to meet security requirements in an IoT setting, blockchain technology provides a decentralized solution. Through the use of a blockchain and a WiFi-enabled network model, this article seeks to offer a secure communication framework for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. According to the results, attitudes and character quirks have a role in how the intelligence community plans to use a blockchain-based data-sharing model for integrating systems.

Adopting Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies facilitates sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) with the precise decision-making of supply chain activities and the realisation of circular development. However, according to the bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review of articles related to “SSCM”, few frameworks with I4.0 technologies are found to empower SSCM under circular economy (CE) logic. Thus, this article proposes a conceptual framework of I4.0 technologies-embedded SSCM, which takes advantage of five kinds of emerging digital technologies, including cloud services, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), blockchain technology (BT), and internet of things (IoT). The CAB2IN framework is based on the technologies mentioned above alongside the design, manufacturing, delivering, using, and end-of-life stages of products and services to meet the requirements of reducing material usage, remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. This paper's contribution lies in indicating the trends of SSCM in the era of Industry 4.0 and proposing CAB2IN to creatively establish the virtual side of circular SSCM, which leverages the data generated in each stage to assist sustainable decision-making. CAB2IN illuminates several research directions for future studies of digitalised SSCM under the perspective of CE. The case of Company S illustrates the application of CAB2IN in the healthcare supply chain. This paper also summarises insightful directions of digitalised SSCM under the proposed circular framework."", 'The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), characterized by the integration of advanced digital technologies and intelligent systems, presents a transformative opportunity for achieving sustainable manufacturing. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how Industry 4.0 technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Industrial Internet of Things, blockchain, digital twins, big data analytics, advanced robotics, and additive manufacturing, can be leveraged to foster environmentally responsible, socially equitable, and economically viable industrial practices. The study examines the impact of these technologies across diverse industrial sectors and evaluates their effects on the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic, and social. Specifically, the study identifies the manufacturing processes that most benefit from Industry 4.0, including resource efficiency, waste minimization, and supply chain optimization. It identifies key areas of manufacturing that stand to benefit, such as resource efficiency, waste reduction, and supply chain optimization.

These advancements drive positive social outcomes, including improved workforce safety, the creation of new skill-based jobs, and more equitable access to digital infrastructure. However, the study also highlights that while these technologies can improve resource efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, their widespread implementation may also intensify social challenges, such as job displacement and inequality, and exacerbate environmental trade-offs, particularly in energy consumption. To navigate these complexities, the study proposes an integrative framework that encompasses technological, cultural, and policy dimensions, providing a valuable roadmap for aligning Industry 4.0 advancements with robust governance mechanisms and fostering a culture of sustainability within organizations and society at large.', 'The synergy between Industry 4.0, production, and supply chain management is transforming industrial ecosystems, enabling more intelligent, automated, and interconnected systems.

Electronic health records are one of the critical drivers of this transition. Moreover, the number of records on personal health grows exponentially with the rise of mobile and omnipresent computing. This trend is characterized by wearable computing technology and various kinds of sensors related to health domain. Results in need of an automated data storage method that healthcare professionals and patients can use. There is currently no trusted medical data sharing and storage system in the chain of health value. Therefore, no platform is used to track the traceability of patients across the entire healthcare chain. Our goal is to create an integrated view based on interoperability principles that will collect such data from patients' medical records, based on the use of sensors from different wearable devices and other sources. The data collected is consolidated into a single electronic health records system, where the patient is the owner of data by interconnecting multiple healthcare providers. This strategy offers improved privacy advantages while ensuring safe access to medical records for patients. The original paper contributes to the description of uniting the entire medical value chain, the design of the system architectural model, the creation of system components, and the validation through a proof of concept (PoC). The PoC can show the feasibility of data exchange between health care professionals and incorporating the health records of heterogeneous sources like health care systems and sensors."", 'In the past decade, the digitalization of the health-care industry and electronic healthcare records (EHR) rises rapidly. The concept of smart health gradually gains momentum as information technology advances. Smart healthcare transforms and improves traditional medical systems in efficiency, service and personalization by integrating technologies like the internet of things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). On the other hand, smart healthcare systems are highly prone to security breaches and various malicious attacks. Blockchain technology has recently emerged as a promising solution for improving data management, access control, and integrity inside healthcare systems. This paper presents a survey of research on the latest blockchain solutions combined with AI technologies for improving and innovating new technical standards for the healthcare ecosystem related to medical diagnostics and electronic health records sharing, with a special focus on medical imaging.', ""The Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded because of the development of information technology. IoT impacts several fields, including the medical profession, smart cities, and data management. The development of sustainable medical systems is significantly aided by the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). IoMT has a big impact on healthcare since it makes it easier to monitor and validate data about patients before storing it in the cloud. Keeping all data confidential and secured is essential since the IoMT is a big-data platform that is expanding quickly.This paper will apply this technical advancement to the realm of health, namely e-health. The research provides an IoMT-based monitoring tool for personal health surveillance. Block chain technology may resolve present interoperability issues in health-related systems and offer technological solutions that allow the electronic transfer of medical records to medical organizations and medical specialists. However, the transmission and security of people's health data remain a major concern in IoMT devices across a wide range of product categories. This research uses block chain as a secure solution to satisfy the requirements of medical privacy and data security. In this study, a Block chain-based IoMT security System (BC-IoMT-SS) is presented based on BC technology in IoMT for the security, privacy, and management of patient information. The suggested framework is successfully implemented to fulfill the optimal privacy and safety criteria for medical data management in IoMT gadgets. Utilizing the block chain's key, a healthcare application system has been created in which the person's health data may safely generate alerts for verified healthcare practitioners. Simulation results demonstrate that the suggested BC-IoMT-SS technique produces a high precision ratio of 94%, an efficiency ratio of 94%, a shorter delay of 0.63s, and a shorter reaction time compared to other current methods.""]"

The transparency and provenance of a machine learning model are important aspects of federated learning systems since they impact peoples’ lives in various domains (e.g., from healthcare to personal finance to employment). However, most of the existing federated learning systems deal with centralized coordinators which are vulnerable to attacks and privacy breaches. Also, they do not provide any standard transparency and provenance mechanisms for the resulting models. In this paper, we propose a blockchain and Model Card-based integrated federated learning system &quot;Bassa-ML&quot; providing enhanced transparency and trust for the models. Model parameter sharing, local model generation, model averaging, and model sharing functions are implemented using smart contracts. The generated models, model training information, and model reports are stored in the blockchain ledger as Model Card Objects. This results in enhanced transparency and auditability to the federated learning process.', 'In the era of big data, how to balance model training with privacy of users’ data presents as a difficult problem. We present Federated Learning at Scale: A Systematization of Existing Work and a Blueprint for Future Research, which enables large-scale collaborative deep learning across many clients without centralizing data. Unlike standard machine learning methods, which aggregate raw data in one location, our federated approach ensures that client data resides on the corresponding devices. Through FedAvg, rather than sharing sensitive data, model updates are shared and aggregated by a central server. The proposed architecture involves necessary privacy aware techniques like isolated local training, secure communication protocol, and compatibility with Differential Privacy (DP) and Secure Aggregation (SA) algorithms. We evaluate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach on the MNIST dataset, with 5 simulated clients. Results from ten rounds of communication demonstrate the effectiveness of the DEGRA model and show that accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score improve significantly (from 66.43% to 96.42%), and the model can achieve a performance comparable to that of centralized training in a decentralized and privacy-conscious manner. This model is designed for edge scalability, resilient to data heterogeneity and low communication overhead, making it especially suitable for deployment in real applications, for example, mobile health, banking and IoT systems. The architecture itself is lightweight and flexible for easy scaling-up to more data and more complex non-IID data distributions. The proposed federated learning model can effectively tradeoff between performance and privacy and can support the construction of secure, scalable, and trustworthy AI systems. The code is available on the GitHub repository https://github.com/IndrasenaManga/FederatedLearning-at-Scale-A-Privacy-Preserving-Framework-for-Decentralized-AI-Training', ""To solve the data silos and data security dilemma faced by machine learning (ML), the concept of federated learning (FL) was first proposed, and federated learning has also attracted great attention from the information security community in recent years, where the most concerned issue is the security of data and models in federated learning. The current centralized federated learning scheme is prone to single point of failure as well as central server evil problem, so blockchain is used to replace the central server, but the blockchain network is not immune to poisoning attacks by participants on the global model and inference attacks on participants' local data. To this end, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning security and privacy protection framework (BFLSP), design a model storage scheme on the blockchain, and add a node scoring mechanism as well as a node election scheme to ensure the security of the model and data during the training process while guaranteeing the accuracy of the model.

However, the extra resources and processing time taken up by the blockchain cannot be ignored, which poses a greater challenge to the task offloading problem for the service. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a more efficient fusion framework, FBMTO, which fully considers the balance between additional costs and performance improvements for task offloading in edge computing. The framework transforms the task offloading problem into a dual-objective optimization problem by fully considering the costs produced by the on-chain tasks. Then, we design a Blockchain-enabled Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning Task Offloading algorithm (BMARTO) to find the optimal offloading decision. In BMARTO, a novel reputation mechanism is introduced to speed up the optimization process while maintaining efficiency in the task offloading process. Additionally, we design an Edge-Computing Delegated Proof of Stake consensus algorithm (ECDPoS), an improved Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) that enabling high-throughput consensus operations in edge environments and boosting blockchain efficiency via a novel smart contract. Experimental results demonstrate that FBMTO reduces task latency and energy consumption while ensuring data security, outperforming existing methods in various scenarios.', 'Edge computing is an extension of IoT evolution and cloud computing technology development, which is closer to data sources and can provide low-latency and high-bandwidth service support to end users. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled offloading method for edge computing to address the data silos and high latency of service delivery in the healthcare industry, using a cloud-edge-chain three-layer underlying architecture model to achieve a joint design of task offloading and blockchain updates to improve the quality of healthcare services, and blockchain technology to provide authentication for edge service nodes to improve system security, data traceability, and user identity management. The results show that compared with the traditional reinforcement learning Q-learning algorithm, the computational offloading method of the DRLO algorithm designed in this paper converges faster and can effectively reduce the total system processing latency under the same conditions, with a 26% reduction in system processing latency and a 9.2% increase in reward value. Meanwhile, with the change of local terminal computing resources, the algorithm proposed in this paper can still keep the total system latency at a low level.', 'Blockchain, as an emerging technology, has gained widespread research in academia and industry due to its decentralization and traceability. As an important form of blockchain, consortium chains are often applied in the Internet of Things (IoT) to ensure the authenticity and reliability of data. Within consortium chains, the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) method is a key technology for ensuring the data consistency. It plays a central role in enhancing the system performance, security, and scalability. However, with the increase in the number of user nodes and the diversification of application scenarios, PBFT faces significant challenges in maintaining performance and security, particularly due to the increased communication overhead, longer consensus latency (CL), and risks of malicious attacks on the leader node. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a new blockchain consensus mechanism, namely the reputation awareness randomization consensus mechanism in the blockchain systems (RARCs). This mechanism first builds an evaluation model for the nodes, dividing them into ordinary nodes and candidate nodes through the reputation assessment. Second, it constructs a consensus node selection strategy to select the high-quality consensus nodes from the candidate nodes. Finally, RARC establishes a leader node randomization selection mechanism, increasing the unpredictability of the leader node and reducing the probability of the malicious attacks. Through the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the RARC can significantly reduce the CL, enhance the throughput, and increase the unpredictability of the leader node, thereby improving the performance and security of the blockchain systems.']"

However, maximizing the benefits of renewable energy sources calls for solutions to complex problems like intermittency, grid integration, and resource optimization. Data science has become increasingly important in recent years as a method for analyzing large datasets and deriving actionable insights from them. This paper investigates the relationship between data science and renewable energy, specifically how big data analytics can cause a paradigm shift in the renewable energy industry, improving efficiency, reliability, and sustainability.

Privacy protection in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is the core factor to improve user and vehicle participation. This article proposes a novel blockchain-based dynamic extensible privacy protection and message authentication scheme for VANETs. It minimizes the computation cost of message authentication based on an elliptic curve and message batch verification. Based on the Chinese remainder theorem, this scheme protects transmitted message security by adaptively and dynamically responding to vehicles and roadside units accessing the VANET. It offers a smart contract-based forensics and tracing solution from the accident vehicle. In addition, strict security proof and analysis that the scheme meets the security requirements for the VANET. It evaluates the efficiency of the scheme, and the results show its practicality.', 'The vehicles in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can be used to opportunistically gather and distribute the data in a smart city environment. However, at the same time, various security threats arise due to insecure communication happening among various entities in an IoV-based smart city deployment. To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves superior security and functionality features, and offers comparable storage, communication and computational costs as compared to other existing competing schemes. Finally, the blockchain implementation has been carried out on the proposed scheme to show its effectiveness.', 'The proliferation of intelligent transportation technology has led to an increased frequency of communication between vehicles. However, the openness of the Internet of Vehicles and wireless communication has introduced substantial privacy and security concerns, necessitating the adoption of identity authentication technology to ensure secure vehicle-to-vehicle communication. In response to the challenges posed by single point of failure and high computational costs in traditional centralized identity authentication schemes, this study proposes a blockchain-based batch authentication scheme for the Internet of Vehicles BBASV. By leveraging a non-pairing certificateless mechanism, the BBASV scheme effectively addresses these limitations, reducing the computational complexity and network traffic in the authentication process, thereby enabling efficient batch authentication. Additionally, identity-based prefix-key encryption is utilized to preserve the privacy of vehicle identities during proxy vehicle broadcasting. Moreover, the proxy vehicle leverages signature fusion technology to perform batch authentication on neighboring vehicles, alleviating the authentication burden on roadside units. The effectiveness of the BBASV scheme is rigorously evaluated through theoretical analysis and empirical experimentation, demonstrating its resilience against various security threats, including DoS attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and simulated attacks. Furthermore, the scheme exhibits favorable attributes such as low computational requirements and network traffic, rendering it a promising solution for ensuring secure and privacy-preserving communication within the Internet of Vehicles domain.']"

Criminals use phishing fraud to commit massive scams on Ethereum (one of the most widely used cryptocurrency platforms), which poses a significant threat to the security of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In this context, the use of Ethereum transaction information to detect and identify phishing fraud accounts is essential to ensure a secure and regulated trading platform. However, the previous proposals do not explore the behavior patterns of phishing accounts in depth, and also lack interpretability. To address this problem, we propose a novel and interpretable Ethereum phishing fraud detection method by extracting more fine-grained and interpretable account transaction features. The key idea is to extract both the spatial structure and temporal behavior patterns of the Ethereum transaction network as the “Translets” features via the highly interpretable attribute sub graphs and subsequences. Based on these features, a classifier with good interpretability is adopted, and the proposed interpreter is combined to interpret the detection outputs. The experimental results on real-world Ethereum phishing fraud account datasets demonstrate that our method not only has advantages in precision, recall, and F1 score but also provides interpretability in recognizing Ethereum phishing accounts.', 'The rise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has created new avenues for both lawful and illicit activities, including illegal firearm transactions. This study applies a combination of graph-based analysis, functional data techniques, and machine learning to detect and classify suspicious activities related to firearm trafficking on blockchain networks. A Random Forest model, achieving a precision of 0.907 and recall of 0.786, was used to identify illicit Bitcoin addresses, while a multi-target classifier categorized these addresses by specific types of illicit activity. For Ethereum, an XGBoost model achieved a precision of 0.9864 and an accuracy of 0.9901, demonstrating robust detection of suspicious accounts. Feature engineering and a rule-based system further enhanced model performance, though challenges remain in addressing misclassifications, particularly in distinguishing subtle transaction patterns. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning in blockchain forensics, providing critical insights for law enforcement efforts to combat illegal firearm trading.', 'To solve the problem of fraud detection in financial transaction data, this paper proposes an innovative detection scheme that integrates machine learning and big data analysis technology. We combine the subtleties of time series analysis with the power of modern data analysis to design a model that is both efficient and accurate in identifying financial fraud. First, advanced data acquisition technology is used to capture high-frequency financial transaction data in real time to ensure the freshness and integrity of data. Then, the ARIMA (autoregressive integral moving average) model is used to analyze these time series data in depth to reveal the hidden information behind the trading patterns and trends. On this basis, the LightGBM (Lightweight Gradient Elevator) algorithm is introduced, which is a machine learning tool that performs well when dealing with high-dimensional, sparse data, especially for complex data structures in the financial sector. By integrating the time series features mined by ARIMA with multi-dimensional information such as credit history and geographical location of both parties, as the input of LightGBM model, we construct a multi-modal fraud detection framework. Empirical research shows that compared with using ARIMA model alone or traditional machine learning methods, our hybrid model has achieved a significant breakthrough in the accuracy and response speed of fraud detection, which can not only perceptively capture abnormal transaction activities, but also proactively warn potential financial risk points.']"

However, the bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have brought huge economic losses, which has strengthened people's attention to the security issues of smart contracts. The immutability of smart contracts makes people more willing to conduct security checks before deploying smart contracts. Nonetheless, existing smart contract vulnerability detection techniques are far away from enough: static analysis approaches rely heavily on manually crafted heuristics which is difficult to reuse across different types of vulnerabilities while deep learning based approaches also have unique limitations. In this study, we propose a novel approach, Peculiar, which uses Pre-training technique for detection of smart contract vulnerabilities based on crucial data flow graph. Compared against the traditional data flow graph which is already utilized in existing approach, crucial data flow graph is less complex and does not bring an unnecessarily deep hierarchy, which makes the model easy to focus on the critical features. Moreover, we also involve pre-training technique in our model due to the dramatic improvements it has achieved on a variety of NLP tasks. Our empirical results show that Peculiar can achieve 91.80 % precision and 92.40 % recall in detecting reentrancy vulnerability, one of the most severe and common smart contract vulnerabilities, on 40,932 smart contract files, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Smartcheck achieves 79.37% precision and 70.50% recall). Meanwhile, another experiment shows that Peculiar is more discerning to reentrancy vulnerability than existing approaches. The ablation experiment reveals that both crucial data flow graph and pre-trained model contribute significantly to the performances of Peculiar."", ""Smart contracts have brought new developments to Blockchain technology, quickly finding widespread application in finance, law, and business sectors upon their emergence. However, security vulnerabilities in smart contracts have limited their growth. The existing methods for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts primarily focus on Ethereum's Solidity, lacking of vulnerability detection tools based on other smart contract languages such as C/C++. Therefore, this paper investigates the current state of vulnerability detection research for smart contract languages other than Ethereum's Solidity and proposes a vulnerability detection method for C/C++ smart contracts based on intermediate value transformation. This method combines Clang technology with the symbolic execution tool KLEE[l], utilizing the Intermediate Representation (IR) from LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) for research, andproduces a detection method capable of identifying eight types of code level vulnerabilities. Finally, it summarizes the current shortcomings of smart contract vulnerability detection methods and future research directions."", 'Compiling smart contracts into WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode format for better execution performance is becoming a common choice of many blockchain smart contract platforms, including EOSIO smart contract platform, which has been using WASM as its smart contract compilation target since its release. Similar to Ethereum smart contracts, EOSIO smart contracts have suffered from various vulnerability attacks, causing serious economic losses. Although some security analysis tools for EOSIO smart contracts have been proposed in the academic community, they still have some limitations, such as inadequate coverage of vulnerabilities and a lack of information about the triggered conditions and call stack when a vulnerability is identified. This makes it difficult for developers to utilize these tools. To address these problems, this paper proposes EOSVERIF, an automatic fine-grained analyzer of EOSIO smart contracts. It supports the concatenation of the set of vulnerabilities supported by all previous EOSIO security analysis tools and can provide the triggering conditions and execution paths of detected vulnerabilities. Our experimental results show that EOSVERIF can effectively detect vulnerabilities in EOSIO smart contracts.']"
