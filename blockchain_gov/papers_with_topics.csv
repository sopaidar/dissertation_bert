The Application of Blockchain Technology in E-Government in China,2017,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The purpose of this article is to discuss the application of blockchain technology in e-government, particularly in the Chinese context. Chancheng District, part of Foshan City in Guangdong Province, China, has undertaken a project called ""The Comprehensive Experimental Area of Big Data in Guangdong Province"" since 2016. Promoting the application of blockchain technology in e-government is an essential part of this undertaking, which is the first use of blockchain in government in China. Taking Chancheng's project as a case study, this article analyzes the framework, difficulties and challenges of applying blockchain to e-government at present, and discusses how blockchain technology can contribute to the development of e-government and public services in China. This article considers the practical realities in China and discusses the application of blockchain technology in Chinese e-government, finding that blockchain technology can bring the following benefits: (1) improvements in the quality and quantity of government services, (2) greater transparency and accessibility of government information, (3) development of information-sharing across different organizations, and (4) assistance in building an individual credit system in China. However, information security, cost and reliability are still major problems in application. Thus, establishing a general application platform of blockchain technology and developing management standards are crucial for promoting and applying blockchain in e-government. Blockchain provides an effective way of making government services more efficient, but standardizing the management system, processes and responsibility for the application is necessary for its further promotion. This article, by providing an analysis of the practice of blockchain in e-government in China, could serve as a foundation for further practical work and theoretical research in government services.",10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038519,H.

A Secure and Privacy-Preserving E-Government Framework Using Blockchain and Artificial Immunity,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9388310486202114,"Electronic Government (e-Government) systems constantly provide greater services to people, businesses, organisations, and societies by offering more information, opportunities, and platforms with the support of advances in information and communications technologies. This usually results in increased system complexity and sensitivity, necessitating stricter security and privacy-protection measures. The majority of the existing e-Government systems are centralised, making them vulnerable to privacy and security threats, in addition to suffering from a single point of failure. This study proposes a decentralised e-Government framework with integrated threat detection features to address the aforementioned challenges. In particular, the privacy and security of the proposed e-Government system are realised by the encryption, validation, and immutable mechanisms provided by Blockchain. The insider and external threats associated with blockchain transactions are minimised by the employment of an artificial immune system, which effectively protects the integrity of the Blockchain. The proposed e-Government system was validated and evaluated by using the framework of Ethereum Visualisations of Interactive, Blockchain, Extended Simulations (i.e. eVIBES simulator) with two publicly available datasets.

A Blockchain-Based Secure Mutual Authentication System for E-Government Services,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8544369876097636,"Throughout the last decade, the online e-governance platform's services have promoted engagement between individuals and institutions by completing different e-government transactions. To utilise the government platform's services, the user must first be granted access to the e-government, which is accomplished by two-factor authentication based on log-in and password through SMS or even three-factor authentication by adding smart cards. Due of the use of electronic government by the conventional techniques of the central server to transmit data, these services suffer from the issue of centralisation, which is represented by the danger of exposure to an attack that leads to a malfunction that may result in service disruption and closure. Moreover, these vulnerabilities exacerbated consumers' worries about their data's privacy and security. Blockchain technology protects and decentralises log-in information in our electronic authentication system. The evaluation demonstrated that blockchain-based authentication is feasible and manageable. By utilising blockchain technology, the proposed decentralised authentication model aims to create a secure architecture that fully protects the electronic governance platforms through the authorised access process of users, overcomes the problem of centralisation, and protects user log-in and credential information and data rights through the use of digital signatures, encryption, and hashing technologies. The results showed that the total time for the user account creation process took “0.8” seconds to generate the user's public and private keys, and less than “0.1” seconds to create the user certificate, and less than “0.1” second to create the user's transaction, while the total time for the user's access to e-government services took “0.1” second.",10.1109/ISCES58193.2023.10311497,H.

Identity theft on e-government/e-governance & digital forensics,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"In the context of the rapid technological progress, the cyber-threats become a serious challenge that requires immediate and continuous action. As cybercrime poses a permanent and increasing threat, governments, corporate and individual users of the cyber-space are constantly struggling to ensure an acceptable level of security over their assets. Maliciousness on the cyber-space spans identity theft, fraud, and system intrusions. This is due to the benefits of cyberspace-low entry barriers, user anonymity, and spatial and temporal separation between users, make it a fertile field for deception and fraud. Numerous, supervised and unsupervised, techniques have been proposed and used to identify fraudulent transactions and activities that deviate from regular patterns of behaviour. For instance, neural networks and genetic algorithms were used to detect credit card fraud in a dataset covering 13 months and 50 million credit card transactions. Unsupervised methods, such as clustering analysis, have been used to identify financial fraud or to filter fake online product reviews and ratings on e-commerce websites. Blockchain technology has demonstrated its feasibility and relevance in e-commerce. Its use is now being extended to new areas, related to electronic government. The technology appears to be the most appropriate in areas that require storage and processing of large amounts of protected data.

Resident-Centric Government EV Charging Stations using Blockchain technology,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8105410472263429,"The increase in demand for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations has resulted in varied charging rates by the privately-owned charging stations and imposes a necessity to make immediate payments corresponding to the charging amount. To address this issue, this paper proposes a government-operated charging station using blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and decentralized operations. Residents of a community are registered in a government-operated blockchain to charge their vehicles in a government-operated charging station. The authenticity of the resident is verified via a smart contract before permitting the blockchain charging transaction to occur. Using the blockchain network, the charging amount is added to the resident’s electricity bill for making the payment. This provides the resident a great relief from making immediate payment. Also, reward points are provided via the blockchain to the residents based on the energy consumed for the EV. In this process, residents benefit from uniform pricing across stations, secure transactions with cumulative payments, and automated billing with reward incentives.",10.1109/ICBDS61829.2024.10837447,P.

The Application of Blockchain in Sunshine Government Affairs : ——Student Allocation System As an Example,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8506108771631711,"In order to make the teaching resources fair, many cities now implement the allocation mechanism. But in the process of allocation, government staff needs to manually review a lot of work, which increased a lot of pressure to the education management department and wastes a lot of manpower and resources. Moreover, because there are persons take part in the allocation management, the public doesn’t have full trust in the allocation. In order to reduce the work pressure of government departments and improve the trust, the government should use blockchain technology to realize management system. By analyzing the business process of student allocation system, the system can store key data with alliance chain technology. Alliance chain breaks through the data barrier of information system among government departments. According to the characteristics of the alliance chain, this paper gave the overall design and business process analysis of the system, and the system experiment finally verified that the blockchain technology has very important significance and feasibility in the sunshine government.

DMap: A Distributed Blockchain-based Framework for Online Mapping in Smart City,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7849037812947397,"Smart cities are growing significantly due to the growth of smart connected vehicles and Internet of Things (IoT) where a wide range of devices are connected to share data. Online mapping is one of the fundamental services offered in smart cities which enables the vehicle owners to find shortest or fastest direction toward a destination thus reduces travel cost and air pollution. However, existing online mapping services rely on centralized servers, e.g., Google, which collect data from users to offer service. This method is unlikely to scale with growth in the smart city participants and introduces privacy concerns and data wall where data of the users is managed by big companies. To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce DMap, a blockchain-based platform where the users can share data in an anonymous distributed manner with service providers. To the best of our knowledge, DMap is the first distributed blockchain-based solution for online mapping. To improve the scalability of the blockchain, we propose to use edge-computing along with blockchain. To protect against malicious vehicles that may inject false data, we define a reputation system where the collected data of the vehicles is verified by monitoring the neighbor data.

Security sharing of smart city communication data based on blockchain technology,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.613464913858052,"When the smart city communication data is safely shared, the sharing process is mainly realized through single authorization attribute base encryption, and the key and ciphertext cannot be updated in time, which makes the encryption and decryption process in the data security sharing process take long. Therefore, relying on the blockchain attribute encryption algorithm, a new smart city communication data security sharing method is designed. Relying on the principle of attribute base encryption, the data encryption algorithm is designed to realize the encryption and decryption of smart city communication data. In chronological order, all encrypted data are stored on the block sharing chain, and the corresponding keys and ciphertext are quickly generated by the request of multiple nodes participating in joint computing. Finally, through the OBDD (orderly binary decision chart) access structure, the data on the sharing chain is efficiently accessed to realize the secure sharing of communication data.

Blockchain based Secure Data Storage Verification Algorithm for Smart City Environment,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.551285619079467,"Blockchain based distributed ledger mechanism has got a wide range of applications in this era. The degree of security measurement is always a bottleneck. Since there are technologies to break it. Data sharing through cloud for smart cities, collaborative actions, remote activities based on the data at the source, etc., need to be secure and free from masquerading and tampering. In most of the cases the data is pushed into the cloud from access points, sensors, or remote access centers. Preventing the data access and identifying anonymous access to these sensors require an enhanced security mechanism that prevents the inconsistent data to be transferred to the cloud. We propose a blockchain based enhanced security system that protects the data from the access point it leaves for the cloud using a distributed ledger. The consensus mechanism ensures the trust of existing sources during the data transfer from the source to the cloud. The trust generated by the subsequent data blocks with the security hash key ensure the integrity of the data and validity of the actual source. This prevent the illegal access to the data sharing points. We have verified the degree of security offered by our proposed model using informal analysis.

Blockchain Standards and Government Applications,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9078903479031702,"Many people talk about blockchain but very few understand its true nature and potential. Blockchain seems very exciting yet simultaneously a bit confusing, and naturally many people, businesses, and governments approach it with high expectations while also exhibiting some hesitancy. This article will deal with the use of blockchain in relation to government applications. A proper assessment of such use requires a discussion on blockchain standards, which are currently developed, or may develop in the future. Without blockchain standards, any potential use of blockchain in government will be of limited and restricted value. This would render our discussion on government applications rather limited too. Standards enable us to appreciate blockchain applications in a useful way for future applications outside the context of government. Focusing our attention to government applications is deliberate. Blockchain, obviously, provides amazing opportunities for the private sector. Over the last years there has been widespread public disbelief in many public and government institutions. Corruption, fraud, lack of transparency, alienation and disconnection of citizen from decision-making centres oblige governments to change and offer proper governance conditions for their citizens. Further, higher consumer expectations in all sectors of the economy naturally affect the expectations of citizens vis-à-vis their governments. For the above reasons, governments could leverage the positive features of blockchain to restore their reputation and efficiency towards citizens, by using blockchain. Of course, governments can use blockchain for many of their applications. To decide the proper application of blockchain within their operations, governments must embark on a need-based approach. Standards are extremely useful in such a need-based approach.",10.13052/jicts2245-800X.736,C. Aristidou; E. Marcou

To ensure positive outcomes for citizens, governments need the support of efficient public institutions with the capacity to keep track with emerging trends and changing expectations. The adoption of new technologies offers innovative opportunities for the public sector and can improve interactions between citizens and institutions and enabling citizen-centric services. The emergence of blockchain technology has inspired a new type of information exchange infrastructure on a peer-to-peer model that makes possible a set of use cases in sectors where improved efficiency, reliability, security and costs around transparency are intended. The public sector is mainly characterized by administrative processes that involve several institutions. If blockchain can promote various types of integration in an organization, the implications around its applicability and its interoperability in the complex integration of an inter-organizational public process remain to be demonstrated. In this paper, we investigate a real-life use case in public administration related to the vehicle registration process involving multiple institutions to develop an architecture that makes possible a blockchain-based digitalization of the inter-organizational process. We describe a case study and use it to extract the system requirements, analyze an approach that identifies coordination and data interoperability in public sector inter-organizational processes, and propose an architecture focused on transparency and privacy for effective deployment.

Blockchain-Based Government Fund Disbursal System using Blockchain and IPFS,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"In the modern landscape, most governments have financial incentives linked to most activities such as education in the form of scholarships, production and manufacturing in the form of production linked incentives (PLIs) and social security and retirement benefits. These social benefits sometimes take the form of giving financial assistance directly to the eligible in the form of bank transfers. However, these schemes are generally opaque in their operation in terms of allocation and timely disbursement of funds, leading to distrust in the government. This lack of transparency and inefficiency is generally attributed to corruption in local governmental bodies. Hence, a solution is required which introduces trackable and auditable disbursal of funds. Blockchain has been proposed as a viable solution for this purpose as fundamentally each transaction is recorded on a public ledger. However, multiple options exist for decentralized file storage such as Filecoin and Arweave, but they have built in incentives for pooling storage, leading to higher costs. And hence, the proposed model uses blockchain to execute smart contracts to establish the eligibility of an applicant, stores the applicant's necessary documents using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol, and transfers the funds in a decentralized manner.",10.1109/ISCS61804.2024.10581236,R.

However, most of existing e-government services are provided in a centralized manner and heavily rely on human individuals to control. The highly centralized IT infrastructure is more vulnerable to outside attacks. Also, it is relatively easy to compromise the data integrity by inside rogue users. Furthermore, relying on individuals to monitor and control some of the working flows makes the system error-prone and leaves room for corruption. To address these challenges, we propose to use the blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to improve the e-government system. The blockchain-based DAO system works in a fully decentralized way and is immune to both outside and inside attacks. At the same time, operations of such system is only controlled by pre-defined rules; thus, the uncertainty and errors caused by human processes are greatly reduced.

Blockchain-based Data Sharing Framework for Malaysia Government Aid Management System,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the world economy, and Malaysia is no exception. Due to the closure of businesses, the rate of unemployment has been recorded at an all-time high. The Malaysian Government through its agencies is assisting citizens through an online platform for incentives and an aid-giving platform. The current architecture of data sharing is using centralized, organization-oriented authentication and is not immutable for audit capability. In addition, the blockchain network is still a proof of concept in the digital government ecosystem. This paper studies the current aid data-sharing ecosystem and analyzes the potential of having a state government consortium blockchain framework that will be used in the Government Network Infrastructure for decentralized, transparent data sharing with audit capability. Several works involving Blockchain adoption based on domain, Blockchain consortium architecture and Government applications using blockchain are being presented. The need for a framework in implementing decentralized data sharing using consortium blockchain architecture for multi-agencies data sharing focusing on Malaysia Government Aid Management is discussed in this paper to provide the opportunity for the research domain. The findings in this paper will be used for future work on the requirement of a proposed government multi-layer consortium blockchain framework for data sharing in the Malaysian Government specifically for the Johore State Government ecosystem.",10.1109/ICDATE58146.2023.10248471,A.

Non-Intrusive Deployment of Blockchain in Establishing Cyber-Infrastructure for Smart City,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.909251657715229,"Internet-of-Things has emerged to develop smart communities so that real time sensing and decision can improve operational efficiency and quality of lives. However, establishing such infrastructure can be exceptionally intricate due to the vast variety of devices and the implemented technologies. Also, it poses several unique challenges, such as heterogeneity of the infrastructure, type, and scale of deployment, security, privacy, and inter-operability. One primary concern in a smart city environment is the capabilities of typically end-IoT devices which are vulnerable to security threats and prone to confidentiality and integrity breach of data. Blockchain can potentially address these security challenges due to the distributed ledger's inherent properties. In this paper, we propose a decentralized architecture using the Blockchain to provide a secure and resilient smart city infrastructure that can run the ledger service over a distributed network. We consider a permissioned Blockchain, Hyperledger Sawtooth, and to automate and to overcome the infrastructural challenges concerning the smart city deployment, and we provide a systematic methodology that automates the deployment process and saves a significant amount of time. We simulate and deploy a Blockchain-integrated smart city environment using the proposed seamless deployment strategy using our automation module. With the proposed deployment scheme, we improve the Blockchain-based infrastructure development time by 82% compared to the traditional deployment approach.",10.1109/SAHCN.2019.8824921,A. A.

Land Registry Using a Distributed Ledger,2022,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,1.0,"Land registration is a system that provides landowners with land titles secured by the government. Zimbabwe has no electronic system for keeping land registry records. Developing a system that automates, and keeps the land registry records immutable, is possible by creating a blockchain system that stores all the transactions made during the process. The immutability nature of blockchain offers plenty of security features that will protect the system from hacking and other malpractices from intruders. It uses strong cryptographic protocols and standards to secure the records stored in a block of data thus making it more reliable for the land registry to transfer the land ownership from a seller to a new buyer. This paper presents a system based on a Hyperledger Fabric distributed ledger that will record, store real-time transactions made during the process of land registration, thus decreasing the cases of fraud as immutable transactions are being stored in the permissioned distributed ledger network.",10.23919/IST-Africa56635.2022.9845584,N.

Enforcing the Security and Usability of Blockchain for a Smart City Cyberinfrastructure,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.851156256200971,"The development of smart cyberinfrastructures on the basis of the Internet of Things has caused the penetration of new technologies into the spheres of unmanned transportation, robotic buildings, and digital economy, and then, as a result of the integration of cyber-physical systems with monitoring, analytical, and control means, a new intelligent urban paradigm of a ‘smart city’. Noting the high criticality of this system, specific threats are aimed at disrupting its connectivity, resource capturing, functional availability, data privacy, and safety. As a protective measure, blockchain is a usual part of the security arsenal of any distributed system, providing provable security to all its participants. However, in a large-scale smart city's cyberinfrastructure, blockchain itself becomes a target of specific cyber threats, e.g., a ‘51% attack’. Also, the blockchain's usability issue is the unlimited growth of its structure, leading to exhaustion of free resources and thus depressing its use. Conventional approaches to preventing the blockchain from these issues downgrades its scalability and therefore are not widely applicable in a smart city. This paper proposes a new technique to protect the blockchain applied in a large-scale smart city network infrastructure. The proposed solution combines assessing the intruder's capabilities and providing dynamic adaptation of the blockchain to evolving threats. To avoid infinite growth of the blockchain, the blockchain with a floating genesis block and fixing blocks has been implemented. The developed modifications retain the ability to scale the blockchain. The experimental study has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",10.1109/RusAutoCon61949.2024.10694179,M.

Blockchain-Enabled Digital Transformation in Public Sector Portals: A Case Study of RTO Website Optimization,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5298549856051471,"This scholarly article examines the transformative capabilities of blockchain technology in optimizing the Regional Transport Office (RTO) System Portal, thereby improving efficiency, security, and transparency in the delivery of public services. As governments globally adopt digital transformation strategies, blockchain emerges as a formidable solution to address challenges including data integrity, fraud prevention, and procedural inefficiencies. This investigation conducts a critical assessment of the current RTO system, pinpointing deficiencies in user experience, security, and operational processes. To mitigate these identified challenges, we propose a Blockchain-Enabled Framework that incorporates Smart Contracts for automated verification and employs the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) Consensus Algorithm to guarantee secure, decentralized, and immutable transactions. Through a comparative evaluation of various consensus mechanisms, this paper elucidates the appropriateness of PBFT for permissioned governmental networks that necessitate robust fault tolerance and deterministic finality. The proposed framework significantly enhances vehicle registration, licensing, and document authentication processes, thereby markedly diminishing fraud, bureaucratic delays, and operational inefficiencies, thus providing a scalable and futureoriented solution for public sector portals.",10.1109/ICDSBS63635.2025.11031537,D.

BEMPAS: A Decentralized Employee Performance Assessment System Based on Blockchain for Smart City Governance,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7068566912448692,"In recent years, the use of blockchain has gained attention in industrial interventions and research. Blockchain technologies can be particularly utilized in the domain of Smart Governance, which is a critical component of Smart Cities. Smart Governance aims to ensure smarter decision making, openness and collaborative participation of all entities involved as well as help minimize resource usage, reduce consumption and save cost. Smart Governance involves putting in place systems for monitoring and evaluating the performance of government workers. However, government workers lack trust in these systems because they are mostly centralized systems which are prone to single-point of failure problems and also data fed into these systems can be tampered with by the higher-ups or employers to favour individual workers. With these problems, there is a need for a decentralized system that can ensure trust, tamper-resistance, accountability, reliability, transparency and security. In this paper, we propose a decentralized employee evaluation system based on blockchain. We utilized a 3-chain model, namely; ID-Chain, Behavior Chain and Credit Chain fused to make a single unified chain. Our system also makes use of an automated game-based employee evaluation approach. Our system is based on Hyperledger Fabric as the blockchain platform and operating mechanism. Our Proof of Concept (PoC) results shows that in utilizing the Blockchain system, security concerns such as trust, privacy, accountability, among others, that are present in current employee performance evaluation systems are tackled and also in the adoption of the game-based automated system, our system can make an effective decision regarding employee performance.

Impact of Government Dominance Over Blockchain Systems,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8464805145198518,"This paper investigates the possible risks of government intervention and control over blockchain technologies. Investigating the impacts of regulatory control on blockchain systems and whether it guarantees security and compliance or not helps one to determine if such dominance limits or guarantees innovation. By means of case studies of government-owned blockchain applications, this study investigates the equilibrium between decentralisation and governance. It studies possible hazards include censorship, less user control, and more monitoring. The study emphasises the requirement of a hybrid strategy wherein regulatory control guarantees security without endangering the dependability of distributed systems. The government should interact with blockchain and develop a hybrid model combining PSO and ACO if it is to maximise machine learning systems. Among the performance criteria the model considers when examining the effects of government policies are transaction speed, security, scalability, and energy economy. Apart from strengthening network resilience, the hybrid model facilitates decision-making and future intervention prediction. While still permitting some degree of decentralisation, the approach might assist governments and blockchain networks make choices.

Blockchain Enabling Government to Establish a Timely Supervision Mechanism for the Platform Ecosystem,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9076657037821091,"Blockchain technology has been applied to the government’s supervision mechanism of the platform ecosystem, considering the inaccurate timing of the Chinese government’s supervision of the platform ecosystem. This study establishes a game model to study the government’s decision-making behavior, total social welfare, and participants in the platform ecosystem. Research suggests that although government regulation can improve overall social welfare, excessive regulation inhibits the development of platform enterprises. Hence, this study further analyzes the government’s regulatory interval facing the platform ecosystem, constructs an application scenario of blockchain that enables timely government regulation, and establishes the regulatory interval as the trigger mechanism of smart contracts in the blockchain. The smart contract can send an alarm, and the government can intervene in the platform ecosystem for supervision if the evaluation result is within the regulatory interval. The government will not intervene in the platform ecosystem for regulation (if the government is inside the platform ecosystem at this time, the government will withdraw; if it is not inside the platform ecosystem, it will remain unchanged) if the assessment result exceeds the regulatory range.",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3316688,D. -L.

BlockChain to Prevent Fraudulent Activities: Buying and Selling Property Using BlockChain,2020,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,1.0,"Blockchain can have umpteen number of uses, one of them being its use in Real Estate. Blockchain and Real Estate go hand in hand. The kind of security and transparency needed in Real Estate is exceptionally provided by Blockchain. Consider a scenario where you buy a house. The proof that the property is owned by you is the deed or an agreement signed by the government which is physically present on a piece of paper and the records maintained by the government in the ledger. The procedure to this is simple; you buy the house, get it registered at the government office where they note it down in a register/ledger and you’ve got yourself a house. If the page in which your name is registered is torn or damaged, you might still own the house but apart from the deed, there will be no other concrete proof that the house is owned by you. So, you need to hope that you don’t lose the deed or someone doesn’t damage or misplace the government ledger. That’s the kind of guarantee you have. We propose a system which will help us to solve this problem. Suppose you wish to buy or sell property, you can provide the requirements asked for by the smart contract and get yourself a deed digitally which is uploaded as a new block in the chain.

The Real Estate Transaction Trace System Model Based on Ethereum Blockchain Platform,2022,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,0.6588714145392098,"Blockchain is one of the leading 4.0 technologies because of its potential applications in many fields, such as real estate. Real estate is an old market and little changes. Therefore, buying and selling real estate brings many risks because it is difficult to find and verify information. Real estate transactions are complex, time-consuming and have high intermediary fees. However, Blockchain technology has opened up many ways to change this. Therefore, we study Blockchain technology and propose Real Estate Transaction Trace (RETT) system model to change and improve the way real estate transactions work in Vietnam. The RETT system model is capable of managing and tracking the entire process of real estate transactions of all participants (owners, buyers, sellers, notaries). The government or real estate investor consortium can easily manage and trace all the purchase or lease transaction history of a property (land, town-house, apartment). We designed Blockchain network architecture, distributed ledger and smart contract. As a result, our method can digitize assets on the Blockchain, store decentralized transaction history, enable encryption, and direct transactions between sellers and buyers. In addition, our system model can reduce the problem of data explosion, execute multiple transactions at the same time, prevent data tampering and sensitive information disclosure. We have built a prototype of this system model based on the Ethereum Blockchain platform. Thereby, we have proven the effectiveness of RETT system model and practical applicability through experimental transactions. Our method improves transparency, eliminates intermediaries, saves costs and increases mutual trust in real estate transactions. Our system model can manage real estate transactions comprehensively and can be able to overcome the weaknesses of the current real estate transaction management system according to the Client-Server model. Therefore, our system model can be deployed in the smart city to manage and trace the entire real estate transaction.",10.1109/ICCAE55086.2022.9762429,V. Khoa Tan; T. Nguyen

In the framework, ASPs can flexibly delegate their authentication capabilities to the blockchain, and users authorized by different ASPs can be authenticated by the blockchain where the authentication events are publicly audited and traced. Since the blockchain is publicly accessible, users’ sensitive identity attributes may be exposed during the authentication process. To address privacy leakage caused by the authentication events, several privacy-preserving techniques, including threshold-based homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proof, and random permutation, are exploited to hide users’ sensitive information on the blockchain. Moreover, to improve user revocation efficiency, we integrate a cryptographic accumulator and secure hash functions into the framework where ASPs are allowed to revoke their users through a global revocation contract. Our security analysis shows that the proposed framework can achieve all desirable security and privacy properties, and a proof-of-concept prototype has been developed to demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the proposed framework.",10.1109/JIOT.2022.3154632,C.

Bitcoin revolutionized this conventional view of a cryptocurrency, trading decentralized, distributed ledger, completely secured by the majority rule without predetermined authority or owner. Only standard cryptographic primitives such as signatures and hash functions were used to achieve security. Though other cryptocurrencies such as Bit-gold and B-money which are among the authority-free cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the first one to experience public acceptance on a large scale. There are various factors which contribute to Bitcoins success, though there is still a little question of doubt that the decentralized design of blockchain technology and perceived resilience to government or third-party intervention played an extremely crucial role in its uptake. Distributed crypto cash, more specifically in Blockchain technology has hailed as one key and most eminent and widely accepted innovation of Bitcoin.

A Blockchain-Enabled Ecosystem for Distributed Electricity Trading in Smart City,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8393232278728469,"Along with the development in the Internet of Things technology and smart city, a distributed network has been formed among cities. This makes it easy to integrate distributed electric energy into the power grid, thus become an efficient way to use energy. However, how to guarantee the security and privacy protection of distributed electricity trading has not been solved effectively. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based electricity trading (B-ET) ecosystem and design a smart contract to ensure transactions are conducted in a safe and reliable manner. To overcome the shortcomings of high latency in traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, we proposed a credit-based PoW consensus mechanism by integrating the concept of “stake” to improve the consortium blockchain under the B-ET ecosystem. Then, we take combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system as an example that supplies distributed energy, and model its interactions with the agent of power grid by a novel Stackelberg game. We show that the optimal utilities of entities in a city can be obtained at the Stackelberg equilibrium by a distributed algorithm, which is guaranteed to exist and be unique. In the end, we conduct a number of numerical simulations to evaluate our proposed model and verify our algorithms, which demonstrate their correctness and efficiency completely.",10.1109/JIOT.2020.3015980,J.

Blockchain for smart cities: waste management with smart contracts,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7744032860790002,"The term Blockchain is a very popular and new technology today. Blockchain first emerged to verify file timestamp information and later became very popular with virtual currencies called Bitcoin. Blockchain technology has become so popular because it provides security, is not connected to a central system, its information is unchangeable, has a wide range of usage and offers a transparent structure. This technology is frequently used actively in many areas such as financial structures, healthcare services, buying and selling transactions, education, real estate transactions, smart cities and voting systems. One of the structures actively used on Blockchain is the smart contract structure. The smart contract which enables the contracts determined by the users to run automatically, is executed on a Blockchain network and automatically executes the desired transactions in a secure manner. Smart contracts can be used integrated into many areas and Blockchain structures. With the developing technology smart contract and Blockchain technology have begun to be used frequently in smart city projects. In particular they can be used in a variety of processes such as energy management, logistics, waste management, transportation, real estate, healthcare, utilities and administration. In this study a waste management example based on smart contracts was implemented using Blockchain technology. Because waste management is very important for smart cities. Waste management has an important role in many issues such as health, hygiene, environmental efficiency and resource management. For this purpose a smart contract-based waste management example has been developed. The developed sample contract includes the recycling process based on the collection of waste.

Health Record Management Using Blockchain Technology,2022,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,1.0,"The world is progressing, but it needs healthy people to succeed, and health records are a measure of human health across time. When health records are stored in a single system, data breaches might occur. A data breach will cost healthcare organizations $ 380 per record, according to estimates. Incidents reported to the federal government in 2021 resulted in the compromising of more than 40 million medical records this year. As a result, we switched to a record-keeping center, Which has not made a great deal of a difference. Because the patient has no control over the data, there is a high chance of it being mishandled. As a result, we require a patient-centered strategy that is entirely decentralized, capable of detecting data theft, preventing data tampering, and granting patients access control. Blockchain technology is the most effective way to solve all problems and meet all needs. As a decentralized and distributed ledger, blockchain has the potential to impact billing, medical research, identity theft, record sharing, and data crimes in the future. In the department of health, Smart contracts help to clarify things more particularly. On the Blockchain, invocation, record creation, and validation will all take place.

Official Document Management for Government Service in Indonesia using Smart Contract,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8377457274371303,"In general, the electronic official documents system is designed with a centralized system and managed by each government agency, so that data and records of official documents process activities are stored in a centralized database and managed by a single organizational unit. However, there are some disadvantages of this centralized system, especially in the workflow of official documents that involve more than one organizational unit. i.e. dependence on third parties which is the sole authority of the official documents data management. If there is a system failure there is a certain period of time, it will increase the activity cycle time and decrease activity time efficiency in the official documents business process. The blockchain-based solution described in this paper is to avoid the occurrence of delay times during the activity cycle time in business processes when a system failure occurs which can cause a decrease in activity time efficiency. Blockchain makes the official documents system become “Trusless Operation” with each participant of different organizational unit having a copy of transaction data through a consensus mechanism. The simulation results show that our system can reduce time delay in activity cycle time during a system failure as long as the number of faulty peers within the tolerance limit so that it can increase the activity time efficiency.",10.1109/ISC246665.2019.9071643,I.

Referenced Blockchain Approach for Road Traffic Monitoring in a Smart City using Internet of Drones,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5226974974724615,"The global escalation in the road traffic density alleviates the harmful emissions and fuel bills due to congestion and misaligned traffic control. The conventional traffic monitoring schemes (camera or sensor-based) are not able to cover every nook and corner and thus miss various vital traffic parameters that can otherwise be very useful for traffic density and pattern analysis. Internet of Drones (IoD) has been widely adopted to resolve various related challenges and has strong potential in traffic monitoring even in the areas where scarcity of fixed infrastructure is witnessed. Thus, in this paper, we have proposed an IoD-based traffic monitoring system to avoid the congestion on the roads within the available infrastructure. Moreover, to deal with the dynamic network typologies, an software-defined networking (SDN)-based centralized controller is configured to generate the flow rules for end to end data transmission. However, the drones communicate with each other through an open channel (now controlled through a programmable SDN architecture). Thus, the integrity of data collected by drones must be protected through a robust security mechanism. So, we have adopted a blockchain technology to secure the proposed system against unauthorised access and maintain data integrity. However, maintaining the entire blockchain on the drones can lead to several resource bottlenecks. Thus, we have used a referenced blockchain architecture that decouples the data from the blockchain part and stores it in the off-chain. The proposed scheme has been validated using simulated environments that validates its the superiority in contrast to the existing variants.",10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9838264,M. P. Singh; A. Singh; G.

Blockchain Based Direct Benefit Transfer System For Subsidy Delivery,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8654747200955818,"Delivery of subsidies to deserving beneficiaries forms an essential part of government expenditure. In 2018-19 alone, the Government of India spent $60 Bn on welfare subsidies, majorly through the Public Distribution System(PDS). Of this amount, it is estimated that 40% was lost in the form of misuse, corruption and related inefficiencies in the system. Recognising this problem, the government began Direct Benefit Transfers in 2013 for a select few schemes, for instance, LPG subsidy. Using Aadhaar and biometric tokens for validation, the beneficiaries would receive the subsidy as direct cash transfers to their bank accounts. However, in reality, the DBT program has had the same efficiency as the PDS. According to the analysis of the DBT policy, the key drawbacks of this system are lack of auditability, inability to control the use of funds for intended purposes, and over-reliance on the banking infrastructure, which is underdeveloped in the rural areas. In order to plug loopholes in the DBT system, we propose a blockchain-based system. Blockchain consists of cryptographic hash secured distributed ledgers which maintain an immutable log of transactions between all participants of a blockchain network. They have the ability to execute Smart Contracts, which allow for automation of execution of real-world contracts given that certain specified conditions are met.

Risk-Averse Ride-Hailing Platform Operations With Safety Risk-Averse Consumers Under Pandemics: Roles of Blockchain Technology and Government Sponsors,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Today, ride-hailing platform operations are popular. Facing pandemics (e.g., COVID-19) some customers feel unsafe for the ride-hailing service and possess a “safety risk-averse” (SRA) attitude. The proportion of this type of SRA customers is unfortunately unknown, which makes it difficult for the ride-hailing platform to decide its optimal service price. In this article, understanding that blockchain technology (BT) based systems can help improve market estimation for the proportion of SRA customers, we conduct a theoretical study to explore the impacts that the BT-based system can bring to the platform, customers, and drivers. We consider the case in which the platform is risk-averse (in profit) and serves a market with both SRA and non-SRA customers. We analytically prove that using BT, the optimal service price will be increased and BT is especially helpful for the case with a more risk-averse ride-hailing platform. However, whether it is more or less significant for the more risk-averse SRA customers depends on their degree of risk aversion. We uncover that when the use of BT is beneficial to the customers, it will also be beneficial to the drivers, and vice versa. We derive in closed-form the analytical conditions under which the use of BT can be beneficial to the ride-hailing platform, customers, and drivers (i.e., achieving “all-win”). When all-win cannot be achieved automatically, we explore how governments can provide sponsors to help. We further extend the analysis to consider the general case in which BT incurs both a fixed cost as well as a cost increasing in demand. We prove that the main conclusion remains robust. In addition, we reveal that the required amount of government sponsor to achieve all-win is the same between the two different costing models explored in this article.",10.1109/TEM.2023.3263854,T. -M.

Hybrid Blockchain Model to Improve Information Privacy Security and Transparency of Drug Sales Transactions,2025,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.8561292298872992,"The process of transforming raw materials into finished drugs, which consumers or patients then distribute and consume, is known as the drug supply chain. The drug supply chain process involves many parties, from suppliers of raw materials for drugs, companies that produce drugs, and drug distributors to consumers and the government that makes regulations to monitor drug distribution. To increase transparency and validity of transaction information along the drug supply chain, several studies have adopted blockchain technology. By adopting blockchain technology, all stakeholders in the drug supply chain can get transparent and valid information. The weakness of previous research on the drug supply chain is that it only uses private blockchain to connect suppliers, manufacturers, and drug distributors. Customers and patients have the right to verify the authenticity of the drugs they take. Therefore, the use of a private blockchain in the drug supply chain is ineffective, as it prevents consumers and patients from accessing information about the authenticity of the drugs. So this research aims to build a hybrid blockchain model that combines private and public blockchains for the drug supply chain to provide transparent and valid information for consumers/patients. Private blockchain involves suppliers, manufacturers, and drug distributors, while public blockchain will connect consumers/patients to the system. The research uses a qualitative approach through literature review. Research output in the form of simulation results with Hyperledger fabrics proves that hybrid blockchain can increase information transparency for suppliers, producers, distributors, and consumers/patients.",10.1109/OTCON65728.2025.11070832,Inayatulloh
Blockchain framework for real-time streaming data generated in image sensor networks for smart monitoring,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8090900861738909,"The smart city concept is attracting increasing attention from society. Smart monitoring, which enables the detection and prevention of road traffic accidents, is one promising application of the smart city concept. The deployment of three-dimensional (3D) image sensor networks formed by light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices interconnected via a network is a key enabler for smart monitoring. Data collected by image sensor networks for smart monitoring are sensitive because the usage of the data is often related to public safety or law enforcement. Managing sensor data using the blockchain technology is one way to address these sensitivity concerns, as a blockchain network helps prevent data from being tampered with even by the administrators of the system. However, prior works have not considered how to handle streaming data such as image sensor data generated by LIDAR devices in real-time, which means there is a risk of overflow in the network if the data are handled frame by frame. In response to this issue, we propose a blockchain framework for real-time monitoring in a smart city using image sensor networks. Our key concept with this framework is to aggregate hash values converted from multiple frames of image sensor data into one hash value. The proposed framework reduces the number of data ‘writes’ on a blockchain network, thus preventing any overflow. Our framework also enables the estimation of the optimal number of aggregated hash values that minimizes delay while avoiding overflow. Measurements taken in actual environments using a real-world LIDAR dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",10.1109/BRAINS49436.2020.9223311,D. Masuda; R. Shinkuma; Y.

Student Management Model Integrating E-Commerce Based on Blockchain Technology,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Blockchain is one of the most prominent technologies today. With a combination of cryptography, distributed computing, consensus algorithms, and peer-to-peer networking, blockchain technology is a distributed network with strong security. This technology opens up a new opportunity to improve the performance of other sectors such as supply chain, finance, smart city, smart health, education, e-commerce, and more. For education, blockchain technology offers the same application potential as for other professions. E-commerce is no exception to the influence of this technology. Therefore, we design a student management model integrating e-commerce based on blockchain technology (SMM-EB). This model is maintained by tokens. At the same time, this model uses blockchain technology to store student information and distribute rewards in cryptocurrency. Students can use that currency in exchanges and transactions within the scope of a school or an education on the e-commerce platform. Our method makes the process of verifying student personal information and achievements quick and accurate. At the same time, this method also overcomes fraud in e-commerce. Thanks to blockchain technology, this model-based system ensures the transparency and integrity of student information and transactions on the e-commerce platform. Therefore, the system is more secure and efficient than the centralized system and does not depend on third-party management.

A Novel P2P based System with Blockchain for Secured Voting Scheme,2019,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,1.0,"The revolution in the system of records has reached a great extent and paves a way for a powerful technology known as blockchain for storing data and performing transactional operations in a decentralized network. Blockchain was first developed to serve as a public transaction ledger for the cryptocurrency named “Bitcoin”. Later, One such application is the online balloting scheme. A ballot is a device that is used to cast the votes in an election. In ballot based voting, still there is no system to avoid proxy casting and recasting. We do not have any technology to view our casted votes. In the electronic voting system based on Blockchain, addresses some of the limitations in the existing systems and labels some of the issues of e-voting. The idea in blockchain enabled balloting scheme is to integrate Aadhaar card and Mobile number of the people using which the OTP is generated and then the voter is allowed to cast their vote. Ethereum is an open source blockchain based technology that uses both private blockchain and remix platform and it acts as a tool in storing the data. The user can cast their votes from anywhere (nearby booth) and the corresponding contestant are notified to the users based on their constituency and candidate promises. If NOTA votes crossed above 50%, then all the candidates are disqualified and are permitted to contest for the next election. If any of the citizen do not poll their vote, then a warning message will be sent to the respective person. They should provide a valid reason for not voting within a period of 6 months, if the reason is invalid then necessary action will be taken by the government. If a member of citizen wants to view his/her voting status then they can view it by entering their aadhar number and the block number that is sent to them through the mobile app. The implementation of this system addresses most of the issues faced in the balloting scheme and is used to avoid proxy casting and recasting and is also used to achieve above 95% of the vote.",10.1109/ICONSTEM.2019.8918895,V.

Various proposed use instances of blockchain in tax collection can possibly trigger an upheaval in the manner in which governments gather and spend their monies. As much as individuals may abhor paying them, charges are important to empower the customary working of countries and economies. Despite the fact that administrations don't work revenue driven like organizations, they do expect to subsidize to take care of expenses for the administrations they give to general society. Be that as it may, most governments neglect to recoup a noteworthy part of the assessments owed to them and work under money related obligation and shortfall, which, in the long haul may prompt financial stagnation and a decrease in the nature of open administrations. In this way, recuperating charges is the best money related need for governments.

The Blockchain Conceptual Model to Prevents Fraud and Increase Transparency In The Presidential Election In Indonesia,2023,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,1.0,"The presidential election in Indonesia is a national leadership change activity that is carried out every 5 years. Presidential election activities already have their own mechanisms, starting from the voting by citizens throughout Indonesia to the announcement of the results of the presidential election calculations. Voting by citizens is carried out at all polling places (TPS), and the votes acquired by the presidential candidate are counted. The calculation results are collected in stages up to the national level and converted into digital data. The problem is that there is no transparency in the vote counting system because there is no single party that can oversee the government’s vote counting system. The potential for fraud can occur considering there are hundreds of millions of voters with layered stages of collection and calculation. On the other hand, blockchain technology can display valid and transparent data. Thus, the aim of this research is to build a model for adopting blockchain technology for presidential elections in Indonesia. The research method uses a qualitative approach with several stages, such as identifying problems in conventional presidential elections, identifying features in the prototype, and building a model by considering the technicalities of blockchain adoption in the model. The main result of this research is a prototype for presidential elections using blockchain technology. By adopting blockchain technology in the Indonesian presidential election, it will increase the validity and transparency of voting results. In this way, all forms of fraud can be eliminated. The research results will also present examples of data simulations using blockchain technology and user interface designs for blockchain technology-based presidential election systems.",10.1109/ICCED60214.2023.10425635,Inayatulloh; I.

Scalability issues in e-voting systems, blockchain technology, and voter authentication modules combined altogether render the mass adoption and use of blockchain-based e-voting systems either partial or fully decentralized not feasible. This work studies a zk-SNARK authentication module for voter identity verification and validation in a blockchain-based e-voting application. The load testing was conducted to observe the system's throughput, speedup, and efficiency under two scenarios: with and without a load balancer, as implementing a blockchain-based e-voting might be partially decentralized with government intervention in certain parts of the process. The zk-SNARK authentication module studied in this work preserves users' privacy and eliminates the need for a password-based authentication system. However, the scalability evaluation shows a sub-linear speedup and efficiency of the zk-SNARK authentication module, leading to poor system scalability.",10.1109/SCISISIS61014.2024.10760236,A.

Blockchain-Enabled E-Voting: A Path To Secure And Transparent Elections,2024,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,1.0,"Elections are the cornerstone of democracy, enabling citizens to express their opinions and shape governance. However, traditional voting systems are often centralized, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. Blockchain technology, being decentralized and secure, offers a solution. A blockchain is a digital record that is distributed in chain of blocks, where every block holds data, a previous hash, and its own hash. Any change to a single block affects the entire chain, making tampering extremely difficult. These blocks are cryptographically linked, ensuring that data is continuously adapted and shared across a peer-to-peer network, where no single entity can alter the information. The blockchain’s immutability and transparency guarantee that voting data and application code remain unaltered, with each vote securely recorded and distributed across multiple nodes, enhancing security and resistance to attacks. Additionally, blockchain supports remote voting, increasing accessibility for those unable to vote in person. Estonia, a pioneer in adopting blockchain for government services, including e-voting, has seen significant growth in voter’s participation, with 44% of voters casting their ballots online in the 2019 parliamentary elections, a marked increase from previous general elections.",10.1109/AECE62803.2024.10911231,S.

However, SMEs have many limitations that hinder their development. Limitations in knowledge, finance, technology, marketing, and human resources are fundamental problems that hinder the development of SMEs. Several efforts have been made to help SMEs develop their businesses, one of which is a partnership program with large companies. Large companies can provide support in terms of financing, training, marketing, and product development to SMEs as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and also involve the government. However, currently there is no monitoring mechanism that provides transparent and valid information regarding collaboration activities involving SMEs, large companies, and the government. Thus, the aim of this research is to build a blockchain model to increase the transparency of information on collaboration/ partnership activities involving SMEs, large companies, and the government. The research uses a qualitative approach through a literature review to identify SME partnership problems. Literature reviews are also used to study the concept of blockchain technology, which can be adopted as a solution to SME partnership problems.

Blockchain-based Digital-Voting: Effectiveness and Challenges in Afghanistan,2019,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,1.0,"In today's world, the democratic process of voting is made more critical as this process usually interfered by power hungry actors, especially in corrupted governments. People mistrust the government as their human rights and fundamental constitutional freedoms are violated. In such an environment, providing a transparent and secure voting system is a key to gain back the trust of the citizens. The traditional paper-based or digital voting system has several problems encountered as it is managed by a single organization having fully control of the system and database. This organization can tamper with the database, and can easily eliminate the traces. Furthermore, these systems have also encountered problems like security of people, security and privacy of data, time consumption, and potential system attacks. In modern world it is possible to build a transparent voting system to address these security credentials of current voting systems. The technology which paves the ground for this new generation voting system is called Blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed, transparent and unchangeable database of continually growing data records that ensures the truth of data by providing public inspection of votes cast for a candidate in a secure, anonymous and verifiable way. Core tent of this voting system is to remove all need for ""trust"" and place strong emphasis on open End to End verification of the process and votes. The implementation of proposed system will result to higher voter turnout as it has substantial benefits and brings more easing to cast a vote. The implementation of proposed system in Afghanistan may also encounter some challenges such as cyber security hacks, digital devices and internet access requirement, and low literacy rate. To avoid these obstacles the government can make some alternate arrangements to make it more secure and reliable. This research focused on effectiveness and challenges of this new generation voting system in Afghanistan.",,M. H. Hedayati; J. A. Baktash; O. S. Mohmand

Managing COVID-19 Test Certificates Using Blockchain Platform,2021,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.9046993661046844,"In early 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic is caused by the emergence of a new type of coronavirus which spreads very quickly. Because of this pandemic, the government has issued health protocols that use a lot of COVID-19 tests. However, cases of forgery of test certificates often occur in paper-based test certificate. To overcome this problem, we propose a COVID-19 test certificate management system using blockchain technology. By using blockchain technology, the system can be used by multiple entities, even though the entities that use it do not have trust relationship beforehand. This is possible because blockchain is a technology that uses a decentralized network that can store its data with a secure consensus mechanism. The system built using the Ethereum platform, which is a public non-permissioned blockchain that supports decentralized application development through smart contracts that executed via EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The system has been developed using 3-layers architecture, which contains network, software, and application layer. The evaluation shows that the system successfully fulfills the COVID-19 test certificate management requirement. The system can be used for tester registration, and create, revoke, display certificates. Furthermore, by using encryption and digital signature mechanism, the system can protect patient privacy and data integrity. The system has also succeeded in fulfilling the availability and security requirements.

With this increased use of new technologies, the security problem is becoming more and more important because complex systems lead to unpredictable security vulnerabilities, which result in financial and private information losses. As a recently emerged technology, Blockchain was emerged as an alternative solution to security breaches of a different application environment. In contrast to the central structure used by most systems, it is preferred especially in the area of security by its distributed structure and the cryptographic hash algorithm it uses. Today, structures such as Smart Home, Smart City, Smart Environment and Smart Agriculture, which are created by using IoT are seen as active research areas with more security shortages. The reason for the security weakness in these areas arises from the hardware restriction on the IoT devices used. In the proposed system, an authorization system for IoT devices has been tried to be set up by using the distributed node structure of Blockchain system and blocks kept in these nodes. UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which uses a simple communication model without establishing a connection to the minimum protocol mechanism for communication of nodes in the system, was preferred.

Design of Blockchain DApps to Simplify GST and Letter of Credit Processes in Deregulated Financial Services,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8618754072315539,"Most banking sectors and government entities depend on a centralised mechanism to perform various operations. This mechanism is often slow, inefficient, and unreliable. The Government levies Goods and Service Tax (GST) on the supply of goods and services. GST is a complex multistage indirect tax law applied from manufacturing to the end-user. The current GST implementation has a few loopholes where a seller can easily evade tax payments. Similarly, a Letter of Credit (LC) is a trade process mediated by banking partners. This process is often manual for sharing and validating documents between traders with or within countries for commerce. This paper explores the possibility of implementing GST and LC processes using blockchain technology and aims to address some of the issues faced in the current system. This paper proposes a decentralised application (DApp) to ease the operation logic of GST or e-way bills using smart contracts.

Indian Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain Technology and CNN,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8730212176377615,"India is a key player in the global food production industry. Indians have been cultivating land since the Indus Valley Civilization. Although historically significant, this country’s farmers are starving to death while their counterparts in other countries receive the benefits of their labour to the tune of billions. Lack of proper supply chain management is a contributing factor. It’s common knowledge that poorly cared-for farming machinery quickly deteriorates. However, current methods of supply chain management do not enable farmers to track the whereabouts of their commodities, even though the government supplies them with storage facilities. Since no system is in place, they have no idea where their packages are at any one time during the shipping process. Therefore, there is a need for more stringent supply chain management, including checks at each level and double-checking by farmers and government officials to ensure the integrity of goods. This study suggests implementing Blockchain technology, which allows for more transparent information on the status of commodities, to enhance the relationship between producers and consumers. By recording this information on the blockchain, all of the farmers and government employees involved in the shipping process can stay apprised of the operation’s finer points.

Land Registry Using Blockchain - A Survey of existing systems and proposing a feasible solution,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9746081867693038,"Storing sensitive information like property papers needs a secure and untamperable database. Existing centralized systems has numerous drawbacks like performance bottleneck and single point of failure. Hence, a decentralized system with high security is needed. To cater this need, in this paper, we propose blockchain based system for secure storage of property papers. In our system, when a land is bought by a person, the government authority will provide the person with the hard copy of property papers and our system will store the documents into the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS), a decentralised database. The IPFS network will generate the hash of document. This hash will be securely stored into the ethereum blockchain after satisfying the conditions of the smart contracts. The smart contracts will validate and verify the documents from the government authorities. This will create a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger from which we can retrieve the stored data easily.",10.1109/ICCUBEA47591.2019.9129289,D. Shinde; S. Padekar; S. Raut; A. Wasay; S. S. Sambhare
Data Access & Sharing Approach for Trade Documentations Based on Blockchain Technology,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6281317145678063,"Nowadays, there are many documents involved in cross-border trade transactions. A multitude of documents have to be inter-exchanged between two main categories of actors: businesses(B) and government authorities(G). However, one of the important problems is how to effectively control access to documents and securely share documents in the scenario of national G2G and certain B2G border procedures. In order to achieve fine-grained access control and secure sharing in crossborder trade transaction electronic platform, we present an attribute-based encryption(ABE) approach for trade document access and sharing using blockchain technology in this paper. In this approach, a user’s private-key is associated with a set of attributes, a document ciphertext with an access policy over a defined universe of attributes stores to the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), and then the simple hash of IPFS files is kept on the blockchain. Through using smart contract in blockchain technology, the proposed mechanism of data access control and sharing can ensure the access control information is tamper-resistant, auditability and verifiability.",10.1109/EITCE47263.2019.9095045,T.

Blockchain-Based Autonomous Notarization System Using National eID Card,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9249995097538253,"In recent years, the spread of information and communication technology has led to the emergence of e-government, which is the electronic replacement of government services. E-government is said to be compatible with blockchain technology, which has led to various studies on the possibility. Notarization, one of the functions of the government, has particularly been examined for the potential adoption of blockchain technology. However, because the notary public must authenticate the document’s contents during the notarization process, they have been difficult to replace with smart contracts. In this study, we focus only on fixed date notarizations and propose a fully automated notarization system by combining a national eID card with Public Key Infrastructure and smart contracts. A fixed date is a notarization that allows a notary public to guarantee that a document existed, regardless of the authenticity of the document’s content. Therefore, it can be replaced by a smart contract. Specifically, our proposed system automatically authenticates the creator and the document for electronic documents signed with a national eID card and uses the transaction receipt generated when the information is stored on the blockchain as a certificate of notarization. Verification of the signed data is done inside the blockchain by smart contracts, which eliminates the need for a verification authority. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a Japanese use case as proof of concept.",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3199744,S. Haga; K. Omote

Blockchain based solution to improve the Supply Chain Management in Indian agriculture,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8629906948079188,"India is one of the agriculture-based country in the world. The history of agriculture in India starts from Indus Valley Civilization. But in such a historical country, many farmers are starving for their income while foreign countries are earning lakhs from the same. One of the reasons for the above cause is the very poor supply chain management. It is a well-known fact that most of the farming items decay very fast if not maintained properly. In the existing supply chain management, though the government provides storage houses for the farmers, the farmers could not track the status of their goods. Also, there is no proper system for tracking the status of their goods in the various stages of transportation. Hence, an improved supply chain management is needed with the desired properties such as checkpoints at every stage in the supply chain management, verification of goods status by both the farmers and the government officials. In this paper, a system is proposed that uses Blockchain technology to attain the transparency about the goods' status that leads to a healthier relationship between the producer and consumer. By storing the details in the blockchain, all the process is visible both to the farmers and officials involved in the transportation.

Permissioned Blockchain Voting System using Hyperledger Fabric,2022,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,0.5855043253925268,"Elections are an integral part of democracy. With democracy being the most popular government type in today’s world, the need for the use of free and fair elections to elect a presidential candidate or a party has increased. Elections allow everyone in the country above a certain age group (Age limit as per a country or state’s norms) irrespective of their gender, caste, color, religion, etc., to take part in election and vote for the candidate or party of their choice. The most popular methods of conducting elections are using ballot paper and electronic voting machines (EVM’s). These methods come with their own set of challenges such as lack of security, inefficiency, bogus voting, increased expenditure and ease of manipulation of the props used for voting. In order to tackle these challenges, we are proposing an implementation of elections by making use of permissioned blockchain technology.

Performance Analysis of Blockchain in Tendering Process based on Hyperledger Framework,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8407169677821762,"Tendering is a lengthy and complex business process that results in several legal obligations associated with corporate contracts. Several Asian governments used an e-tendering system to carry out the tender procedure. By facilitating the procurement process with linked parties, e-tendering attempts to promote productivity, effectiveness, and transparency in the tender process. Problems with the e-tendering system remain centralized, giving local groups complete control over the database and system, increasing the risk of fraud, collusion, and manipulation. To avoid bidder fraud and suspicion, the highly competitive contract selection process must be supported by effective and transparent technology. Blockchain is one of the solutions that enable integrated systems without a third party because it conforms to the decentralized nature of distributed databases, copies of which are held by many users, allowing each system user to adopt transparent and distributed control measures.

Security System for Digital Land Certificate Based on Blockchain and QR Code Validation in Indonesia,2022,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,1.0,"In this research, we developed a land certificate security system based on blockchain technology and a qr code validation scheme to prevent counterfeiting of land certificates and illegal levies in the process of making land certificates in Indonesia. The process of making land certificates is currently still being carried out by involving various related parties so that it requires a complex and long process. This triggers cases of illegal levies carried out by related parties on the grounds of speeding up the process of obtaining land certificates, thereby reducing the transparency aspect. Conventional paper certificates are prone to forgery and easy to lose, besides that electronic certificates designed by the government still use the concept of a centralized system, so they are vulnerable to being hacked. Another problem is the falsification of ownership of land certificates by the land mafia. Therefore, a land certificate security system is needed for the online land certificate data storage process.

Enhanced Proxy Re-Encryption With Blockchain For Privacy-Preserving IOT Data Exchange,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.927506825307966,"The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant challenges in maintaining data security, integrity, and privacy, particularly in dynamic and multi-user environments where sensitive information is frequently exchanged across distributed networks. Conventional security mechanisms often fall short in addressing the unique demands of IoT systems due to their limited scalability, vulnerability to advanced cyber threats, and the need for real-time data processing. To address these concerns, this paper presents a novel and secure data-sharing architecture that seamlessly integrates Homomorphic Proxy Re-Encryption (HPRE) with blockchain technology. The proposed HPRE mechanism empowers a trusted proxy to re-encrypt ciphertext for designated recipients without accessing the original plaintext, thereby enabling flexible, privacy-preserving information exchange among authorized users. This allows IoT data owners to maintain control over their data while securely delegating access rights in a controlled and verifiable manner. To enhance accountability and eliminate single points of failure, a blockchain-based ledger is employed to immutably record all encryption operations, key-sharing events, and data access transactions. This integration guarantees transparency, traceability, and tamper-resistance, fostering a trustless environment suitable for highly sensitive IoT applications such as healthcare monitoring, industrial automation, and smart city infrastructures. Additionally, by incorporating lattice-based cryptography within the HPRE framework, the system achieves strong post-quantum security guarantees, rendering it resilient against both classical and emerging quantum computing threats. The proposed architecture is designed to be scalable, lightweight, and adaptable to heterogeneous IoT ecosystems, making it a reliable and future-proof solution for secure data exchange in privacy-critical applications. Experimental results and security analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the system in real-world IoT scenarios, confirming its potential for widespread adoption in next-generation secure IoT networks.",10.1109/ICCRTEE64519.2025.11053119,A.

Blockchain Applied In Decentralization of Ground Stations To Educational Nanosatellites,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7125494888524359,"Space has increasingly attracted the attention of governments, large industries, and universities. One of the most popular strategies in recent years has been the adoption of nanosatellites to fulfill different missions, which can work alone or in constellations. Universities stand out among the agents launching nanosatellites, with more than 600 launches until 2022. Given the growth of entities that control space missions, it is necessary to implement new methods for communication between control and satellite to accelerate data transmission and provide a high-security degree. Our work proposes a consortium archi-tecture between Ground Stations (GSs) so that a GS as a Service (GSaaS) works with low cost, reliability, and resource sharing. We simulated a nanosatellite mission in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with MATLAB to obtain the parameters of average communication time, propagation loss, and at which angles the communication would be most affected by atmospheric phenomena. Then, we implement business rules for communication between GS and satellites using smart contract concepts. We set up a blockchain to provide the decentralization infrastructure and created a web service to provide a communication API between nanosatellite and blockchain. We simulated the firmware update process, showing that the nanosatellite took around 20 minutes to request all 32-byte fragments of 301 Kb firmware. Considering the time interval that the communication window between GS and nanosatellite remains active, the entire firmware transmission takes two to three communication slots. However, the transmission time is drastically reduced in a scenario with two or more GSs. Furthermore, the GSaaS decentralized infrastructure allows the consortium of GSs to communicate agnostically with the satellites, preserving firmware privacy due to the cryptography used in blockchain transactions",10.1109/LATS58125.2023.10154485,E.

Analyzing the Federated Byzantine Agreement Blockchain Network for Liveness Using Multiple Online Analytical Processing,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.49899765370299026,"Blockchain technology is widely implemented in various fields, such as government, health, and agronomy. However, various security vulnerabilities and issues related to the validation speed hinder the adoption of blockchain technology. Blockchain consensus systems have been developed to address these issues, including the Proof of Stake and its variants, as well as the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and its variants. PBFT excels in quickly resolving system validations but faces capacity limitations. To address the limitations of this consensus system, the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) was developed. FBA relies significantly on network liveliness and security, necessitating an investigation of the underlying causes of network liveliness issues within the FBA framework. This study focuses on a real FBA network that operates on a stellar network. The analysis employed the Multiple Online Analytical Processing (MOLAP) method, revealing that MOLAP is a viable approach for examining networks affected by inactive nodes that pose a challenge in establishing a quorum, albeit with potential solutions through the use of thresholds. Nevertheless, a security loophole is identified due to the quorum being concentrated within a single organization, and further issues arise when nodes become overloaded, rendering them unverifiable.",10.1109/InCIT60207.2023.10413163,E.

Increase Activity Time Efficiency in Official Documents Management using Blockchain-based Distributed Data Storage,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8554532389378307,"In general, the electronic official documents system is designed with a centralized system and managed by each government agency, so that data and records of official documents process activities are stored in a centralized database and managed by a single organizational unit. However, there are some disadvantages of this centralized system, especially in the workflow of official documents that involve more than one organizational unit. i.e. dependence on third parties which is the sole authority of the official documents data management. If there is a system failure there is a certain period of time, it will increase the activity cycle time and decrease activity time efficiency in the official documents business process. The blockchain-based solution described in this paper is to avoid the occurrence of delay times during the activity cycle time in business processes when a system failure occurs which can cause a decrease in activity time efficiency. Blockchain makes the official documents system become “Trusless Operation” with each participant of different organizational unit having a copy of transaction data through a consensus mechanism. The simulation results show that our system can reduce time delay in activity cycle time during a system failure as long as the number of faulty peers within the tolerance limit so that it can increase the activity time efficiency.",10.1109/ICEEI47359.2019.8988882,A.

The heterogeneity and high-mobility in smart city systems have arisen the need for the mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) emerges as an efficient routing protocol in MANET is based on the less overhead by reducing message exchange with limited information. However, this creates a weakness as nodes have limited knowledge about other nodes' identity inside the path beyond the neighboring node (node in transmission range). That prevents the participant from authenticating others and has limited capability to check the integrity of the exchanged information. To accomplish this, it requires a further exchange of messages that defeat the AODV main principle and causes extra overhead that drains the portable devices' limited battery energy inside the network. This paper used the blockchain concept to generate a hashed identifier from the node's IP and passed between nodes inside the path during the route discovery that provides assurance about the identity of the node and keeps the integrity of the exchanged information. Additionally, Simulation results using (Riverbed/Opnet) of the attack scenario show that the proposed algorithm prevents impersonation and black-hole attacks by eliminating the path that involves malicious nodes with a (4 millisecond) increase in route discovery time.",10.1109/BCCA50787.2020.9274452,A.

Practical Vulnerabilities in Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Blockchain Consensus Protocols,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5062712882511811,"Blockchain technology has gained widespread use across various industries, including finance and medicine. Private blockchains, particularly those utilizing Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols, are in high demand by both commercial organizations and governments. This article examines the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on BFT protocols by consensus participants. While BFT protocols can theoretically tolerate up to one third adversaries in a partial synchronous setting, their practical implementations rely on hidden assumptions of instant message processing time and infinite available memory to store a message queue. These assumptions can become vulnerabilities when a malicious node floods consensus messages. In this paper, we propose a protocol for conducting a Byzantine node DoS attack (BDoS) and demonstrate its feasibility for a popular blockchain framework.

It is a collection of facts and statistic together used for data analysis, mining etc. Data is additionally used as input for numerous computing algorithms to mine out necessary features. Since information is spread all over the web, it rises a lot of trust issues between various organizations. This questions the security of the data on the web and it’s hard to create a cyberspace for this huge amount of data. Providing data security is extremely important in day to day life because there exists a lot of sensitive information, in case it falls into the wrong hands it can cause a lot of problems. Data security is of utmost importance in almost every field like army, hospitals, government offices, colleges, schools etc. In simple words, the process of protecting data from unauthorized access and data corruption is termed as data security. In order to achieve this security, key management, data encryption, hashing and tokenization techniques can be used. Data plays a huge role in any business so it is important to protect your data with the increase in rate of data breach happening. Data security follows the CIA principle. Confidentiality only provides access to authorized users. This can be achieved by implementing access control lists, encryption, strong passwords and two factor authentication. Integrity implies the protection of data from any sort of unauthorized modifications that can disrupt the original data. Digital security can be used to implement integrity. Availability completely focuses on ensuring that all the software and security controls work properly without any interruption. Since the blockchain is a secure chain of individual blocks of transactions there cannot be a chance of hacking or modification of the blocks after it is registered once.

Toward Secure and Transparent Global Authentication: A Blockchain-Based System Integrating Biometrics and Subscriber Identification Module,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8273163591146016,"The growing reliance on e-government services necessitates robust and secure user authentication. Existing solutions often suffer from limitations such as lack of transparency, compromise of user privacy, and reliance on a central server, thus introducing a single point of failure (SPOF). This paper proposes B2-GAS, a novel Biometric and Blockchain-based Global Authentication System, that addresses these shortcomings. B2-GAS leverages user biometrics on smartphones for strong identification and isolates sensitive cryptographic operations within a secure enclave on a SIM card. This approach safeguards user privacy and data security. By employing blockchain technology, B2-GAS eliminates SPOFs, ensures tamper-proof transaction storage, and guarantees transparency. Unlike existing protocols, which often rely on theoretical analysis, B2-GAS utilizes an emulated environment to assess its performance under realistic conditions. This allows for a more practical evaluation compared to purely theoretical approaches. B2-GAS exerts multiple factors during authentication including biometrics, a password, and a secret parameter to further enhance security. Rigorous security proofs demonstrate B2-GAS’s resistance to user impersonation, offline password-guessing, replay attacks, and brute-force attempts. Evaluation using the emulated environment and blockchain simulations demonstrates B2-GAS security parameters, performance, and computational overheads. By combining biometrics, secure SIM enclaves, and blockchain, B2-GAS offers a unique and robust authentication solution for diverse e-government services in smart cities.",10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3550302,N.

Blockchain Guided Trustworthy Interactions for Distributed Disaster Management,2019,-1,Outliers,0.04116063115950961,"Given the devastating outcomes of the recent hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods across the globe, governments all over the world started to pay serious attention to their disaster management protocols. The current reliance on centralized, infrastructure-dependent solutions is a serious threat to the whole management process. The entire process is mainly about processing help requests based on real-time information about the disaster, and efficiently responding to such requests by dispensing a set of limited resources available at the management's disposal. Relying on independent anonymous help givers can expand the resource availability and facilitate help provisioning. Further, Crowdsourcing can be a valuable source of information that can better guide help provisioning process. However, establishing dynamic trust relationship between help requesters, information providers, and help givers is the key enabler to such enhancement. Help requests should be probably authenticated not to waste the valuable resources, help provisioning should be rewarded to motivate help givers, and Data sharing should be verified not to act on false information. In this paper, we present a decentralized Blockchain based trust management framework to facilitate cooperative anonymous help provisioning at disaster time considering infrastructure-supported scenario.",10.1109/IEMCON.2019.8936147,E.

Drivers and Impediments: Experts Opinions on Blockchain Adoption in the Netherlands,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"There is an ongoing interest in blockchain by organisations and governments in the Netherlands. In this research we aim to determine what positive and negative factors influence blockchain adoption in the Netherlands. We achieve this by interviewing eight blockchain experts and by analysing the factors that are top of mind among these experts. We anticipated that the majority of the experts would mention the technological advantages of blockchain as a prevalent factor that drives adoption. Surprisingly, our research suggests a disconnect between blockchain adoption and its technological advantages. By contrast, a prevalent factor that drives blockchain adoption is competitive pressure, according to the majority of experts. Also, based on the analysis of the interviews we introduce two new drivers, 1. Being willing to collaborate, and 2. Problem match. We also identify two factors that are an impediment for blockchain adoption according to the majority of the experts, 1. Lack of regulation on blockchain, and 2. Lack of knowledge about blockchain properties by non-experts. Our work is useful as organisations and governments may want to reconsider their rationale for adopting blockchain. If a rationale exists for adopting blockchain then these organisations and governments can focus on the impediments of blockchain adoption.",10.1109/BCCA50787.2020.9274086,M. Vergouwen; T. Koens; E.

However, larger data volumes, draw together a series of drawbacks that affect data quality and integrity and this becomes more evident in government supervised industrial settings. In many of such cases, public authorities have defined sets of principles (e.g., ALCOA+) regarding data management that industrial organizations must abide to, and either deliberate or not violation of these standards most often comes with severe legal consequences. As a matter of fact, in an effort to follow as much as humanly possible to such principles, pharmaceuticals industries invest heavily in resources to maintain high quality standards in their data urging for automated methods for calculating, monitoring and predicting compliance.Also, in complex manufacturing and production lines, data analytics provide means for real-time and continuous monitoring of large numbers of sensor variables and categorical or numerical values where higher order conclusions can be derived and taken into account when business process optimizations are considered. In this work we present an easy-to-use integrated platform for real-time raw sensor data monitoring and pre-processing in pharmaceuticals production lines combining blockchain storage for data integrity and deep-learning capabilities for data analytics.

A Blockchain Solution for Enhancing Risk Management and Transparency in Loan Disbursements,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.832366729549275,"The Loan Market holds substantial importance within the field of global finance. The issue of financial fraud in loan disbursements has become a major concern. The potential for fraudulent activities can be worsened by specific practices employed by borrowers, such as the submission of identical collateral to multiple financial institutions. Additionally, inadequate assessment of collateral by banks and the granting of loans solely based on the borrower’s reputation can further contribute to the elevated risk of fraud. The banking sector lacks transparency and internal control mechanisms, within themselves. The present study presents a novel Blockchain framework that utilizes Multi-Signature smart contracts which aims to improve transparency, mitigate the risk of fraud during loan disbursement, and establish a synchronized record-keeping process for loans. Financial institutions must create multi-signature contracts for individual borrowers if the loan amount exceeds a certain threshold. Borrowers must wait for bank confirmation before disbursing loans. Confirmation is determined by the bank representative through evaluation of RMS (Risk Management Score) which is calculated by various methods as further discussed in this study. Proposed work enables synchronized and efficient record-keeping of loans across multiple banks and creates a consolidated loan registry that helps government regulatory bodies monitor and supervise loans, increasing compliance with regulations.",10.1109/EASCT59475.2023.10392836,N.

Blockchain-based Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading through a Community-based Virtual Power Plant,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Developing countries are faced with constant power shortages, which hinders economic growth. The use of fossil fuels has also contributed to this challenge, but now governments have been trying to encourage people to adopt renewable energy at an individual level. This is seen as a long-term solution to the current power challenges. The adoption and use of renewable energy, however, has its own challenges, such as intermittent availability and the high start-up costs. This paper proposes a communitybased virtual power plant (CVPP) with a peer-to-peer energy trading platform as a solution to some of these challenges. CVPPs are decentralized energy systems within a small geographic area that connect small-scale energy producers. The resources of these producers are then pooled together to create a single energy ecosystem. The addition of peer-to-peer energy trading to this setup adds an economic incentive to the members of the CVPP as it allows them to sell excess energy to their neighbours. Blockchain technology acts as a medium of trust in the absence of a trusted third-party. A small-scale prototype for this system was built and tested.

Design of an Improved Model for Authentication Using Blockchain and Zero-Knowledge Proofs,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7816446742749668,"In the graph of an increasingly interconnected and data-driven world, strong, secure, and privacypreserving authentication systems come as cardinal. Traditional methods of authentication have rarely met the requirements in terms of security, scalability, and privacy of the user. The present models are prone to data breaches, unauthorized access, and opacity in authentication transactions. In this paper, we propose the BlockchainEnhanced Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication model, where current blockchain technology is combined with state-of-the-art zero-knowledge proof protocols to improve security, privacy, and transparency. To this end, the BZKPA framework uses ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs for performing private identity verification without the disclosure of sensitive sets of information. The aforesaid protocols guarantee compact, efficient, and scalable proof generation and verification processes. The model makes use of blockchain's distributed ledger technology to form an immutable and tamper-proof record for the purpose of tracing and integrity in authentication transactions. Inherent consensus mechanisms within blockchain enhance the security resilience of BZKPA against unauthorized access and cyber attacks. On the other hand, the workflow of BZKPA involves user registration and initialization of credentials, initiation of an authentication request, generation of zero-knowledge proof, verification of proof, and blockchain recording of valid authentication transactions. It means secure and privacy-preserving authentication, with transparency and auditability enabled by blockchain technology. Critical considerations addressed in the implementation of BZKPA shall be related to cryptographic security, blockchain platform selection, smart contract development, compliance with privacy and data protection, scalability, and interoperability. Applications of BZKPA range from financial services to healthcare, government, supply chain, and IoT, and even decentralized applications, providing enhanced security and privacy for a digital identity verification process. The model proposed by BZKPA offers several improvements in the authentication system, covering the famous limitations and lacunas of the previous methods and developing a strong solution for secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving authentication. Its adoption can be a new bar of digital identity verification, strengthen the defense of cybersecurity, and further empower users over their digital identities against varied contexts.",10.1109/ICETETSIP64213.2025.11156282,R.

Generalized Immutable Ledger (GILED) using Blockchain Technology,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7544664650283189,"Applications of centralised databases have been found in many areas. Almost every organization, private or public, makes use of centralised databases. These databases hold the entire scenario about the organization, like records of their customers, transactions occurring in the organization, past analysis, current performance, future prediction, and a lot more things that can be calculated over them. Basically, these databases are the roots of a particular organization. But the issue regarding these centralised databases is that their access is totally open to some individuals or a particular group of people within the organization. The issue that has been identified is corruption. It is difficult for an outsider to manipulate the data, but it is very simple for anyone within the organisation to do so. Now here the owner of the organization, whether an individual or the government, and the customers of the organisation face trouble because these manipulations are done in such a fine manner that only the person manipulating them knows the changes, while the owner and the customer are unaware of them. These things are more likely to be seen in government sectors. So in order to overcome the existing problem, we are considering using block chain technology in our project. Since the block chain is a distributed network, manipulation of the data is impossible by a single corrupt person. Each minute change made in a ledger can be tracked using a block chain. Many applications have already been deployed to address this issue, but this paper is about generalization, which will be based on a multi-purpose use case rather than a specific use case. This paper gives a generalised solution to solve the above-mentioned problem in any field or use case.",10.1109/SCEECS57921.2023.10062983,H. Bari; N. Patel
Blockchain - Bringing Accountability in the Public Distribution System,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8507680643665119,"The Central and State governments of India uses the Public Distribution System(PDS) to distribute food grains to the citizen of India at subsidized rates to ensure food security. The system is prone to losses of food grains because of prevalent corruption among the officials serving the system and also due to physical losses during storage and transport. Blockchains have become a commonly used audit trail verification utility because of its inherent nature, that it is a distributed ledger for recording transactions. This makes it a key candidate to replace the current centralized system that exists for the tracking of commodities being distributed by the PDS. Like any centralized system the current centralized system can be sabotaged by the people in administration, as it relies heavily on trust on the central authority. In this paper we propose an intelligent scheme for tracking the commodities in PDS using IoT based sensors that monitor the arrival and dispatch of commodities and generate corresponding transactions. These transactions should be stored permanently to keep track of the commodities for which a decentralized Blockchain based system is used that continuously logs every valid transaction. As the amount of transactions increase so does the data to be stored on the blockchain, hence we propose a hierarchical blockchain approach where in transaction summaries of a local blockchain are recorded as transactions in a higher level blockchain after which the local blockchains can start afresh recording newer transactions only. This approach results in reduction in the amount of data to be stored on the blockchain. At the same time one can find aggregate information at a higher level which can be used to determine the supply demand ratio. Anyone can verify the current availability of the food grains throughout the distribution network of the PDS and track the commodities right from the network of warehouses to the end point sales-the fair price shops where the food grains are delivered to the consumers. These transactions can be audited at any time as all transactions are recorded in the Blockchain which can prevent any misuse or corruption.",10.1109/RTEICT46194.2019.9016903,A. N. Shwetha; C. P.

Blockchain Simulators: A Systematic Mapping Study,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9125093373634329,"Recently, distributed ledger technologies like blockchain have been proliferating and have attracted interest from the academic community, government, and industry. A wide range of blockchain solutions has been introduced, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger technologies in the literature. However, tools for evaluating these solutions and their applications are still lacking, limiting the exploration of their potentiality and associated challenges/limitations. That is, experimenting with real blockchain networks usually requires a solid budget; and thus, sophisticated blockchain simulators can facilitate designing and evaluating solutions before the actual implementation stage. The quality of such simulators depends on several factors such as usability, reliability, provided capabilities, and supported features. This paper aims to provide a systemic mapping review of blockchain simulators focusing on these quality factors. This paper also sheds light on the configuration parameters (inputs) and produced metrics (outputs) supported by each simulator. Furthermore, it investigates which metrics supported by each simulator are scientifically validated/evaluated. Moreover, code quality comparison is carried out to assess the source code of the covered simulators. The results reveal that no simulator fully covers the wide operational range of features and capabilities of existing blockchain technologies.

Looking at all modern technologies that seem to move towards decentralized architecture, blockchain and distributed ledger technology fit perfectly. In times of conventional database-orientated systems, modern frameworks made huge developments when application programming interfaces (APIs) and data were used cross-platform between centralized entities. A natural evolution for blockchain technology would be to enable communication and data exchange between blockchains (ie. both private and public). This could help not only digitize but could also set in a revolution for digital record-keeping that can be used for automation in the future.

Fair and Transparent Blockchain Based Tendering Framework - A Step Towards Open Governance,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8609934150845779,"At a time when society is in constant transition to keep up with technological advancement, we are seeing traditional paradigms being increasingly challenged. The fundamentals of governance are one such paradigm. As society's values have shifted, so have expectations of government shifted from the traditional model to something commonly referred to as `open governance'. Though a disputed term, we take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates openness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of open governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet, that are crucial. These technologies enable access to both the data and to engagement activities between citizens and government. There are also other technologies, like blockchain and smart contacts, which could be utilised to assist open governance. A sound starting point would be moving from a system where information is tediously released by a government, on an `as they please' basis, to an infrastructure where critical actions are captured with strong integrity, non-repudiation and evidential guarantees. With an added dimension that facilitates these actions record be accessible to public scrutiny in near real-time. One candidate technology for capturing such actions is blockchain. Initially, blockchains were mainly used to facilitate cryptocurrencies as a record of transactions. The notable example being bitcoin. However, in recent years, blockchains utility is being recognised through smart contracts - potentially a vital building block to realising open and transparent government activities. In this paper, we employ the concept of smart contracts to government tendering activities. The proposed scheme is based on smart contracts, enabling a fair, transparent and independently verifiable (auditable) government tendering scheme. The scheme is then implemented on the Ethereum platform to evaluate the performance and financial cost implications, along with an evaluation of the potential security and auditability challenges.",10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00185,F.

LTSM: Lightweight and Trusted Sharing Mechanism of IoT Data in Smart City,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.963266183500084,"With the development of smart cities, the chimney construction method can no longer meet service needs. It is extremely urgent to build a unified urban brain, and the core issue is data sharing and fusion. Aiming at the problems of data island, data leakage, and high trust cost in the IoT of the smart city, a lightweight and trusted sharing mechanism (LTSM) is proposed. First, the blockchain is combined with federated learning to realize the data sharing, which not only protects the private data, but also ensures the sharing process trust. Then, a node selection algorithm based on credit value and a node evaluation algorithm based on smart contract are designed to improve the quality of federated learning. Finally, we propose an improved raft consensus to meet the delay and security requirements of the consortium blockchain in the smart city scenario. In the simulation, we evaluate the federated learning algorithm, the node selection algorithm, and the improved raft consensus, respectively. The experimental results show that the LTSM mechanism has a good application value. The federated learning model has a better accuracy, but its training time is also longer. The node selection algorithm is helpful to improve the accuracy of the federated learning model. The improved raft consensus improves the throughput.",10.1109/JIOT.2021.3110097,C. Liu; S. Guo; S.

Self-organization of Network Communities via Blockchain Technology: Reputation Systems and Limits of Digital Democracy,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6606687517941658,"The article is devoted to the analysis of the use of blockchain technology for self-organization of network communities. Network communities are characterized by the key role of trust in personal interactions, the need for repeated interactions, strong and weak ties within the network, social learning as the mechanism of self-organization. Therefore, in network communities reputation is the central component of social action, assessment of the situation, and formation of the expectations. The current proliferation of virtual network communities requires the development of appropriate technical infrastructure in the form of reputation systems - programs that provide calculation of network members reputation and organization of their cooperation and interaction. Traditional reputation systems have vulnerabilities in the field of information security and prevention of abusive behavior of agents. Overcoming these restrictions is possible through integration of reputation systems and blockchain technology that allows to increase transparency of reputation assessment system and prevent attempts of manipulation the system and social engineering. At the same time, the most promising is the use of blockchain-oracles to ensure communication between the algorithms of blockchain-based reputation system and the external information environment. The popularization of blockchain technology and its implementation in various spheres of social management, production control, economic exchange actualizes the problems of using digital technologies in political processes and their impact on the formation of digital authoritarianism, digital democracy and digital anarchism. The paper emphasizes that blockchain technology and reputation systems can equally benefit both the resources of government control and tools of democratization and public accountability to civil society or even practices of avoiding government.

A Permissioned Distributed Ledger for Monitoring Web Content,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8366056082979998,"Online publishing of news and information enables important content to reach a much larger audience than traditional paper publishing, but there is no guarantee of long-term, reliable, and persistent access to the content. Over time, links ""decay"" because they are not reliably updated when content changes location, or even worse, content is deliberately altered from its original published form or deleted altogether. We present the design of Watchdog, a permissioned distributed ledger that securely and reliably monitors and preserves dynamic web content such as government and news sites. Unlike prior preservation systems, our system design allows nodes to be dispersed across multiple administrative domains, thus eliminating single points of trust and at the same time, is the first to monitor how content changes both over time and across geographical location. Watchdog achieves Byzantine fault-tolerance via a novel interactive consistency algorithm that offers a twist on the traditional definition and use of interactive consistency; the algorithm enables a set of mutually suspicious nodes, with arbitrary-sized, potentially overlapping data collections, to efficiently agree on the exact data collection in possession by each node. We demonstrate how our algorithm enables Watchdog nodes to exchange and agree upon the content each has observed individually, in a fault-tolerant, tamper-proof manner.",10.1109/ICPADS47876.2019.00062,M.

It is imperative to ensure the security of this technology and to understand the potential associated risks. However, in the recent past, blockchain-based applications have suffered from series of security breaches ranging from fraud to smart contract vulnerabilities, wallet theft, private key compromise, and non-regulatory compliance. One of the best ways to identify security threats and the associated risks in blockchain applications is to undertake a proper risk assessment. This paper presents a systematic review of the risk assessment frameworks in blockchain-based applications. We first review the general overview of blockchain technology and examine the up-to-date concepts of blockchain risk management, focusing on risk assessment. Although many scholars have worked on blockchain applications and have published surveys on challenges and opportunities, some on security threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks of blockchain technology, very few have researched blockchain risk management and assessment, and none has proposed a framework for assessing risk in blockchain-based applications. Following our proposed survey methodology, the key contributions of this literature review include a comprehensive assessment of various blockchain applications and their adoption challenges, risks in centralised versus decentralised systems, risk assessment and management in blockchain technologies, and three case studies on the risks of blockchain applications and their real-world implications.

Randomly Elected Blockchain System based on Grouping Verifiers for Efficiency and Security,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5510409917710188,"Many systems have been built for transactions without a central manager by introducing blockchain in various fields such as industry, public sector, and trading economy. The blockchain system is also contributing to the advancement of technology to enable reliable transactions in distributed networks like P2P or D2D. Consensus algorithm for each operating environment is used to verify whether a transaction is valid. Transactions are verified generally with Proof-of-work (PoW) in public blockchain and Practice Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) in private blockchain. The PBFT is only available to a group of limited participants and is used for small groups. However, these small groups can be compromised by the collusion of malicious users, making it impossible to trade or forge. In addition, the blockchain does not define any security structure on users, devices, transaction history accessibility, etc., which causes issues with system permission. Therefore, this paper analyzes the problem of the conventional blockchain in terms of participant-collusion, authentication, and confidentiality, and proposes a Randomly Elected Blockchain (REBC) to solve each problem. In the first participant-collusion, the private blockchain enables the system to operate without any cost for verification. Thereby solving the problem of grouping nodes for malicious collusion, the proposed mechanism is to randomly elect the nodes in the unit group, and then conduct consensus algorithms. Besides, many participants are able to participate in the consensus experiment without degraded performance. In the second problem, a smart manager system provides authentication of users and devices. The solution to the third problem related to confidentiality is to analyze the current RSA encryption method and supplement it with a proxy re-encryption method.",10.23919/ICACT48636.2020.9061277,D.

To address these problems. We propose an accountable CP-ABE mechanism based on block chain system. First, we establish two authorization agencies MskCA and AttrVN(Attribute verify Network),where the MskCA can realize master key escrow, and the AttrVN manages and validates users' attributes. In this way, our system can avoid the single point of failure and improve the privacy of user attributes and security of keys. Moreover, in order to realize auditability of CP-ABE key parameter transfer, we introduce the did and record parameter transfer process on the block chain. Finally, we theoretically prove the security of our CP-ABE. Through comprehensive comparison, the superiority of CP-ABE is verified.

Advanced E-Voting System using Blockchain,2022,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,0.8131472457526654,"Voting is a crucial part of the process of selection of a government. Multiple layers of encryption and authentication must secure this voting process (more like a financial transaction). During achieving this security transaction, it may fail to uphold its atomic nature. As a result of this incomplete transaction, the voting credit may be disowned, and the vote may not to be cast. Even though the voter can revert credits through manual verification (like in online money transfer), the operation’s scale makes it an unrealistic task to perform. Applying a smart contract in the block chain ledger can be executed when the transaction has been completed and the vote has been cast. Moreover, the voting credit won’t be withdrawn unless the vote for the respective id has been performed.

Online Voting Application Using Ethereum Blockchain,2018,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,0.9649332241843853,"Voting is an important part of the administration of a country. Votes are still being carried out by physically going to voting booths. This process doesn't guarantee security and cases of tampering has been observed. This paper aims at removing these issues in the voting process by making it online and using the technology, Blockchain. Blockchain uses encryption and hashing to make every vote secure. In this case, one vote is considered as a transaction. A peer to peer network is created to create a private blockchain that share this distributed ledger having voting transaction. The application is designed in such a way so that the intricacies of the underlying architecture is hidden from the user. Each voter is uniquely identified by Government approved Aadhar number. The application makes use of this number to make sure that each voter gets only one chance to vote. When the vote gets submitted as a transaction then all the peers get synch up. Since each peer is associated with a public and private key the votes are encrypted and hashed and added to the blockchain to increase security and form a chain of blocks. Votes cannot be tracked back to the voter. In this paper, a peer to peer network is created having minimum three peers. Since voting is made online, it is expected that this paper will increase the voter turnouts.

The problem of security and privacy in the blockchain ecosystem, which is now a hot topic in the blockchain community, is discussed in this study. The survey’s goal was to investigate this issue by considering several sorts of assaults on the blockchain network in relation to the algorithms offered. Following a preliminary literature assessment, it appears that some attention has been paid to the first use case; however the second use case, to the best of my knowledge, deserves more attention when blockchain is used to investigate it. However, due to the subsequent government mandated secrecy around the implementation of DES, and the distrust of the academic community because of this, a movement was spawned that put a premium on individual privacy and decentralized control. This movement brought together the top minds in encryption and spawned the technology we know of as blockchain today. This survey paper also explores the genesis of encryption, its early adoption, and the government meddling which eventually spawned a movement which gave birth to the ideas behind blockchain.

Efficient Authentication System Based On Blockchain Using eID card,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8861488018286053,"With the continuous advancement of smart cities, Internet of Things(IoT) technology is flourishing at an unprecedented rate. This has led to a rapid increase in the number of IoT devices and a consequent rise in data interactions between these devices. As a result, the management and verification of device identities have become increasingly crucial. However, current systems still rely on vast databases to store identity data and require manual intervention for authentication. This reliance on databases limits the efficiency of authentication, particularly in environments with a large number of devices. To address this challenge, we have integrated government public key infrastructure(PKI) with smart contract technology to develop an efficient and automated authentication system. Our system utilizes electronic identity cards(eID cards) as a storage medium for certificates, providing reliable identity proof. Smart contracts are then used to automatically verify the certificates and implement access control over the verification results. Our system offers not only stronger universality, reduced storage overhead, and faster authentication speed, but also higher scalability.

Securing a National Driver and Vehicle Registration System with Blockchain,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8500334466122764,"Countries have laws and policies around motor vehicles in order to shield citizens from harm, protect important infrastructure and preserve the environment. However, enforcing those laws is difficult because of the scale of such a task as well as the presence of corruption and forged documents. One of the key ways governments have tackled this issue is by creating driver and vehicle registration systems where information is collected and accessed by relevant participants such as police, vehicle insurers, and government agencies. These systems often use centralized architectures that rely on a single party. Because this approach has limited transparency it can undermine the trust in the system. This is the case of Colombia. A country with a system that handles about 1.5 million procedures every month and is classified as critical national infrastructure. This system is nearing its end of life and the requirements for its replacement have been made public. According to these, the new system will use blockchain, a technology that can decentralize responsibility between several actors thus removing single points of failure, increasing transparency and trust. This would make it one of the first blockchain solutions in Colombia in the public sector, and globally one of the first uses of blockchain by a transit organization.

In this paper, we will look at how Blockchain can be used to secure digital identity which is a trustworthy idea that describes how people can use or what type of attribute or parameter can be used to identify someone's identity. The identity is used for different kind of application which is typically decentralized and any or-ganization can take control over the identity data which reasons a large number of identity fraud. The idea is to build a single multipurpose identity that will be secured using Blockchain technology. Instead of several identification documents, Users can use this single multipurpose identity to prove their identity in various sectors such as the government and other private sectors to access particular services. Automated and real-time identity verification through smart contracts can verify the identity data. The Blockchain will provide a tamper-proof method of storing documents or data that can be audited by the government and ensures the User's transparency through Blockchain by showing the record of activity.",10.1109/CCWC54503.2022.9720808,A.

DBE-voting: A Privacy-Preserving and Auditable Blockchain-Based E-Voting System,2023,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,0.6934440332476421,"Blockchain technology can construct a distributed and trusted ledger, which can be used for electronic voting (E-voting) systems to ensure the security of voting data and improve government credibility. However, existing blockchain-based solutions cannot fully fulfill five core requirements in E-voting, i.e., auditability, privacy, authentication, correctness, and unreusability, which make them unpractical in the reality. In this paper, we propose a Double Blockchain-based E-voting (DBE-voting) system, which consists of a private blockchain and a public blockchain. In the proposed system, the voter information is only recorded in the private blockchain for further auditing and the voting results are recorded in both blockchains. The voter's privacy can be protected in the private blockchain while the voting results can be queried in the public blockchain for verifying the correctness of the election process. Moreover, the ballot recorded in both blockchains is signed with a valid linkable ring signature to ensure authentication and unreusability. We propose an on-chain and off-chain hybrid storage mechanism to ensure the consistency and correctness of voting data in two blockchains. Experimental results demonstrate that the throughput of our system can reach 29 transactions per second when the block size is 512 KB. The security analysis shows that the DBE-voting is the first blockchain-based system that can meet all five requirements simultaneously.",10.1109/ICC45041.2023.10279692,Z. Liu; X. Zhang; L. Lao; G.

Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain-Based Trading Framework for Satellite Images,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9404341009851385,"The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the space industry is a crucial step towards advancing humanity. It has the potential to create innovative technologies and services, revolutionize existing practices, and provide valuable insights to space researchers. Many private investors and government organizations possess high demand for satellite images for various reasons, including weather forecasting, global disaster management (e.g., floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis), space object location, land records, geolocations, and international shipment management. However, the traditional centralized economic model for space business is costly to implement in terms of infrastructure, deployment, security risks, ownership, and marketing of the data. Additionally, the initial acquisition of satellite images is usually retrieved in a raw format without any authentication or interpretation. Consequently, the integration of AI and the space industry has the potential to revolutionize the existing model by unlocking new avenues to monetize satellite data by introducing automated processes that are more secure and cost-effective. In this paper, we aim to use deep learning models that are capable of automatically analyzing and classifying raw satellite images into valuable and actionable formats. Furthermore, we are inspired to design a blockchain-based solution to make satellite image datasets available to private and government agencies through a user-friendly and secure marketplace. The proposed solution will focus on a decentralized socio-economic model using blockchain to increase the security of transactions. Blockchain networks facilitate the fair exchange of transactions using smart contracts that will execute and enforce agreement rules among the blockchain participants. The proposed research will mainly focus on the efficient design of smart contracts for satellite data blockchain.

A Blockchain-Based Crowdsourcing Loan Platform for Funding Higher Education in Developing Countries,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7138068079294402,"In developing countries, funding is a significant obstacle to receiving higher education. Brilliant but needy students cannot complete their studies since their parents are unemployed and their countries’ economies are poor. As a result, the students’ talents are not harnessed to their full potential. In order to help students obtain higher education and harness their full potential, governments provide student loans to students in higher education. The government provides loans to students through the ministry of education. The students pay back the loan with interest when they start working. Governments have been the sole funders of student loans. The emergence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war have resulted in a global economic crisis. Because of the global economic crisis, the government’s spending has increased. In order to help reduce the burden of government and thereby reduce spending, we intend to revolutionize the student loan program through blockchain and crowdsourcing.

A Scalable Blockchain Consensus Model,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.47875312748339116,"Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledger supporting strong secure transactions across various nodes in a Blockchain network after the mutual consensus of all the nodes in the associated network. Blockchain technology is the foundation technology of various crypto currencies. However, it has the potential to contribute to several mission-critical applications (MCA) or real-time applications such as Healthcare, e-Voting, Government Regulatory to securely regulate business processes or to identify any fictitious business transaction. Unfortunately, Blockchain implementations in MCAs are still being challenged by rigorous requirements. The most pressing among these challenges is scalability. The performance time in the current consensus model (related to scalability) is still questionable, especially in MCAs. That is, the model is lacking in high efficiency in many aspects such as transaction throughput, transaction latency, network bandwidth, and storage, despite strong reliability (in terms of advanced security and privacy) through an immutable shared distributed ledger. Hence, there is an exigent need for a new consensus model which could mitigate the scalability issues in MCAs.

It is often complex due to the rapid development of economic globalization and the intense competition pressure in the market which resulted in information sharing within a supply chain to be fragmented. Blockchain technology can solve this problem by having only a “one trusted ledger” that could reshape the element of data trust. The goal of this paper is to identify and understand the impact of blockchain technology for information sharing within a supply chain. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology offers a high level of transparency and has gained the attention from various sectors to deploy this technology. A systematic literature review in the academic literature was conducted using different databases. Blockchain-enabled information sharing can add value to enhance collaborative work in different types of supply chains such as health and medical, construction and smart city.

Attribute-based Encryption on Ethereum for Smart City Access Control,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6195086453925289,"Smart city infrastructures are resulting in a concern regarding proper security and fine- grained access control for the access of the sensitive data generated by the interconnected devices and services. Having rich yet heterogeneous environments is a common scenario for organizations nowadays, and conventional access control mechanisms often do not suffice to provide support for flexible, scalable and decentralized authorization. Here, we develop a new access control method that leverages Cipher text-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) and Ethereum smart contracts to realize decentralized and fine-grained data access in smart city applications. Users are allowed to access and decrypt information only if they own a suitable set of attribute. They leverage smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to perform attribute verification, issue keys, and log access actions, which removes the need to trust a centralized authority. We also describe the architecture of the system, the design of smart contracts, and an implementation prototype. The experimental results can validate the computational efficiency, the gas consumption and the policy expressiveness of our approach, showing that it is a promising solution for secure and transparent data access control model in smart cities.",10.1109/ICICV64824.2025.11085776,S.

Combating Deceptive Counterfeits With Blockchain Technology Under Asymmetric Information,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9835881488014275,"Blockchain technology has recently been regarded as a promising anti-counterfeiting strategy. This article explores whether the retailer concerned with goodwill should adopt blockchain to combat counterfeits and disclose demand on the blockchain when both demand information and the supplier's product quality information are asymmetric. We also extend the model by considering the supplier's willingness to join the blockchain, endogenous authenticity proportion, and multiple suppliers. The main results show that when goodwill loss is high, the retailer always prefers blockchain; when this loss is medium, the retailer prefers blockchain only if both the unit production cost and proportion of authentic products are low. In some cases, the retailer has an incentive to disclose demand on the blockchain to motivate the supplier to join the blockchain, thereby achieving a win–win situation. The optimal government subsidy that both incentivizes the retailer to adopt blockchain and improves the supplier's preference for blockchain is also explored.",10.1109/TEM.2022.3223899,J. Wang; Q.

However, SMEs experience many obstacles in developing their businesses, and one of the problems is financial limitations. Several efforts have been made to strengthen SMEs' finances, but financial assistance cannot help SMEs develop their businesses. The cause is weak supervision over the use of funds originating from government assistance or other institutions, so that these funds are not used effectively to develop SME businesses. Thus, the aim of this research is to increase transparency in the monitoring of MSME financial assistance using blockchain technology. The adoption of blockchain technology for MSME financial assistance involves creating a consensus about the source and use of financial assistance stored in smart contracts. All stakeholders must be registered as blocks that will join the blockchain network. The research uses a qualitative approach through a literature review to analyse phenomena and identify problems with financial assistance for MSMEs. The result of this research is a model for adopting blockchain technology to increase transparency in the use of financial assistance for SMEs.

A distributed model for sharing tendering project information in the South African Local Government,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8790185820633664,"The South African Local Government uses the tendering system to deliver some of the basic services to the surrounding communities to promote social and industrial or environmental policies. However, this process still relies heavily on a manual process, which requires skilled personnel to deal with the forms and administrations of the entire tendering process. Some of the project information shared by the supplier during the tender bidding process plays a critical role when it comes to awarding a tender project to a particular supplier since it reflects the competency area and project history. Some of the tools used to share this project information are reports, meetings, presentations, and site visits. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed model that might be used to share tendering project information securely and efficiently with all the parties that have an interest in the tendering project. The proposed model seeks to promote the need for sharing project information while eliminating issues that are related to a single point of failure or having an organisation that has central powers over project information. Additionally, the proposed model can also be used to foster collaboration between the public and private sectors by becoming an essential tool that might be used to securely share project information without colluding. The proposed model also incorporates the benefits and promises that come with the adoption of distributed ledger technology (blockchain) as a technology solution.",10.1109/CW55638.2022.00055,P. T.

Sustainable Waste Management using Block Chain Techniques for Smart City,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7949064263493795,"Environmental sustainability is a paramount concern in the management of waste which requires a unique innovative solution. The global waste and resource crises necessitate and give great impetus for better and more sustainable management of waste. Increasingly, resource and waste streams that once were sent to landfill or incinerated are now reused, recycled, or recovered. Smart cities can prevent environmental issues brought on by inappropriate garbage disposal by lowering air pollution, safeguarding the aquatic ecology, and enhancing public health and secure data standards promises numerous benefits. This approach provides the suitability of blockchain technology in overcoming waste management problems. E-waste is the word used to describe these Electronic and Electrical Equipment (EEE) that consumers abandon. E-waste management involves collecting, sorting, and recycling old electronics in an environmentally responsible way. The unorganized sector still controls a substantial portion of India’s e-waste collection and recycling industry, which makes it exceedingly challenging to implement such rules. In response to these challenges, an approach with blockchain technology and secure data standards has been developed to revolutionize the waste management method. A blockchain model is essential for waste management due to its ability to provide transparency, traceability, and decentralization. In traditional waste management systems, tracking the lifecycle of waste is often challenging, leading to inefficiencies and difficulties in monitoring its movement. Blockchain technology solves this problem by creating a transparent and immutable ledger, where every step in the waste management process is recorded. Moreover, by integrating secure data standards into the system, the proposed approach ensures that sensitive waste-related information is protected from unauthorized access and tampering using the DES (Data Encryption Standard Algorithm) and blockchain technology.",10.1109/ICIMIA60377.2023.10426053,R.

Effective Identity Authentication Based on Multiattribute Centers for Secure Government Data Sharing,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6523584264385899,"As one of the essential steps to secure government data sharing, Identity Authentication (IA) plays a vital role in the processing of large data. However, the centralized IA scheme based on a trusted third party presents problems of information leakage and single point of failure, and those related to key escrow. Therefore, herein, an effective IA model based on multiattribute centers is designed. First, a private key of each attribute of a data requester is generated by the attribute authorization center. After obtaining the private key of attribute, the data requester generates a personal private key. Second, a dynamic key generation algorithm is proposed, which combines blockchain and smart contracts to periodically update the key of a data requester to prevent theft by external attackers, ensure the traceability of IA, and reduce the risk of privacy leakage. Third, the combination of blockchain and interplanetary file systems is used to store attribute field information of the data requester to further reduce the cost of blockchain information storage and improve the effectiveness of information storage. Experimental results show that the proposed model ensures the privacy and security of identity information and outperforms similar authentication models in terms of computational and communication costs.",10.26599/TST.2023.9010049,M.

Can Blockchain Spark off the Reincarnation of India’s Living Dead?,2018,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,0.8174234722492674,"A large number of studies have found a negative correlation between economic growth and corruption. Therefore, governments implement various anti-corruption measures particularly technology-based mechanisms. The government of India has launched various initiatives such as Digital India and Digital India Land Records Modernization Program (DILRMP) to modernize land records in the country and curb the corruption at various levels of land transactions. However, despite a push for reform through the DILRMP, India's current land title management system remains plagued with deficiencies. The current system of land records and property ownership is rife with corruption. DILRMP is heavily dependent on the government functionaries to act as a trusted third party for the verification of data and processing of deeds. This leaves a space for unscrupulous elements to trick the system and register a fraudulent deed, transfer land titles, and so on. This paper investigates the usefulness of an emerging technology called Blockchain and its integration with India's biometric identity program called Aadhaar for management of land records and property registration. This paper proceeds with relevant case studies, by identifying the requirements and outlining the concept and system architecture for such a solution. From our analysis, we conclude that the blockchain technology in association with Aadhaar would be an effective mechanism to bring in much-needed transparency in the government functionaries, eradicate fraud and corruption, and enhance socioeconomic benefits.",10.1109/3ICT.2018.8855731,P.

A Framework to Make Voting System Transparent Using Blockchain Technology,2022,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,1.0,"A widespread mistrust towards the traditional voting system has made democratic voting in any country very critical. People have seen their fundamental rights being violated. Other digital voting systems have been challenged due to a lack of transparency. Most voting systems are not transparent enough; this makes it very difficult for the government to gain voters’ trust. The reason behind the failure of the traditional and current digital voting system is that it can be easily exploited. The primary objective is to resolve problems of the traditional and digital voting system, which include any kind of mishap or injustice during the process of voting. Blockchain technology can be used in the voting system to have a fair election and reduce injustice. The physical voting systems have many flaws in it as well as the digital voting systems are not perfect enough to be implemented on large scale.

Ensuring Proof-of-Authenticity of IoT Edge Devices Using Blockchain Technology,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.877633819705357,"Imposter devices pose serious threats. The majority of low-cost edge devices can easily be counterfeited or cloned; the supply chain is insufficiently secure. Reliability of deployed devices can be called into question simply because they might be counterfeit or cloned. It is a must to identify edge devices' sourcing uniquely and verify their validity periodically at runtime. We integrate blockchain technology to authenticate resource-constrained, low-cost edge devices. We use SRAM-based physically unclonable functions (PUFs)to generate unique “digital fingerprints” (device IDs). Registered manufacturers upload a cryptographic hash of each device ID to a “globally accessible” blockchain instance (key-value store or smart contract). While registering/designating a device locally, the end-user verifies whether the hash is present in that blockchain. We utilize a “locally permissioned” blockchain infrastructure (which is still a globally managed blockchain or, in future, a sidechain)to authenticate edge devices for a defense-in-depth approach. Devices can authenticated periodically to prevent device cloning. Target environments can be large and have varied trust among users and lack a specific perimeter; this “local” blockchain methodology is thus pertinent, especially since blockchains gain security over time. Our approach reduces the potential for classes of information leakage and types of sabotage in a critical infrastructure or large-scale deployment (such as a smart city)arising from imposter devices. This methodology protects against such imposters in mobile settings within an IoT infrastructure too.",10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00193,U. Guin; P. Cui; A. Skjellum

E-waste Management Using Blockchain based Smart Contracts,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7879035003364728,"In the world of technology, change is the only constant. As soon as people start adapting to a new invention, another innovation starts paving its way into people's lives. Each change in technology brings in new and improved devices. Old devices are replaced and abandoned. Such Electronic and Electrical Equipments (EEEs) that are discarded by users are termed as e-waste. Management of e-waste includes proper collection, segregation and recycling of discarded devices in an environment friendly manner. The volume of EEEs that is produced throughout the world, has led governments in various countries to create strict policies, to ensure efficient disposal of the generated e-waste. The Indian government also upgraded its E-Waste Management (EWM) laws in 2016 and 2018. These laws are a step towards environment friendly disposal of e-waste but their compliance is still at a nascent stage. Even today, e-waste collection and recycling in India is largely dominated by the unorganized sector, which makes the enforcement of such laws very difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for EWM using blockchain based smart contracts. Blockchain is the technology that enables us to write smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing computer codes that take specified actions when certain conditions are met in the real world. EWM using smart contracts will bring more coordination among producers, importers, retailers and recyclers of EEEs. It will enable the government to regulate e-waste collection and recycling. It will also reduce the imbalance between the organized and unorganized sectors which will lead to increased transparency throughout the process.",10.1109/ICACCI.2018.8554912,N. Gupta; P. Bedi

Blockchain Adoption in the Low-Carbon Supply Chain: A Comparative Analysis of Different Adoption Modes,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Low-carbon supply chain (LCSC) companies mitigate their carbon footprint through direct emission reduction (DER) efforts, such as using renewable energy, and through emissions trading for indirect offset. Blockchain technology, increasingly adopted in sectors, such as fashion and automotive, supports these methods by addressing key challenges. However, the optimal adoption mode—government, manufacturer, or retailer—remains unclear. In this article, we integrate blockchain's three benefits (reduced DER cost, lower transaction cost in emissions trading, and enhanced green trust) and its three costs (setup cost, operational cost, and usage fee) to compare these modes based on the LCSC's sustainability, profitability, and social welfare. Key findings are as follows. First, blockchain adoption typically boosts sustainability and profitability, although two tradeoffs require careful consideration. Second, retailer adoption outperforms the other modes by significantly enhancing sustainability, maximizing blockchain user profits, and achieving the highest social welfare outcomes. The retailer's profit can also be maximized if the setup cost coefficient and total carbon footprint level are sufficiently low. Another advantage of this mode lies in the flexibility of usage fee. Third, the impact of blockchain adoption varies across supply chains with different carbon footprint levels. These results remain robust in extension with risk considerations. This study provides valuable managerial insights, including guidance for LCSC on selecting the optimal blockchain adoption mode, and recommendations for policymakers to address the lack of economic incentives in low-emission supply chains and reduce the overreliance on indirect offset in high-emission ones.",10.1109/TEM.2025.3551770,Y.

Privacy-Preserving Support Vector Machine Training Over Blockchain-Based Encrypted IoT Data in Smart Cities,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used in many smart city sectors, where a huge amount of data is gathered from various (IoT) devices. As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",10.1109/JIOT.2019.2901840,M. Shen; X. Tang; L. Zhu; X. Du; M. Guizani

Blockchain-Based Trust Mechanism for IoT-Based Smart Manufacturing System,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7412907875080039,"Integrated and collaborative manufacturing system develops as massive data are obtained by the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, the “trust tax” imposed on manufacturers during their countless collaborations with customers, suppliers, distributors, governments, service providers, and other manufacturers is very high. Blockchain is an emerging technology that can lead to more transparent, secure, and efficient transactions. It represents a new paradigm, as well as new thinking, of how data can be securely stored, integrated, and communicated among different stakeholders, organizations, and systems that unnecessarily trust each other. Blockchain is greatly useful for reducing the “trust tax,” especially beneficial for the small- and medium-sized enterprises that must tolerate much heavier trust tax than the established manufacturers. This paper investigates the blockchain-based security and trust mechanism and elaborates a particular application of blockchain for quality assurance, which is one of the strategic priorities of smart manufacturing. Data generated in a smart manufacturing process can be leveraged to retrieve material provenance, facilitate equipment management, increase transaction efficiency, and create a flexible pricing mechanism.

A Platform Architecture for Multi-Tenant Blockchain-Based Systems,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5745033310961896,"Blockchain has attracted a broad range of interests from start-ups, enterprises and governments to build next generation applications in a decentralized manner. Similar to cloud platforms, a single blockchain-based system may need to serve multiple tenants simultaneously. However, design of multi-tenant blockchain-based systems is challenging to architects in terms of data and performance isolation, as well as scalability. First, tenants must not be able to read other tenants' data and tenants with potentially higher workload should not affect read/write performance of other tenants. Second, multi-tenant blockchain-based systems usually require both scalability for each individual tenant and scalability with number of tenants. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scalable platform architecture for multi-tenant blockchain-based systems to ensure data integrity while maintaining data privacy and performance isolation. In the proposed architecture, each tenant has an individual permissioned blockchain to maintain their own data and smart contracts. All tenant chains are anchored into a main chain, in a way that minimizes cost and load overheads. The proposed architecture has been implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype with our industry partner, Laava ID Pty Ltd (Laava). We evaluate our proposal in a three-fold way: fulfilment of the identified requirements, qualitative comparison with design alternatives, and quantitative analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed architecture can achieve data integrity, performance isolation, data privacy, configuration flexibility, availability, cost efficiency and scalability.",10.1109/ICSA.2019.00019,I.

Counterfeit Drug Prevention in Pharma Supply Chain using Blockchain Technology,2023,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.8505140121855574,"Fake drugs are a growing serious issue related to the healthcare industry which causes extraordinary dangers to the society and the environment. Tracing the drugs at every step of the pharma supply chain is a difficult task. The goal of the research is to create a blockchain-based model that can forestall drug forging in drug store networks. The scope of the research lies where irregularities in the pharmaceutical supply chain affect public health and economy. The advanced elements of Blockchain makes it fit for complete recognizability of medications from producer to end patients, and the capacity to prevent fake prescriptions or medications. Drugs change proprietorship from producers to distributors and afterward retailers before it arrives at the client. Through the proposed model, the producer would have the option to transfer the subtleties relating to a medication, after which it will be sent for endorsement to the Government. From there on, distributors and retailers, in view of their prerequisites, can demand the endorsed drugs. Later on, in the event that a patient needs some drug, the person should demand it on the blockchain network. The solicitation will be shipped off the closest retailer/drug store and from that point, the patient can gather their medicine. Hyperledger fabric is utilized because they are permissioned and have an open source blockchain framework, meaning all the organization and pears are well known and confirmed. Our execution of the proposed blockchain based model features that the model can effectively forestall any medication being fake.

Blockchain based Authentication and Privacy Preservation in IoMT Devices,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"A decentralised, distributed, open, and transparent digital ledger that keeps track of transactions among a number of computers is what is meant by the term ""blockchain."" By creating Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, in 2008 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, a person or group created a revolutionary technology. Designing a solution to the issue of confidence in digital transactions, which would do away with the need for middlemen like banks or governments to verify and approve transactions, was urgently needed. The blockchain was created as a result of several important considerations. First, the blockchain addressed the problem of double spending, in which digital currency might be duplicated and used more than once, by developing a decentralised consensus system that validates transactions and upholds a single source of truth. Second, blockchain introduced the idea of ""smart contracts,"" which are self-executing contracts that autonomously enforce terms and conditions by doing so without the use of intermediaries, thereby increasing efficiency and lowering costs across a range of businesses. As each transaction is recorded on a block that is linked to earlier blocks in a chronological and immutable manner, creating a visible and auditable history of all transactions, bringing transparency to transactions was Blockchain's biggest accomplishment. This has repercussions for supply chain management, electoral processes, and other sectors where accountability and openness are crucial.",10.1109/ICEMCE57940.2023.10434087,S. Rajvanshi; S. Sharma

Although blockchain can effectively enhance the network security and achieve fault tolerance, the huge resource consumption and limited performance of data processing restrict its deployments in IoT scenarios. Observing the heterogeneity and resource constraints, we intend to make blockchain accommodate both wimpy and brawny IoT devices. In this article, we present Tornado, a high-performance blockchain system based on space-structured ledger and corresponding algorithms, to enable blockchain in IoT. Specifically, we first design a space-structured chain architecture with novel data structures for promoting the network scalability. To address the huge heterogeneity of IoT, a novel consensus mechanism named collaborative-proof of work is developed. Moreover, we propose the space-structured greedy heaviest-observed subtree (S2GHOST) protocol for improving the resource efficiency of IoT devices. Additionally, a dynamic weight assignment mechanism in S2GHOST contributes to reflect the trustworthiness of data and devices.

Cost-efficient Blockchain-based e-KYC Platform using Biometric verification,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Know Your Customer (KYC) is the authentication and verification process of the user carried out in the financial sector by institutions such as banks, insurance companies, fintech companies, etc., and other sectors such as smart healthcare, real estate, telecommunication, online gaming and gambling companies before engaging in any financial activities. The KYC process is made mandatory for Financial Institutions (FIs) by governments worldwide to keep a check on terror financing and money laundering activities. However, the traditional physical KYC process has limitations such as high operational costs, large time consumption, privacy and security issues, repetitive processes across multiple institutions and user inconvenience. Hence, the FIs are looking for alternatives to the physical KYC. The digitization of the KYC process, known as e-KYC, was explored but had problems such as a single point of failure, repetition of KYC process across multiple FIs and lack of security. Blockchain-based e-KYC has become popular these days and caught the eye of FIs due to inherent properties of the blockchain such as decentralization, transparency, and immutable ledger. Moreover, blockchain-based solution is highly secure and cost-efficient. This paper proposes a blockchain-based e-KYC platform where users can register themselves and get their video KYC done after ether payment. Once successfully verified, the user will receive a KYC key. The user will submit this key to the banks or other FIs in which he wants to register. The FIs can verify whether the user has undergone the KYC process by looking in the blockchain using the KYC key. Our solution requires the user to submit his documents only at the e-KYC platform and not at different FIs for registration, thus preserving his privacy and, at the same time, ensuring the user’s authenticity.",10.1109/ICOIN59985.2024.10572111,S.

There are a lot of recent studies focusing on blockchain usage in healthcare in literature. However, they still have flaws in granting full authorization to individuals, ensuring the security of personal information, speed, and scalability. They mostly use private or consortium blockchains. However, in a public blockchain, a system that everyone can participate in and follow provides more reliable information. At the same time, heavy and slow encryption techniques were used in the models proposed in the literature. Our study focuses on the usage of blockchain in combating pandemics by ensuring privacy and maintaining reliable medical data sharing during pandemics. The proposed system is implemented by leveraging public blockchain on Ethereum with smart contracts, IPFS for decentralized storage, and robust and fast encryption techniques like ChaCha20. In addition to existing techniques, the framework introduces innovative methods, such as storing encrypted keys alongside encrypted data in IPFS, which enhances security and scalability. We also eliminate the usage of doctors’ private keys. The framework grants patient’s full ownership of their medical data, aligning with GDPR requirements. Patients can grant or revoke access to their data, enhancing their control over personal information. The use of smart contracts to manage access rights ensures that only authorized parties can access the data, and patients can easily manage these permissions through a decentralized platform.

To support these efforts, the proposed solution aims to develop a fully-functional, automatic and blockchain-powered Carbon trading platform that enables market participants to track, manage and trade GHG Credits (often referred to as Carbon Credits) while also helping the government to verily actual emission reductions. Blockchain-based architecture ensures that emissions data is tamper-proof, auditable securely recorded, enhancing accountability and participant trust. The carbon trading platform runs on CAP-and-Trade mechanism which is Government regulated Compliance market, in which specific sectors and Companies (usually called as obligated entities) are designated allowed to generate a certain volume of emissions (i.e. a CAP, carbon emission limit, acts as a Carbon emission Allowance Permit for these carbon emitters). If they exceed this limit, they may purchase Carbon Credits from environmental projects or have to pay carbon heavy taxes.",10.1109/ICBDS61829.2024.10837557,C. Patil; K. Birla; P. S. Nikumb; H. K.

BRUSCHETTA: An IoT Blockchain-Based Framework for Certifying Extra Virgin Olive Oil Supply Chain,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Urban population is expected to continuously grow in size. The smart city concepts allows to handle the new challenges and issues created by this growth by applying a wide range of technologies that can provide citizens with a better living environment. Smart agriculture will play an important part of smart cities, as a sustainable and high quality food supply chain is crucial to facilitate the grow of human agglomerates. In this context, European laws imposes very strict requirements in the food industry, in order to ensure that food provenance is always guaranteed. Such fine-grained traceability can be only achieved by applying state-of-the-art technologies. In this paper, we present BRUSCHETTA, a blockchain-based application for the traceability and the certification of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) supply chain. EVOO is an emblematic food product for Italy, but it is also one of the most falsified ones. BRUSCHETTA provides a blockchain-based system to enforce the certification of this product by tracing its entire supply chain: from the plantation to the shops. The goal is to enable the final customer to access a tamper-proof history of the product, including the farming, harvesting, production, packaging, conservation, and transportation processes. BRUSCHETTA leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in order to interconnect sensors dedicated to EVOO quality control, and to let them operate on the blockchain. We also provide a support for the correct tailoring of the BRUSCHETTA blockchain system, and we propose a mechanism for its dynamic auto-tuning to optimize it in case of high loads.",10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2019.00049,A.

PPSF: A Privacy-Preserving and Secure Framework Using Blockchain-Based Machine-Learning for IoT-Driven Smart Cities,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7792599003762541,"With the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities have become the mainstream of urbanization. IoT networks allow distributed smart devices to collect and process data within smart city infrastructure using an open channel, the Internet. Thus, challenges such as centralization, security, privacy (e.g., performing data poisoning and inference attacks), transparency, scalability, and verifiability limits faster adaptations of smart cities. Motivated by the aforementioned discussions, we present a Privacy-Preserving and Secure Framework (PPSF) for IoT-driven smart cities. The proposed PPSF is based on two key mechanisms: a two-level privacy scheme and an intrusion detection scheme. First, in a two-level privacy scheme, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the IoT data and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is applied to transform raw IoT information into a new shape. In the intrusion detection scheme, a Gradient Boosting Anomaly Detector (GBAD) is applied for training and evaluating the proposed two-level privacy scheme based on two IoT network datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. We also suggest a blockchain-InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) integrated Fog-Cloud architecture to deploy the proposed PPSF framework. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the PPSF framework over some recent approaches in blockchain and non-blockchain systems.",10.1109/TNSE.2021.3089435,P. Kumar; R. Kumar; G.

It is also a key player behind the advancements in different sectors including healthcare, smart city, and logistics in addition to many other fields. In order to meet their design requirements, IoT uses various types of sensors, smart meters, RFIDs, and actuators resulting in networks of growing size and complexity. This comes at the price of raising scalability, security, authenticity, and reliability issues. Therefore, it is vital to thoroughly address the expected issues not to hurdle further evolution of IoT deployment. This is where blockchain fits. The emersion of blockchain technology promises to solve many IoT related issues. Blockchain's unique features of transparency, reliability, traceability, and security nominate it to play a pivotal role in improving IoT networks, resolving their issues, and facilitating their expansion.

On Improving SimBlock Blockchain Simulator,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8479057709006268,"Bitcoin-based smart city services are an ever increasing up-and-coming reality. For these services, simulating the Bitcoin blockchain is important to parametrize the system and tailor the costs and the economic incentives. In this regard, SimBlock simulator is the current state-of-the-art tool for blockchain simulations. Unfortunately, based on an up-to-date parametrization, SimBlock turns out not to simulate the mining of blocks. Furthermore, it does not simulate the incentive mechanism. These limitations strongly confine SimBlock's effective usage towards evaluating Bitcoin-based services relevant to many application contexts, including smart cities. To overcome these limitations, we propose an improved SimBlock's implementation. Upon it, we assess whether SimBlock can abstract the current Bitcoin blockchain. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed implementation can effectively simulate the current Bitcoin blockchain.

On Availability for Blockchain-Based Systems,2017,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.763638751081725,"Blockchain has recently gained momentum. Startups, enterprises, banks, and government agencies around the world are exploring the use of blockchain for broad applications including public registries, supply chains, health records, and voting. Dependability properties, like availability, are critical for many of these applications, but the guarantees offered by the blockchain technology remain unclear, especially from an application perspective. In this paper, we identify the availability limitations of two mainstream blockchains, Ethereum and Bitcoin. We demonstrate that while read availability of blockchains is typically high, write availability - for transaction management - is actually low. For Ethereum, we collected 6 million transactions over a period of 97 days. First, we measured the time for transactions to commit as required by the applications. Second, we observed that some transactions never commit, due to the inherent blockchain design. Third and perhaps even more dramatically, we identify the consequences of the lack of built-in options for explicit abort or retry that can maintain the application in an uncertain state, where transactions remain pending (neither aborted nor committed) for an unknown duration. Finally we propose techniques to mitigate the availability limitations of existing blockchains, and experimentally test the efficacy of these techniques.",10.1109/SRDS.2017.15,I. Weber; V.

In this context, blockchain networks enabled with unique features, such as decentralization, immutability, and traceability, have the potential to reshape and transform the conventional EoT systems with higher security levels. Particularly, the convergence of blockchain and EoT leads to a new paradigm, called BEoT that has been regarded as a promising enabler for future services and applications. In this article, we present a state-of-the-art review of recent developments in the BEoT technology and discover its great opportunities in many application domains. We start our survey by providing an updated introduction to blockchain and EoT along with their recent advances. Subsequently, we discuss the use of BEoT in a wide range of industrial applications, from smart transportation, smart city, smart healthcare to smart home, and smart grid.

VFChain: Enabling Verifiable and Auditable Federated Learning via Blockchain Systems,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as federated learning, has been applied to broad areas, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, smart city, and healthcare. Despite intensive research on federated learning, existing schemes are vulnerable to attacks and can hardly meet the security requirements for real-world applications. The problem of designing a secure federated learning framework to ensure the correctness of training procedure has not been sufficiently studied and remains open. In this paper, we propose VFChain, a verifiable and auditable federated learning framework based on the blockchain system. First, to provide the verifiability, a committee is selected through the blockchain to collectively aggregate models and record verifiable proofs in the blockchain. Then, to provide the auditability, a novel authenticated data structure is proposed for blockchain to improve the search efficiency of verifiable proofs and support a secure rotation of committee. Finally, to further improve the search efficiency, an optimization scheme is proposed to support multiple-model learning tasks. We implement VFChain and conduct extensive experiments by utilizing the popular deep learning models over the public real-world dataset.

Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving and Sustainable Data Query Service Over 5G-VANETs,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) play an important role in future smart city design to improve traffic safety and traffic congestion by sharing data collected by vehicles. For sharing the traffic data with other vehicles, the vehicular sensory data are usually uploaded to the cloud server. However, existing data sharing systems for VANETs cannot provide selective data with sufficient privacy protection. Moreover, some schemes also cannot ensure stable data accessibility and the integrity of retrieved data. On the other hand, with the improvements such as lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth, 5G technology brings more possibilities to future applications. The join of the software-defined networks (SDNs) also offers efficient and effective network management. This paper proposes a primitive vehicular communication system named blockchain-based privacy-preserving and sustainable data query service. The proposed scheme is designed to realize stable data accessibility by leveraging smart contracts and blockchain oracle. With the help of 5G technology and P2P file-sharing system, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the proposed scheme aims to support video downloading files with searchable capability and fairness. An incentive token mechanism is also equipped. The merit of auditability is ensured by Ethereum blockchain platform to support the accountability. Besides, we also evaluate its networking performance via SUMO and NS-3 simulators. Our simulation results show that the request-response delay of BPSDQS is less than existing blockchain-based proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme. Our simulation results also showed that the average request-response delay in our scheme can saving up to 98%.",10.1109/TITS.2022.3146322,L. -Y. Yeh; N. -X. Shen; R. -H. Hwang

Blockchain-Based Authentication and Explainable AI for Securing Consumer IoT Applications,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7652755579942161,"The consumer Internet of Things (IoT) applications in particular smart cities are mostly equipped with Internet-connected networked devices to improve city operations by giving access to a massive amount of valuable information. However, these smart devices in a smart city environment mostly use public channels to access and share data among different participants. This has introduced a great interest in using authentication and key agreement (AKA) mechanisms and intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. However, most of the AKA mechanisms have high computation and communication costs and cannot be trusted completely. On the other hand, the AI-based IDS are treated as blackbox by the security analyst due to their inability to explain the reasons behind the decision. In this direction, we have integrated blockchain-based AKA mechanism with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for securing smart city-based consumer applications. Specifically, first, the participating entities communicate with each other in a secure manner to exchange data using a blockchain-based AKA mechanism.

Because the primary stakeholders for public health data are different from clinical data, data are stored over multiple systems, making the retrieval of related public health data items a hard process. In such situations, blockchain technology may be used to connect and securely exchange those scattered data items. In this paper, we proposed an enterprise architecture (EA) for HIEs to adopt blockchain technology so they could store and exchange both clinical and other health related data for efficient general public healthcare management. With the proposed solution, HIEs can not only exchange relevant data items, but also securely manage, record, and transfer complete health records.

Redactable Blockchain using Enhanced Chameleon Hash Function,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5602852384925684,"Immutability is a core principle of blockchain platforms that help all participants to have an exact global log of transactions. Immutability is easier to achieve in permissioned blockchain platforms where a trusted group are the validators. In public platforms, this vital property of blockchain can be achieved only through decentralized economic mechanisms like Proof-of-Work(PoW). Blockchain along with the concept of asset tokenization provides liquidity to markets like stock trading and exchange other intangible objects. With changes in regulatory policies and/or government laws, there could be a requisite to alter the contents in such markets. We propose an idea of using Chameleon hash functions that will enable modification of a block without changing other block contents. In our proposal, the trapdoor key used to redact a block is split among major validators and is reconstructed using Multi-Party Computation(MPC). Redaction happens when the major validators agree the suggested changes by digitally signing the proposal. This eliminates the need to rely on a trusted party. We also propose an idea of using second trapdoor key that will be with the creator of the block.

Blocks' Network: Redesign Architecture Based on Blockchain Technology,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5098553032522154,"The internet is a global network that uses communication protocols. It is considered the most important system reached by humanity, which no one can abandon [1]. However, this technology has become a weapon that threatens the privacy of users, especially in the client-server model, where data is stored and managed privately. Additionally, users have no power over their data that store in a private server, which means users' data may interrupt by government or might be sold via service provider for-profit purposes. Furthermore, blockchain is a technology that we can rely on to solve issues related to client-server model if appropriately used. However, blockchain technology uses consensus protocol, which is used for creating an incontrovertible system of agreement between members across a distributed network [2]. Thus, the consensus protocol is used to slow all member down from generating too fast in order to control the network creation pattern, which leads to scalability and latency problems. This paper will present a platform that leverages modernize blockchain called Blocks' Network. The system is taking into consideration the issues related to privacy and confidentiality from the client-side model, and scalability and latency issues from the blockchain technology side. Blocks' network is a public and a permissioned network that use a multi-dimensional hash to generate multiple chains for the purpose of a systematic approach. The proposed platform is users' assembly point to create a decentralized network via P2P protocols. The system has a high data flow due to frequent use by participants (e.g., the use of the Internet). Besides, the system will store all traffic of the network overtly via Blocks' Network.",10.1109/ICII.2019.00017,M. Hanif; H. Song

DRL and Main-Side Blockchain Empowered Edge Computing Framework for Assistant Driving,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.856086812740963,"To provide intelligent and accurate assistant driving services in smart city, as well as ensure the security and tamper proof of vehicle data, this paper build a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and main-side blockchain empowered service framework. By storing driving data and vehicle information on the sidechain, while deploying index information on the mainchain, the main-side blockchain structure can enhance the scalability of blockchain, decrease the communication overhead, improve consensus efficiency, and avoid the leakage of data between different sidechains. However, the resource limited vehicles on sidechain cannot process numerous computation-intensive mining tasks in time, resulting in high service delays. Thus, this paper integrate mobile edge computing with blockchain system to design a double-layer mining service offloading mechanism, allowing the edge nodes and neighboring vehicles to form a cooperative mining network and collaboratively participate in mining process with specific offloading rates. The first layer uses Asynchronous Advantage Actor-critic (A3C) algorithm to efficiently offload partial mining task from the task vehicle to the road side unit (RSU), and the second layer applies double auction to specifically obtain the offloading rates from RSU to multiple service vehicles. Simulation results demonstrate that, our proposed mechanism outperforms other compared algorithms in the average profit and consensus delay.",10.1109/NOMS56928.2023.10154314,Y. Zhong; S. Xu; Z.

A Novel Blockchain-Based Integrity and Reliable Veterinary Clinic Information Management System Using Predictive Analytics for Provisioning of Quality Health Services,2021,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.8963629370547553,"The recent advances in information management systems coupled with machine learning algorithms paved the way for a significant revolution in animal healthcare industries. However, the data in such systems suffer from various challenges such as security, reliability, and convenience, to name a few. Traditional systems are not useful to meet these critical issues because these systems have not a consistent structure for data security and reliability policies. Therefore, a new solution is required to enhance data accessibility and should regulate government security policies to ensure the accountability of the usage of the medical records system. Moreover, it is also required to analyze historical data of veterinary clinic using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the future appointments scheduling requests, which is essential for veterinary management to drive better future decisions, for instance, future demands of medical supplies and to plan veterinary medical staff, etc. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel blockchain-based reliable and intelligent veterinary information management system (RIVIMS) using smart contract and machine learning techniques. The proposed RIVIMS consists of two main modules; blockchain-based secured veterinary information management, data and predictive analytics modules. First, a blockchain-based secure and reliable veterinary clinic information management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric. Second, a smart contract enabled data, and predictive analytics modules are developed using permissioned blockchain framework. The data and predictive modules aim to analyze veterinary clinic patients appointments data in order to discover underlying patterns and build a robust prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The data and predictive helps veterinary management to drive better future business decisions to provide better healthcare services to veterinary patients. Hyperledger Caliper is used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the performance of the developed blockchain-based system in terms of transaction per second, transaction success rate, transaction throughput, and transaction latency. Furthermore, machine learning performance measures have utilized, such as MAE, RMSE, and R2 score to evaluate the overall performance of the prediction model.

In countries where the epidemic is under control, the main mode of virus transmission is through the transport of imported refrigerated food from epidemic areas. Blockchain is a great way for the government to trace every piece of food. However, the high-performance requirements of the blockchain system for nodes limit its wide application. Several sharding-based blockchain systems have been proposed to solve this limitation. Which blocks should be saved by nodes in the sharding-based blockchain system is a new problem. To solve this problem, the optimized data storage method is proposed in this paper. Five features of block popularity are presented, including the objective feature of a block, the objective feature of the block associated with the node, the historical popularity, the hidden popularity and the storage requirements.

A Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity Empowered Digital Identity Platform,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Most of the existing identity systems are built on top of centralized storage systems. Storing identity data on these types of centralized storage platforms(e.g cloud storage, central servers) becomes a major privacy concern since various types of attacks and data breaches can happen. With this research, we are proposing blockchain and self-sovereign identity based digital identity (KYC - Know Your Customer) platform “Casper” to address the issues on centralized identity systems. “Casper ” is an Android/iOS based mobile identity wallet application that combines the integration of blockchain and a self-sovereign identity-based approach. Unlike centralized identity systems, the actual identities of the customer/users are stored in the customers’ mobile wallet application. The proof of these identities is stored in the blockchain-based decentralized storage as a self-sovereign identity proof. Casper platforms’ Self-Sovereign Identity(SSI)-based system provides a Zero Knowledge Proof(ZKP) mechanism to verify the identity information. Casper platform can be adopted in various domains such as healthcare, banking, government organization etc. As a use case, we have discussed building a digital identity wallet for banking customers with the Casper platform.

CloudChain: A Cloud Blockchain Using Shared Memory Consensus and RDMA,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.577117469354349,"Blockchain technologies can enable secure computing environments among mistrusting parties. Permissioned blockchains are particularly enlightened by companies, enterprises, and government agencies due to their efficiency, customizability, and governance-friendly features. Obviously, seamlessly fusing blockchain and cloud computing can significantly benefit permissioned blockchains; nevertheless, most blockchains implemented on clouds are originally designed for loosely-coupled networks where nodes communicate asynchronously, failing to take advantages of the closely-coupled nature of cloud servers. In this paper, we propose an innovative cloud-oriented blockchain – CloudChain, which is a modularized three-layer system composed of the network layer, consensus layer, and blockchain layer. CloudChain is based on a shared-memory model where nodes communicate synchronously by direct memory accesses. We realize the shared-memory model with the Remote Direct Memory Access technology, based on which we propose a shared-memory consensus algorithm to ensure presistence and liveness, the two crucial blockchain security properties countering Byzantine nodes. We also implement a CloudChain prototype based on a RoCEv2-based testbed to experimentally validate our design, and the results verify the feasibility and efficiency of CloudChain.",10.1109/TC.2022.3147960,M.

Blockchain-Based Distributed Renewable Energy Management Framework,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Most of the world’s countries are concerned with reducing harmful gas emissions. Some governments have made considerable attempts to address this problem. Saudi Arabia, for example, has taken significant steps to utilize renewable energy (RE) sources in addition to oil and gas. Consumers are encouraged to build small RE systems. These small grids will help people meet their daily electrical energy requirements. They can sell the excess to other customers. One of the major issues is managing the distribution and sale of RE. Blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) networks can help overcome several obstacles to the implementation of a distributed RE management system (DREMS). However, several impediments may still stand in the way of its execution. Scalability and productivity are two of the most important considerations. The number of transactions made to the Blockchain network will increase in lockstep with the number of energy consumers. This will result in a significant lag in response. Understanding the renewable distributed energy system will aid in minimizing the effects of these roadblocks. Therefore, this research identifies the RE systems installation approaches, and how Blockchain technology can be utilized. It provides the solution requirements of any DREMS.

A Blockchain Supported Model for Secure Exchange of Land Ownership: An Innovative Approach,2022,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,0.9678560256491477,"Due to the duplicity and inefficiencies in the current land registration system, the land records are not secured, and citizens face the brunt of this. Similar to this, thousands of people are dealing with this situation. Fraudsters use numerous faults in the current property registration process to swindle both the public and the government. The implementation of a secure land registration using Blockchain and majority consensus is examined in this study. The adoption of Blockchain by the land register significantly lowers security issues. Since each block is linked to the hash of the one before it, each block’s hash value will be unique. It uses a hashing algorithm known as SHA256. The security of the data linked with each transaction is improved by the Proof of Work (PoW) method with SHA256. Each hash in the message digest is fixed for all the blocks and represents the complete collection of transactions contained in these blocks. The responsibility for mining new blocks, chaining with existing Blockchain and validating transactions falls on a node. Hashes are used to link transactions together via merge trees, which requires less storage. Thus, a 99% decrease in the human record-keeping effort is offered by the suggested usage of Blockchain for land registration.",10.1109/ICCCIS56430.2022.10037224,S. K. Rana; S. K. Rana; A. K.

Although they are tightly interconnected, it is difficult to evaluate their degree of interdependence. Keeping up with the pace of technology can be a challenging task, mainly when updating the hardware and software infrastructure. Every day, corporations and governments are faced with this issue; most have been victims of cyber attacks, security breaches, and data leaks. The consequences are significant in monetary losses; damage remediation is unattainable, even impossible, in certain circumstances. The repercussions might include reputational damage, legal responsibility, and threats to national security (when attacks are carried out against critical infrastructures to control the resources of a country), to name a few. Similarly, data has become such an integral part of many industries that it is one of the most critical targets for attackers that often is encrypted by ransomware, stolen, or corrupted. Without data, many companies are not able to continue operating as they do. The combination of all these factors complicates the ability of organizations to cooperate, trust, and share information in efforts to research and develop solutions for industry and government.This work proposes a Blockchain-based infrastructure solution provided by “Hyperledger Fabric” technology for companies to securely transmit and share information using the latest encryption and data storage technologies operating on the model of distributed systems and smart contracts.

Blockchain Based an Efficient and Secure Privacy Preserved Framework for Smart Cities,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Building smart services for smart cities has become a significant focus of the Internet of Things (IoT). These IoT devices are able to sense their surroundings and react appropriately. Smart city applications emphasize the necessity of safe data sharing across heterogeneous devices. Certain behaviors taken while sharing could aim at compromising security, privacy, and integrity. The centralized repository that is currently in place made the majority of hacks possible. The sharing of sensitive data and authentication are essential stages in guaranteeing the security of applications associated with IoT. Blockchain and IoT are two widely used technologies, with IoT focusing on data collection via various devices and blockchain enabling data integrity. This paper introduces a novel blockchain-based framework to ensure the security and integrity aspects of IoT data.

However, as blockchain can only support simple digital assets such as digital currencies and tokens, it cannot implement the trusted collaboration of complex digital assets in the metaverse. Therefore, this article proposes a blockchain-based trusted collaborative network infrastructure for future digital economy and society—DareChain. DareChain has proposed a novel collaborative-worker multi-chain system, trusted subject-object account model, layered model of smart contracts supporting trusted interactions, hyperlinear ledger consensus algorithm, and transaction model that supports privacy protection. It has been explored in metaverse applications in various scenarios such as government affairs, medical care, and finance to solve problems such as single content expression, few applications of business scenarios, low throughput, and easy leakage of security and privacy when blockchain is used as the underlying trusted collaborative network for the metaverse.",10.26599/IJCS.2023.9100025,Q.

The Impact of Crypto-Currency Risks on the Use of Blockchain for Cloud Security and Privacy,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7960234761299684,"A great many cloud users face a difficult challenge in respect of the forthcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into effect on 25th May, 2018. While all computer systems are continuously under attack, those who operate conventional distributed network systems stand a far greater chance of being able to demonstrate compliance than those who use cloud based systems. The main reason for this discrepancy between the two approaches is down to the as yet unsolved cloud forensic problem, meaning many cloud users will be completely unable to demonstrate compliance with the new regulation, thus exposing themselves to potentially massive fines after 25th May. We consider the possible use of a crypto-currency based mechanism to address the as yet unsolved cloud forensic problem. Crypto-currencies are becoming a global phenomenon, gaining more attention from media, venture capitalists, financial and government institutions. We focus on the operational risk and the market risk related to crypto-currencies, especially the dominating Bitcoin. Operational risk encompasses the actions that undermine the technological infrastructure and security assumptions of crypto-currencies. We discuss how blockchain technology could improve the efficiency of financial infrastructures, as well as the inevitable vulnerabilities of operational risk of software, open-source governance, and code maintenance. We summarise the literature findings on the co-movement of crypto- currencies with different currencies, indices, and commodities, to show the role of crypto-currency as a commodity, currency, or a speculative investment under portfolio diversification theory. Particularly now that we have seen successful attacks on crypto- currencies in action, it is important to understand where these weaknesses lie, and to endeavour to find out to what extent the use of such technology might expose companies using this technology for GDPR compliance. In the light of the robustness of this approach, we consider whether the underlying blockchain technology could, in turn, be practically applied to addressing the cloud forensic problem. This paper looks at the pros and cons of the blockchain/bitcoin approach, seeking to identify weaknesses, potential benefits offered versus the additional resource costs/latency involved, and considers whether such an approach might be used to secure cloud forensic trails.",10.1109/HPCS.2018.00111,Y.

The IoT is provided with the advantage of susceptibility that cybercriminals and other malicious users. Even though smart cities are intended to extend productivity and efficiency, residents and authorities face risks when they avoid cybersecurity. The conventional blockchain methods were introduced to ensure the secure management and examination of the smart city big data. But, the blockchains are found to have computationally high costs, and failed to improve the security, not adequate resource-constrained IoT devices have been designated for smart cities. In order to address these issues, the proposed novel blockchain model called blockchain secured Merkle hash zero correlation distinguisher (BSMH-ZCD) is suitable for IoT devices within the cloud infrastructure. The objective of the BSMH-ZCD method is to enhance security and reduce the run time and computational overhead. Initially, the Merkle hash tree is used to create the hash value with every transaction. Next, the zero correlation distinguisher is applied to perform the data encryption and decryption operation for the ARX block for obtaining proficient secure data access in the IoT devices.

Protecting the Integrity of IoT Sensor Data and Firmware With A Feather-Light Blockchain Infrastructure,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8805366051408484,"Smart cities deploy large numbers of sensors and collect a tremendous amount of data from them. For example, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs), which consist of physical meters that collect usage data about public utilities such as power and water, are an important building block in a smart city. In a typical sensor network, the measurement devices are connected through a computer network, which exposes them to cyber attacks. Furthermore, the data is centrally managed at the operator’s servers, making it vulnerable to insider threats.Our goal is to protect the integrity of data collected by large-scale sensor networks and the firmware in measurement devices from cyber attacks and insider threats. To this end, we first develop a comprehensive threat model for attacks against data and firmware integrity, which can target any of the stakeholders in the operation of the sensor network. Next, we use our threat model to analyze existing defense mechanisms, including signature checks, remote firmware attestation, anomaly detection, and blockchain-based secure logs. However, the large size of the Trusted Computing Base and a lack of scalability limit the applicability of these existing mechanisms. We propose the Feather-Light Blockchain Infrastructure (FLBI) framework to address these limitations. Our framework leverages a two-layer architecture and cryptographic threshold signature chains to support large networks of low-capacity devices such as meters and data aggregators. We have fully implemented the FLBI’s end-to-end functionality on the Hyperledger Fabric and private Ethereum blockchain platforms.

After a transaction is validated and cryptographically verified generates “block” on the BC and transactions are ordered chronologically and cannot be altered. Implementing BC and smart contracts technologies will bring security features for IoV. It plays a role to implement the rules and policies to govern the IoV information and transactions and keep them into the BC to secure the data and for future uses.",10.1109/MASS50613.2020.00013,P.

"Blockchain and AI-Empowered Healthcare Insurance Fraud Detection: an Analysis, Architecture, and Future Prospects",2022,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.9154033968764083,"Nowadays, health insurance has become an essential part of people’s lives as the number of health issues increases. Healthcare emergencies can be troublesome for people who can’t afford huge expenses. Health insurance helps people cover healthcare services expenses in case of a medical emergency and provides financial backup against indebtedness risk. Health insurance and its several benefits can face many security, privacy, and fraud issues. For the past few years, fraud has been a sensitive issue in the health insurance domain as it incurs high losses for individuals, private firms, and governments. So, it is essential for national authorities and private firms to develop systems to detect fraudulent cases and payments. A high volume of health insurance data in electronic form is generated, which is highly sensitive and attracts malicious users. Motivated by these facts, we present a systematic survey for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain-enabled secure health insurance fraud detection in this paper. This paper presents a taxonomy of various security issues in health insurance. We proposed a blockchain and AI-based secure and intelligent system to detect health insurance fraud. Then, a case study related to health insurance fraud is presented. Finally, the open issues and research challenges in implementing the blockchain and an AI-empowered health insurance fraud detection system is presented.",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3194569,K. Kapadiya; U.

A Taxonomy of the Risks and Challenges of Embracing Blockchain Smart Contracts in Facilitating Renewable Electricity Transactions,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8782851841134663,"Environmental imperatives and global energy supply crisis are driving interests in the renewable electricity industry. Yet, the revenue risks of renewable generators make it challenging for them to attract finance from traditional investors. Several mechanisms have been proposed to minimize these risks but have their limitations. Blockchain smart contract arrangements have emerged as a new marketplace, addressing the shortcomings of these traditional electricity hedging mechanisms. However, they have their peculiar challenges, potentially impeding their mainstream adoption in the renewable electricity industry. Hence, this paper develops a novel taxonomy of the risks and challenges of embracing blockchain smart contracts in facilitating renewable electricity transactions. Examining these issues indicates that the adoption of blockchain smart contracts in the renewable energy industry can be facilitated by cooperation and partnerships between technology developers and researchers, renewable energy companies, as well as governments.",10.1109/PowerAfrica53997.2022.9905345,O.

Blockchain-based photovoltaic subsidy trading mechanism design,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9834936404878571,"Due to the large number of internal and external collaborators, complex business processes and long cycle chains, the domestic PV subsidy issuance process generally suffers from problems such as subsidy delinquency, settlement difficulties and low regulatory transparency, which cannot meet the business objectives of accurate fund disbursement, immediate business response and transparent subsidy issuance. Blockchain technology has become a new type of distributed bookkeeping and clearing application mode by virtue of its security, decentralization and difficulty in tampering. Scholars at home and abroad have also put forward architectural ideas for the application of blockchain technology in the energy sector. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based PV subsidy transaction mechanism. In order to finally achieve consistency in the settlement results of metering data by multiple parties of subsidies, we study mechanisms such as PV power generation deposit method, PV subsidy metering data pre-settlement verification, and consensus on the consistency of subsidy amount, and form a decision on whether to submit a completed settlement transaction by endorsing the verification of the results of pre-settlement of metering data by power grids, power generation enterprises and governments. In order to verify the feasibility of the above technology, simulations are conducted for a network topology of 8 nodes for 3 types of subjects, which can support PV subsidy settlement nd PV subsidy business issuance.",10.1109/CICED56215.2022.9929193,S.

Our TCHs are sensitive to accidental or malicious content modification (tampering). The focus of our self-supervised HAAE is to guard against content modification such as frame truncation or corruption but ensure invariance against format shift (i.e. codec change). This is necessary due to the curatorial requirement for archives to format shift video over time to ensure future accessibility. Second, we describe how the TCHs (and the models used to derive them) are secured via a proof-of-authority blockchain distributed across multiple independent archives.

A Blockchain-based Reputation System for Small Satellite Relay Networks,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7247358671383992,"Currently, space communications networks are attempting to move away from large geostationary (GEO) satellites towards large constellations of small satellites. This trend is observed both in government and commercial communications satellites. By relaying data across multiple constellations/networks, we may be able to reduce end-to-end latencies and reduce burden (mass, power, cost) for all users. However, this is only possible if networks across constellations can establish inter-satellite authentication and trust. The key to this trust is based on demonstrated ability of the relay satellites to meet performance requirements, i.e. “reputation.” In this work, we propose leveraging distributed ledger technologies (i.e. blockchains) to develop a secure, decentralized reputation system for satellite relay networks. This informs a reputation-aware routing protocol and reduces the average data latency across the network. In this paper, we discuss designing the blockchain-based reputation system and routing protocol. We then analyze the resultant network performance with respect to average latency, computational complexity, and storage considerations for a variety of use cases.",10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172516,L.

Blockchain Enables Your Bill Safer,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8961875816683199,"As one of the most frequently used Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, energy smart meter has been widely adopted to facilitate the measures of residential energy use. Residents pay for the bills from energy suppliers according to their monthly/seasonal usage. Practically, there is a demand from residents/governments to check whether the bills are in line with their real consumptions. However, it is challenging to realize this demand due to two critical problems. The first problem refers to the nonrepudiated privacy issue caused by access to residents’ energy consumption history (e.g., data integrity may be questioned, and residents’ daily timetables may be exposed). The second problem comes from the efficiency requirement for bulk auditing requests on residents’ bills and consumptions, usually risen by governments. So far, we have not found any solutions that can be directly used in this case. In this article, we propose using homomorphic encryption cooperated with the blockchain technique to leverage the data auditing and privacy-preserving requirements. We also employe a certificateless signature to resolve the efficiency bottleneck in batch auditing. This framework, called pAuditChain, not only accepts personal requests from residents for consumption checking but also handles bulk auditing requests issued by governments. To validate the correctness of the framework functions, we carried out a series of theoretical analysis, especially on the privacy preserving and auditing processes. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is among the first solutions to improve the security and privacy of bills without losing the auditing function. Our approach concerns with IoT smart meters in energy supply industries and could be further extended to other forms of IoT devices with the bill demands.",10.1109/JIOT.2020.3016721,Q. Wang; L.

A Blockchain-Based Framework for Supervision of Livelihood Issues: Proof of Concept With Optimized Consensus,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.624587804149261,"Supervision of Livelihood Issues (SLI) refers to the supervision and participation of the general public in government actions and public affairs, with a particular focus on issues closely related to people’s lives. However, current regulatory systems often suffers from information imbalances, low authenticity, and credibility. To address these challenges, this study proposes a blockchain-based SLI framework that leverages the decentralized, tamper-proof, traceable, and transparent nature of blockchain technology to provide a reliable platform for SLI. Furthermore, we designed an information data structure on the blockchain and presented the information flow process. We developed smart contracts that utilize automation capability to automatically aggregate, analyze, and publish warnings based on on-chain data, enabling the evaluation of relevant departments’ performance. Moreover, in the context of SLI applications, we propose an optimized consensus algorithm called the SLI-PBFT. This algorithm is based on the PBFT consensus protocol and incorporates dynamic scalability mechanisms, scoring models, and simplified consistency protocols to enhance the consensus efficiency of SLI applications. Finally, the experiments were conducted. We developed an SLI prototype system and compared and analyzed the performance of SLI-PBFT with other PBFT-based consensus algorithms within the SLI prototype system.

Authentication of Voter Using Convolutional Neural Network and Blockchain,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7038116437620799,"For elected officials and government policies to be credible and legitimate in today's democracies, voting systems must be fair and honest. Voter impersonation and ballot stuffing are just two examples of the many fraud and manipulation schemes that can be used against traditional voting systems. We suggest a novel method for voter authentication that combines blockchain technology and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to address these issues. Our suggested method entails gathering voter biometric information, such as facial recognition data, and putting it in a safe and immutable blockchain ledger. This ledger is virtually impossible to hack or manipulate because it is decentralized and replicated across numerous network nodes. After that, we compare the voter's identity to the information kept in the blockchain using a face recognition model based on CNN. This method enables us to protect the confidentiality and privacy of the personal data of voters while ensuring that only authorized voters can participate in the electoral process. On a real-world dataset, we put our suggested methodology to the test and show that it can accurately and securely authenticate voters. We also talk about the ethical issues that arise when implementing such a system, such as privacy, consent, and technology access.

Fair Outsourcing Paid in Fiat Money Using Blockchain,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.49450151328188874,"Seeking outsourcing from cloud service providers is common for resource-constrained users to complete complex computing. Conventional cloud computing outsourcing solutions focus on guiding users to verify the returned results, which is unfair since malicious users can refuse to pay by falsely claiming that the results are wrong. To address this problem, fair payment schemes, both blockchain-free and blockchain-based, have been proposed. However, the former is usually inefficient and the latter only supports payment through cryptocurrencies. The use of cryptocurrencies faces hurdles as it exposes cloud service providers to a significant risk of sharp currency price fluctuations, as well as vulnerability to government bans due to regulatory concerns. In contrast, fiat money payment is not only more in line with the business norm, but also naturally avoids the above troubles. Motivated by this, a blockchain-based fair outsourcing scheme to support payment in fiat money is proposed in this article.

BCACP-IoE: A Novel Blockchain-Based Security Access Control Protocol for Internet of Energy,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Thanks to the development of information technology, our energy system is gradually becoming connected and intelligent. The deep integration of the mature Internet of Things and various fields of energy forms the Internet of Energy (IoE), which can make an important contribution to improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, the continuous deepening of information technology in IoE, it also brings a lot of network security problems, because the essence of IoE information exchange is wireless communication. Such network security problems may result in the disclosure of private information of the power user side (PUS) to other unauthorized parties, or in the acquisition of trade secrets of the power supply side (PSS) by competitors. Therefore, we need to develop a specific data access protocol to ensure the communication security of IoE. This paper proposes a blockchain-based access control protocol for IoE, namely “BCACP-IoE”. As most grid companies (GC) are run by governments, BCACP-IoE treats them as trusted entities and designs secure access protocols for PSS/PUS-GC communication. Meanwhile, we use Ripple, a vote-based blockchain consensus algorithm, to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Through various security analyses, we prove the security of the BCACP-IoE against different types of potential attacks.

Decentralized Authentication of Distributed Patients in Hospital Networks Using Blockchain,2020,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.9578180892722113,"In any interconnected healthcare system (e.g., those that are part of a smart city), interactions between patients, medical doctors, nurses and other healthcare practitioners need to be secure and efficient. For example, all members must be authenticated and securely interconnected to minimize security and privacy breaches from within a given network. However, introducing security and privacy-preserving solutions can also incur delays in processing and other related services, potentially threatening patients lives in critical situations. A considerable number of authentication and security systems presented in the literature are centralized, and frequently need to rely on some secure and trusted third-party entity to facilitate secure communications. This, in turn, increases the time required for authentication and decreases throughput due to known overhead, for patients and inter-hospital communications. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized authentication of patients in a distributed hospital network, by leveraging blockchain. Our notion of a healthcare setting includes patients and allied health professionals (medical doctors, nurses, technicians, etc), and the health information of patients. Findings from our in-depth simulations demonstrate the potential utility of the proposed architecture. For example, it is shown that the proposed architecture's decentralized authentication among a distributed affiliated hospital network does not require re-authentication.

BloCkEd: Blockchain-Based Secure Data Processing Framework in Edge Envisioned V2X Environment,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8322910510483629,"There has been an increasing trend of moving computing activities closer to the edge of the network, particularly in smart city applications (e.g., vehicle-to-everything - V2X). Such a paradigm allows the end user's requests to be handled/processed by nodes at the edge of the network; thus, reducing latency, and preserving privacy of user data/activities. However, there are a number of challenges in such an edge computing ecosystem. Examples include (1) potential inappropriate utilization of resources at the edge nodes, (2) operational challenges in cache management and data integrity due to data migration between edge nodes, particularly when dealing with vehicular mobility in a V2X application, and (3) high energy consumption due to continuous link breakage and subsequent reestablishment of link(s). Therefore in this paper, we design a blockchain-based secure data processing framework for an edge envisioned V2X environment (hereafter referred to as BloCkEd). Specifically, a multi-layered edge-enabled V2X system model for BloCkEd is presented, which includes the formulation of a multi-objective optimization problem. In addition, BloCkEd comprises an optimal container-based data processing scheme, and a blockchain-based data integrity management scheme, designed to minimize link breakage and reducing latency.

A Novel Homomorphic Blockchain Scheme for Intelligent Transport Services in Fog/Cloud and IoT Networks,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8226139070893466,"Modern smart city services necessitate complex technological infrastructure with heterogeneous compute servers, networks, and communication protocols. However, there are many research issues in heterogeneous computing infrastructure for Intelligent transport systems (ITS) when using the services in the network. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to intelligent transportation services and their underlying infrastructure, built on an amalgamation of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing, and associated technologies. Specifically, this paper investigates the challenging issues of security, processing costs, and communication delays that frequently occur during the communication of data and messages. We propose novel, secure, and cost-effective schemes based on blockchain-assisted homomorphic encryption techniques. A Secure, Cost-Optimal Workload Assignment (SCWA) algorithm and a blockchain scheme made possible by Partially Hashing Homomorphic Encryption and Decryption (PHHE/D) are designed to distribute workload efficiently. We developed a simulator, MOTEL, that simulates the different functions of the proposed schemes and all the necessary components. Using MOTEL and data sets from real transport companies, the proposed approach is tested and evaluated using various experiments. The results demonstrate that, compared to existing solutions, the proposed approach significantly reduces processing costs and delays while maintaining an appropriate level of security in transport services.",10.1109/TITS.2024.3493452,A.

Combining Git and Blockchain for Trusted Information Sharing,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"We present PineSU, a lightweight system that integrates Git with the Ethereum blockchain for sharing electronic documents, enabling decentralized integrity protection and timestamping. PineSU introduces the concept of Storage Unit (SU for short), which is essentially a Git repository along with some descriptor files needed to interact with the blockchain. SUs can be open or closed. Open SUs serve to secure Git repositories whose content may change in the future. At any moment, users can create a Blockchain Synchronization Point (BSP for short) of their open SUs. This allows for a rigorous integrity and authenticity verification of the corresponding digital documents. Whereas closed SUs are mainly a mechanism to invalidate any change to a Git repository. They are useful when a set of files must be definitively archived and made immutable, while enabling their sharing securely. As shown by a case study on clones of two public repositories on GitHub (owned by the Italian government) containing reports and data about the COVID-19 diffusion, PineSU has proven to be very effective in protecting Git repositories under a few security hypotheses that are easy to guarantee in many circumstances. Furthermore, an experimental and simulated performance evaluation demonstrates that the system scales well for storage units of increasing sizes and structure complexity. Finally, a qualitative comparison with existing solutions shows the strengths of PineSU against state-of-the-art approaches.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3418749,L. Grilli; P. Speziali

Several sectors (e.g., business, healthcare, government, etc.) have witnessed recent cyber-attacks (e.g., HEalthEquity Data Breach, Capital One, Midnight Blizzard on Microsoft, etc.) on their computing systems. Our research focuses on security issues and conducts a literature review to address the integration of blockchain technology into Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) in the cloud environment pipeline to enhance security. The key idea rests on separating entities such as code, data, design, change history, etc., as “blocks” in the blockchain technology through “separation of concern”. Such modularisation should help contain any threats locally in the block concerned without affecting other blocks. Our initial focus is conducting a comprehensive review of existing literature to analyse and synthesise tools and technologies for integrating blockchain into the CI/CD pipeline on cloud services.

Enhanced Security Model for Digital Document Sharing in Cloud Using Blockchain and Attribute-Based Encryption,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6590823818061481,"This paper describes a cutting-edge security model, which utilizes blockchain and attribute-based encryption (ABE) technologies, to securely distribute digital assets in cloud infrastructures. Traditional cloud storage services, while efficient, have significant drawbacks such as high computational overhead and vulnerability to external intruders. The proposed hybrid model combines the immutability of blockchain and the privacy features of ABE’s fine-grained access control. Essentially, the model integrates a lightweight blockchain for transaction data storage with a multi-authority ABE scheme to decentralize trust and ensure privacy. Additionally, the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is employed as a decentralized file storage due to its integrity assurance and advanced deduplication methods, reducing redundancy. We envision smart contracts to emerge as compliance monitoring and attribute revocation tools, thus reducing computational costs and boosting system efficiency. Performance evaluations we conduct on the Ethereum network show that our model fulfills the necessary criteria in terms of scalability and security, exceeding current methods. This result strengthens the security resilience of the system against major security menaces such as password attack and plaintext search. These findings demonstrated the resilience and usability of our solution in areas of importance such as classrooms, healthcare, and government institutions in which privacy and accuracy are necessary.",10.1109/SUSTAINED63638.2024.11074232,U.

Even in the spectrum of prevailing concerns about the authenticity and origin of art pieces, brought about by problems that include replication and illegal alteration, blockchain provides a practical solution with its innate qualities, including immutability, transparency, and security. The smart contract project was based on a customizable blockchain protocol in which components were booked to suit the special needs of the digital artefacts. This approach, however, was embedded in features such as artefact registration and document recording, and these features worked best with strict access limits. First, a group of cultural products was selected and combined with some cultural heritage organizations and government institutions to test the pilot. The pilot test results had quite positive consequences for the regulation operation procedures. The statistical analysis revealed that the file management errors came down by half, and there was a marked reduction in the time spent on authentication-related problems; the average solution time was 4 hours. Also, the respondents who participated expressed more positive comments on the ideas of this method and pointed out the key advantages.

A Novel Stochastic Blockchain-Based Energy Management in Smart Cities Using V2S and V2G,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8283460053027956,"This paper proposes a secure management framework for optimal scheduling and operation of energy systems in smart cities, which will bring balance in modern power systems. The expanded infiltration of energy systems along with stochastic performance and high data transfer rate can bring new challenges that may severely affect precise energy management. This research work investigates the optimal and secure operation of energy systems in the presence of smart transportation systems in a correlated energy system. To achieve the maximum efficiency from the transportation system, the ideas of vehicle-to-subway (V2S) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) are utilized to develop a bilateral power flow strategy (charging/discharging or idle mode) to provide the chief charging requirements of energy systems. In this regard, the proposed model suggests a novel stochastic architecture based on unscented transformation (UT) to handle the operational uncertainties of the transportation systems when considering the correlated power generation of wind turbines (WTs). Moreover, blockchain technology is deployed to guarantee the security of data transfer within the smart city.

Quarks: A Secure and Decentralized Blockchain-Based Messaging Network,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.540236902655777,"Over the past two decades, the popularity of messaging systems has increased both in enterprise and consumer level. Many of these systems used secure protocols like end-to-end encryption to ensure strong security features such as “future secrecy” for one-to-one communication. However, the majority of them rely on centralized servers owned by big IT companies, which allows them to use their users’ personal data. Also it allows the government to track and regulate their citizens’ activities, which poses significant threats to “digital freedom”. Also, these systems have failed to achieve security attributes like confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and future secrecy for group communications. In this paper, we present a novel blockchain-based secure messaging system named Quarks that overcomes the security pitfalls of the existing systems and eliminates the centralized control. We have analyzed our design of the system with security models and definitions from existing literature to demonstrate the system’s reliability and usability. We have developed a Proof of Concept (PoC) of the Quarks system leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), and conducted load testing on that.

On the Design and Implementation of a Blockchain Enabled E-Voting Application Within IoT-Oriented Smart Cities,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9458784991246824,"A smart city refers to an intelligent environment obtained by deploying all available resources and recent technologies in a coordinated and smart manner. Intelligent sensors (Internet of Things (IoT) devices) along with 5G technology working mutually are steadily becoming more pervasive and accomplish users' desires more effectively. Among a variety of IoT use cases, e-voting is a considerable application of IoT that relegates it to the next phase in the growth of technologies related to smart cities. In conventional applications, all the devices are often assumed to be cooperative and trusted. However, in practice, devices may be disrupted by the intruders to behave maliciously with the aim of degradation of the network services. Therefore, the privacy and security flaws in the e-voting systems in particular lead to a huge problem where intruders may perform a number of frauds for rigging the polls. Thus, the potential challenge is to distinguish the legitimate IoT devices from the malicious ones by computing their trust values through social optimizer in order to establish a legitimate communication environment. Further, in order to prevent from future modifications of data captured by smart devices, a Blockchain is maintained where blocks of all legitimate IoT devices are recorded. This article has introduced a secure and transparent e-voting mechanism through IoT devices using Blockchain technology with the aim of detecting and resolving the various threats caused by an intruder at various levels.

A PUF-Based Lightweight Broadcast Authentication Protocol for Multi-Server Systems Using Blockchain,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"With the continuous innovation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, broadcasting plays as an essential message sharing role in smart city paradigms such as intelligent transportation, medical monitoring, emergency broadcasting. However, most of the IoT devices are resource-constrained and vulnerable to physical attack, more and more unauthorized message broadcast, modification, disclosure, destruction phenomena occur due to the concomitant key leakage issue which limits the application potential of message broadcasting. In this paper, a PUF-based lightweight broadcast authentication protocol for the IoT in multi-server systems using blockchain is proposed to ensure the security of the authenticated broadcast message. As an emerging physical security mechanism, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are utilized to provide a lightweight key agreement and authentication method for the resource-constrained IoT devices, which can reduce the overhead of cryptographic computation and effectively resist physical attacks. The blockchain is regard as a distributed database to manage the authentication materials for the IoT device and also has the ability to resist the message tampering and single-point failure.

ProductChain: Scalable Blockchain Framework to Support Provenance in Supply Chains,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"An increased incidence of food mislabeling and handling in recent years has led to consumers demanding transparency in how food items are produced and handled. The current traceability solutions suffer from issues such as scattering of information across multiple silos and susceptibility in recording erroneous data and thus are often unable to produce reliable farm to fork stories of products. Blockchain (BC) is a promising technology that could play an important role in providing data transparency and integrity due to its salient features which include decentralisation, immutability and auditability. In this paper, we propose a permissioned blockchain framework which is governed by a consortium of key Food Supply Chain (FSC) entities including government and regulatory bodies to promote food provenance. We propose to use a sharded, three-tiered architecture which ensures availability of data to consumers, limits access to competitive partners and provides scalability for handling transaction load. We also propose a transaction vocabulary and access rights to manage read and write privileges to BC supported by the consortium. The framework, ProductChain, ensures that trade flows are kept confidential when provenance information is retrieved by consumers and stakeholders.

Leveraging Distributed Blockchain-based Scheme for Wireless Network Virtualization with Security and QoS Constraints,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8549969027866008,"Wireless network virtualization is regarded as an emerging paradigm to enhance RF spectrum utilization to support exponentially increasing demand caused by emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. To create virtual wireless networks (VWNs), there are no automated secure approaches for allocating RF spectrum to meet the dynamically changing quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. In wireless networks, RF spectrum is shared among many users and the given RF spectrum could be easily overcrowded because of the over commitment of limited resources by the service providers. There is a direct incentive in terms of revenue to service providers to have more number of users. In this paper, we propose to leverage a distributed Blockchain - also known as a public ledger - based scheme to create VWNs where primary wireless resource-owners (PWROs) sublease their wireless resources (e.g., slice of RF spectrum, infrastructure) to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) using machine-to-machine communication based on the service level agreements (SLAs) between PWROs and MVNOs. The proposed distributed Blockchain-based scheme provides security to participating PWROs and MVNOs as well as prevents PWROs from over committing their resources (that stops double spending) and helps MVNOs to meet the QoS requirements of their users. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or similar regulatory bodies in other countries participate in this framework by providing the guidelines and regulations about maximum power levels, licensing and geographic coverages, etc. This essentially helps users to meet their desired QoS requirements while complying the government regulations. Performance is evaluated using numerical results.",10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390344,D. B. Rawat; A. Alshaikhi

To address these issues, the authors present a distributed and decentralized blockchain-software-defined networking (SDN)-based energy-aware architecture for IoT in smart cities. Thus, SDN is continuously observing, controlling, and managing IoT devices activities and detects possible attacks in the network; blockchain provides adequate security and privacy against cyber attacks, and reduces the central point of failure issues; network function virtualization (NFV) is used to saving energy, load balancing, as well as increasing the lifetime of the entire network.

HomeChain: A Blockchain-Based Secure Mutual Authentication System for Smart Homes,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9472178092781629,"Increasingly, governments around the world, particularly in technologically advanced countries, are exploring or implementing smart homes, or the related smart facilities for the benefits of the society. The capability to remotely access and control Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., capturing of images, audios, and other information) is convenient but risky, as vulnerable devices can be exploited to conduct surveillance or perform other nefarious activities on the users and organizations. This highlights the necessity of designing a secure and efficient remote user authentication solution. Most of the existing solutions for this problem are generally based on a single-server architecture, which has limitations in terms of privacy and anonymity (leading to users' daily activities being predicted), and integrity and confidentiality (resulting in an unreliable behavior auditing). While blockchain-based solutions may mitigate these issues, they still face some critical challenges (e.g., providing regulation of behaviors and privacy protection of access policy). Motivated by these facts, in this article, we construct a novel secure mutual authentication system, which can be applied in smart homes and other applications. Specifically, the proposed approach integrates blockchain, group signature, and message authentication code to provide reliable auditing of users' access history, anonymously authenticate group members, and efficiently authenticate home gateway, respectively. We also prove the security and privacy requirements, including anonymity, traceability, and confidentiality, that the proposed system satisfies, with an implementation and evaluation to demonstrate its practicality.",10.1109/JIOT.2019.2944400,C.

An IoT and Blockchain-Based Secure and Transparent Supply Chain Management Framework in Smart Cities Using Optimal Queue Model,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.811308351729748,"The process of controlling the flow of products and services from a company by encompassing each stage involved in transforming raw materials and parts into finished items, also delivering them to the final consumer is known as Supply Chain Management (SCM). The development of numerous smart city applications including smart grids, smart homes, smart supply chains, and smart healthcare has drawn attention to the Internet of Things (IoT). Nowadays, researchers are considering the smart healthcare system’s role as a Public Emergency Service (PES) to treat patients promptly. A distributed smart fire brigade system receives little attention like PES to save lives and property from catastrophic fire damage. The conventional PES methods are created using a centralized method that needs a lot of processing power and doesn’t offer timely services. The traditional systems developed for managing the supply chain have drawbacks like single-point failure issues, data integrity, transparency, and lack of trust. To alleviate the existing issues, in this paper, a Blockchain and IoT Enable Secure and Transparent Supply Chain Management framework is utilized for PES in the smart city environment. Further, two edge computing servers, like a service controller and an IoT controller are adapted. The local storage is handled by the service and IoT controller. Thus, it enhances the data processing speed of PES requests and PES fulfillment. The service controller utilizes the Optimal Queue Model to manage the PES requests based on the minimum service queue length. The efficiency of the network is improved by fine-tuning the parameters from the Queue model with the aid of a Revised Fitness-based Political Optimizer (RF-PO). The multi-objective constraints like queue length, utilization, actual arrival time, expected arrival time, and end-to-end delay are utilized for the efficient supply chain system. These stimulated results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the supply chain framework.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3376605,A. Y. A. B. Ahmad; N. Verma; N. M. Sarhan; E. M. Awwad; A. Arora; V. O.

Blockchain-based E-waste Management in 5G Smart Communities,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.80000454453705,"With our increasing reliance on technology, the amount of e-waste generated after their life cycle ends is increasing at an exponential rate. Going by this rate, we'll have an equivalent amount of carbon footprint as the transportation industry, only by the smartphone segment by 2035. We can imagine the total carbon footprint if we extend this to all the other numerous electronic gadgets we use. With the increasing volume of e-waste, the chances of these toxic non-biodegradable elements polluting the environment are astronomical. This problem is being addressed by various nations and laws to regulate the waste have been passed in recent years. The Indian Government has placed E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2011 which forms a part of the Environment Protection Act to ensure coherent disposal of e-waste. However, a rather large percentage of e-waste in India is still not regulated and it runs vastly by unorganized sectors. We provide a solution to the above problem by proposing an efficient e-waste management technique by using blockchain in the 5G scenario. Our solution keeps track of the e-waste generated and we provide an incentive-based system where users are encouraged to channelize their e-waste through government regulated agencies which efficiently dispose of them in an environment-friendly manner.

AI-Driven Legal Document Summarization and Blockchain-based Authenticity Verification for Enhanced Decision-Making,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9555333892262247,"In today’s digital age, the frequency of forgery and illegal use of legitimate documents has increased in most sectors, such as real estate, banking, corporate issues, and government documents. The traditional practice of signing documents on verified stamp papers could no longer serve as an adequate countermeasure against modern-day digital malpractices. The most common digital methods currently circulating provide either secure document delivery through cryptographic signatures or document analysis via AI, while very few cover both. This paper aims to present an integrated online application embracing two independent functions: document verification using blockchain techniques and document summarization using AI. This guarantees secure verification of documents through a mechanism that generates cryptographic hashes and compares them to the entries on a privately deployed Ethereum blockchain for tamper-evident yet nonrevealing authentication. Concurrently, the summarization module uses machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to allow users to extract key clauses and important terms from documents, thus saving a great deal of user effort in interpreting lengthy legal content. In contrast to existing systems focusing separately on security or content processing, this integrated platform unlike existing systems that focus either only on security or only on content processing, addresses both integrity and accessibility. The novelty, therefore, is having a single interface where users can check for a document’s legitimacy or summarize content as they see fit. The effectiveness of this system will be evaluated based on verification accuracy, summarization quality (ROUGE), and user satisfaction. Presented with a dual feature, this will pave the way for a practically and user-friendly way for secure digital legal document handling.",10.1109/ICICV64824.2025.11085823,D. R. Deekshith; P. V. M.

Blockchain Integration for Enhanced Document Security and Access Control,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Traditional document management solutions frequently exhibit centralised vulnerabilities, insufficient auditability, and restricted control over access rights, hence presenting considerable dangers in the administration of sensitive digital documents. This study tackles these issues by offering a blockchain-based system for secure document storage and dynamic access management. The design utilises Ethereum smart contracts, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for offchain storage, and Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) for user identification. Access control mechanisms are executed by RoleBased and Attribute-Based rules integrated directly into the blockchain via smart contracts. The solution underwent evaluation using a synthetic dataset of 1,000 access requests, demonstrating exceptional performance: 98.4% access accuracy, 92.6 % storage efficiency, and an average latency of 1.8 seconds, surpassing current methodologies including centralised RBAC and hybrid cloud systems. The suggested system guarantees immutability, transparency, and decentralisation in the management of digital documents, in comparison with previous models. The findings validate the model's resilience and scalability for use in domains such as healthcare, law, and government. Future research could explore AI-augmented decision-making and biometric integrations.

To comply with the regulations, the Indonesian government has mandated the use of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology, implemented as a chip injected under the scales of the Super Red Arowana, for tagging and certification. However, an issue persists where some individuals create counterfeit certificates. This paper introduces a beneficial application of blockchain technology combined with RFID chips to address the risks of certificate forgery, ensuring the authenticity and traceability of high-value ornamental fish, specifically Arowana. By leveraging RFID tags for physical identification and Ethereum-based smart contracts for ensuring data integrity, the proposed system establishes a secure and immutable record of ownership, lineage, and transaction history. This solution addresses critical challenges in verifying the authenticity and provenance of wildlife, particularly endangered and rare species, while enabling transparency in peer-to-peer trading and supporting conservation efforts. The project integrates on-chain storage for lineage tracking, linking fish RFID tags concepts to their digital representations as NFTs, and compare it with current system. Smart contracts automate essential processes such as NFT minting, pricing, and secure ownership transfers, effectively mitigating fraud risks. Furthermore, this system provides a proof-of-concept for how blockchain technology can enhance record-keeping and combat wildlife trafficking.

Development of an Equivalency Checker Application using Blockchain and Machine Learning Approach,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9180891180590482,"The AI-Based Equivalency Checker represents an advanced automated system which performs academic credential evaluation and verification between different international educational standards. Artificial intelligence (AI) with machine learning (ML) technologies allows evaluation processes to become more efficient when determining equivalent values between international educational degrees and local ones. The system performs three main functions to verify academic records through two data sources. It first analyses academic files users submit to the system before comparing the documents against a standardised format in its global educational database. Subsequently it creates an equivalent qualification map. NLP methods assist the system in interpreting document contents before performing exact information analysis. A system security improvement becomes possible because verified credentials cannot be modified through blockchain technology implementing an immutable digital ledger. Universities, employers, and government agencies can view complete equivalency reports via an API platform. This method leads to substantially improved academic credential evaluation performance while ensuring better accuracy and security in addition to shorter processing times for lessening the possibility of qualification fraud. The developed systems help improve the verification process for academic credentials across the globe. The NSDC, along with AIU, constructed a technology-based academic and skill qualification verification system that operates in India. The NAD National Academic Depository initiative provides both global recognition for Indian qualifications and decreases fraudulent activities in the education system.

Managing Access Control for AI APIs via Blockchain Smart Contracts,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6934554581125922,"AI has already begun to lead transformation across industries, along with AI APIs such as predictive modeling and Natural Language Processing. Just like them, AI applications are on the rise as well. Unfortunately, those typically operate under the hackneyed idea of having a universal centralized access control entity, which are not only prone to security breaches, rather they lack efficiency and access transparency as well. Consequently, this hinders attempts made to secure sensitive data and enforce accountability in AI systems. This paper proposes a new system model based on blockchain technology and smart contracts and discusses how it manages access control to AI APIs. This solution tackles the limitations of conventional systems such as security, scalability, and transparency brought by decomposing access rights. There are different possibilities for monitoring and enforcing security policies, One of them, Dynamic access control prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to any resource. In addition, blockchain guarantees auditing by virtue of its decentralized nature, eliminating reliance on central entities. The proposed approach is substantiated through a combination of simulations alongside proof-of-concept implementations, demonstrating the ability to decrease access latency, enhance resistance to rogue access attempts and access management processes. This work increasingly enhances the decentralized security solutions available by providing an effective solution for access control in the context of centralized AI API’s for both enterprise and government use cases being scalable and robust as well as transparent.",10.1109/IRASET64571.2025.11008265,S.

Blockchain-Assisted Secure Smart Home Network Using Gradient-Based Optimizer With Hybrid Deep Learning Model,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.800833506721655,"The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a technology enabler to enhance the urban physical architecture and render public services. But, public access to accumulated heterogeneous IoT urban information is prone to hackers attacking connected devices to the internet intellectual property as well. IoT security serves a dynamic part in the smart city. Some IoT devices are connected in smart homes, and these connections were centred on gateways. In smart homes, the gateways gain a lot of significance; but their centralized structure causes many security vulnerabilities like availability, integrity, and certification. Unified “cloud-like” computing networks and Blockchain (BC) type systems should be used to sort out these problems. Therefore, this article develops a Blockchain-Assisted Secure Smart Home Network using Gradient Based Optimizer with Hybrid Deep Learning (BSSHN-GBOHDL) model. The presented BSSHN-GBOHDL technique employs BC technology to improve the confidentiality of the data in the smart home environment. In addition, the BSSHN-GBOHDL technique identifies malicious activities in the smart home environment via three sub-processes namely data preprocessing, hybrid deep learning (HDL)-based malicious activity classification, and GBO-based hyperparameter tuning. The GBO algorithm assists in the proficient hyperparameter selection of the HDL model, which aids in accomplishing increased detection efficiency. The experimental validation of the BSSHN-GBOHDL approach is tested on a benchmark NSL-KDD dataset with 65495 normal and 60743 attack samples.

Today's conventional perimeter-based systems use credential- based authentication (e.g., username/password, certificates, etc.) to decide whether an actor can access a network. However, the verification process occurs only at the system's perimeter because most IoT devices lack robust security measures due to their limited hardware and software capabilities, making them highly vulnerable. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach based on Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) extended with blockchain to further enhance security. The blockchain component serves as an immutable database for storing users' requests and is used to verify trustworthiness by analyzing and identifying potentially malicious user activities.

The report discusses two uses of IoT with Blockchain as examples for the industry with many other possibilities being adoptable in a proposed single architecture that would integrate industry procedures to a common platform. While identifying technological improvements to the industry the paper also identifies the practical aspects of such a development, with varying interests across the sector, restricted funds and advancing computing power all being significant factors in whether and how to invest in such technologies. With reference to other industry attempts to make improved decisions from IoT technologies, the necessity for industry representation and leadership is seen as a significant factor in the success of any large-scale industry-wide development of a size where significant industry improvements would be achieved. While small scale isolated projects can assist individual institutions the savings industry-wide from these is likely to be much less significant than a single platform addressing total industry issues, however, the complexity in achieving this is not to be underestimated. A government body or the healthcare industry, is potentially required to coordinate the design and implementation, compiling the scope and design documentation with funding and development/implementation being provided for the industry as a whole.

Such an EHR system would also facilitate researchers, doctors, and government authorities to access data for research, perform analytics, and help in making well-informed decisions. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed to classify the patients as potentially COVID-19 positive and potentially COVID-19 negative based on the clinical reports and reports of CT-scan. The data of potentially COVID-19 positive patients is stored on blockchain employing InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol. The accessibility of EHR can be done by authorized entities post verification and validation of entities. We analyze the performance of various AI-based algorithms employing metrics such as loss curve, accuracy, etc. for the task of predicting the patient’s potential COVID-19 infection.

In Taiwan, the whole country was in an uproar when several food security scandals broke out in 2011. Since then, people have increased distrust of the resume, the certificates, and the testing reports of the food, as well as the government's functionality of supervising food safety. Therefore, constructing a reliable food traceability system under the distrust becomes the main purpose of this paper, and the characteristics of blockchain technology are happen to be able to eliminate the dependence on the trust of these centralized third-party. In this thesis, we target on two aspects of food traceability: the environment in which the ingredients of the food are sourced, and the logistics and shipping environment through which the food supply chain passes. The source environment of the ingredients part is based on the accurate environmental data collected by the IoT sensors deployed at the farm, as well as the various certificates or testing report of the farms. As for the logistics shipping environment, is also based on the data collected by the IoT sensor deployed in the vehicle. Supported by blockchain technology, with its characteristics, it provides verification for these data under the distrust of both parties. At last, our system supports e-commerce service.

Blockchain-based Digital Locker using BigchainDB and InterPlanetary File System,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Our identity as a human being is determined by the documents, not by appearance or physicality. The most important thing to prove the identity of humans is to show a government-issued document. Generally, from birth to death humans are recognized by documents because they are born with a birth certificate and they die with a death certificate. The main problem with these documents is that, they can be falsified or manipulated by others. Moreover in this digital era, they are stored in a centralized manner, which is prone to a cyber threat. This study aims to develop a blockchain environment to create, verify, and securely share documents in a decentralized manner. With the help of bigchainDB, interplanetary file system (IPFS), and asymmetric encryption, this research work will prototype the proposed solution called blockchain-based digital locker, which is similar to the DigiLocker released by the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY), Govt. of India.

Data Centric DAO: When blockchain reigns over the Cloud,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7012844279938241,"Nowadays, data has become more and more important. Most governments have passed laws to control how they are owned and used, such as the GDPR in Europe. However, any law is never perfect. We can see it when a company scattered around the world is hampered by the fact of not being able to exploit customer data outside the borders of a territory. Also, we can add that a data owner is not anymore once he sells them to a third party to be exploited. In this work, we propose a solution based on a permissioned blockchain, namely the Hyperledger Fabric, to allow any stakeholder with data to take part, with value providers, in creating Decentralized Autonomous organizations (DAOs). Once created, a DAO can attract other investors to expand it. The Hyperledger Fabric handles this whole process through channels. The infrastructure needed to run the business of the DAO is generated automatically through special transactions taking place at the blockchain level. In the opposite direction, the cloud infrastructure sends notifications to the Hyperledger for traceability and monitoring purposes. Finally, through simulations of wealth distribution models, we show that to keep control of a DAO based on the proposed architecture, the shares must be negotiated according to a Pareto law.",10.1109/IEMTRONICS55184.2022.9795753,I.

The blockchain-based trading platform allows secure and transparent P2P energy trading in a grid-connected power network. In the P2P network, a participant with a surplus of renewable energy (such as solar photovoltaic (PV)) can trade excess with any other participants with an energy deficit. However, in business-as-usual (BAU), it has been fed back to the power grid or curtailed - which can be extremely costly to the grid. The energy traded through solar PV and battery energy storage system (BESS) via P2P trading is cheaper than the respective tariff of the grid.The main aim of the LEM is to mitigate power outages and accelerate the transition to clean energy through increased rooftop solar PV installation by motivating consumers and prosumers to invest in DERs. The LEM implements a marketplace for optimizing distributed energy resources (DERs). In doing so, the LEM can minimize lost energy from existing DER capacity, provide a financial incentive to generate renewable energy beyond the site it is generated at, and improve the savings and profits compared to a BAU case. Simplified, a LEM provides participants with cheaper, greener, and more reliable energy. The LEM maximizes a participant's yield from their solar PV panels, increasing the investment's profitability.Due to the benefits provided, implementing LEM accelerates renewable energy deployment with no government incentives.

Governments are doing their best for providing the best healthcare services to their citizens. The nation's economy also depends upon the people's health. Nowadays, we are in the era of healthcare 4.0 and there is a big difference in healthcare services compared to healthcare 1.0. In healthcare 4.0, everything is digitized and patient records are stored as electronic health records (EHRs). Any breach in EHRs can put the patient's life at risk as it contains whole information about the patient (including historical background). Thus, researchers offer security to the EHR data exchange using traditional cryptographic techniques. Unfortunately, it can be easily broken using quantum computing. So, this needs a multi-layer encryption algorithm, which makes the system highly secure and anonymous. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a blockchain and onion routing-based secure, trusted, resilient, and immutable framework for offering security and anonymity to the healthcare data exchange. Here, onion routing offers anonymity and blockchain offers decentralization, immutability, trust, diversity, and security.

A Blockchain-Based Approach to Streamlining Land Registration using Hyperledger Fabric,2023,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,0.8371096325363274,"A broker creates a connection between the buyer and seller under India's traditional land registration system. For instance, the broker would compile and gather all essential physical paperwork that serves as evidence of the transaction if someone wanted to buy or sell a piece of land. Brokers ensure that the land or property is registered with a legitimate government institution, where all the information is entered in a ledger, and that the full transaction is finalized after which, a sale is made between the two parties. Since anyone with the necessary access rights can readily view or change the papers in this situation, there is a chance that the important documents will be lost or tampered with, thereby endangering the tangible proof of ownership. The process is still largely physical with less digitization and as a result, this sort of system is slow, insecure, and unorganized. In this traditional method, the risk of corruption and fraud during the execution of the necessary transaction is also high. Hence, a new system has been proposed which uses smart contracts to handle transactions of assets among the participants in the network. It has been proposed to implement a permissioned blockchain-based land registration system on Hyperledger Fabric, which enables a decentralised, transparent, and secure way to conduct transactions between the parties.

Elections are crucial components of democratic systems, and it is essential to guarantee transparent, secure, and impartial election processes to maintain citizens’ trust in the government. However, the lack of transparency and security in democratic elections has raised concerns about their legitimacy and fairness. Creating a secure e-voting system that provides fairness, anonymity, transparency, and flexibility has been a significant challenge, despite the increasing adoption of technology worldwide. Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) offer time and effort-saving benefits compared to traditional paper ballots but are susceptible to challenges that compromise the integrity of the electoral process. To address these challenges, we have proposed a Blockchain based E-voting system. This system provides a secure, decentralized platform where votes are recorded on an immutable ledger. It enables real-time vote counting, overcoming the time-consuming and error-prone nature of traditional methods. The proposed approach involves using Hyperledger Fabric and Chaincode to develop a scalable, maintainable, and cost-effective e-voting system within a customized private Blockchain network. This system adheres to the principles of Zero Knowledge Proof, ensuring accurate vote accounting and safeguarding the credibility and legitimacy of democratic elections.",10.1109/OCIT59427.2023.10431056,C.

A Role-Based Access Control Management Model on Blockchain for Restricted Facilities: An Airport Example,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6968680047636491,"Since numerous firms and governments are in dire need of safeguarding their premises, the confidentiality of data is of utmost importance in achieving this goal. The security of facility entry is crucial, but it's also crucial for future demands that the entrance logs are auditable. Due to these reasons, restricted locations require access control and round-the-clock management. A centralized approach for administering grants and monitoring access is a simple choice as it is among the most frequently employed ones. In this respect, airports are deemed as being one of the safest places since every airport provides certain public and security services and accession to these restricted facilities must be controlled and authorized by the airport management organization. Unchangeable, auditable and always-available access records and open management in accordance with its confidentiality necessities are all answers to the issues experienced in the sector with regard to access control. In this work, a role-based access control strategy for regulating airport entrances that are scattered and require government oversight is presented and implemented using the Ethereum blockchain.

IPFS-Blockchain Based Technology for Lease Agreement and Rental System in Real Estate,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.75966741153766,"Rental and lease scams are becoming more common in India by the use of a rental property as a lure to obtain money from the landlord or prospective tenants. Unfortunately, these scams seek to extort money from prospective renters or the tenants by fake real estate agents and fake listings or by breaching the lease agreement, breach in rent payment and hiding the utility bill charges. These scams can occur with both, the tenant or the renter as the victim. The government also faces difficulty in monitoring and keeping track of the property tax. This paper proposes the adoption of blockchain technology to address this issue by creating a housing lease alliance chain through Smart Contracts which enables landlords and tenants to sign lease agreements, to incorporate utility bills while signing the contract and to automatically pay and collect rent on a regular basis.

On top of the quantum random walker, we apply the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol to avoid the double spending problem and to serve as a seed provider for the quantum walk. We further design the key chain update protocol with the help of MALE mechanism after each data access. Both QKD and quantum random walker can be efficiently simulated with current classical computation and near-term quantum technologies.

Transaction Immutability and Reputation Traceability: Blockchain as a Platform for Access Controlled IoT and Human Interactivity,2017,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8382909818134123,"Credible reputation lies at the core of users and devices communicating and transacting successfully. Identity fraud is becoming increasingly difficult to manage in the face of massive-scale database breaches. In critical infrastructure and public safety applications, as well as day-to-day personal and business transactions, it is imperative to have a significant degree of confidence in whom/what one communicates with - whether to know if the recipient can be entrusted with the sender's data, or if the sender's data is to be considered reliably sourced. Even where possible, lost reputation is substantially more cumbersome, timeconsuming and expensive to replace than are compromised, stolen or defective devices and their embedded cryptographic keys. This paper focuses on two methodologies that have considerable implications relative to addressing the reputation issue: (1) blockchain-enabled anomaly detection and assessment that involves dynamically asserted identity at the network edge effected through end-user targeted release of trusted behavioral data; (2) IoT and human interaction that is securely facilitated through use of an ""Inviter-Invitee"" protocol to set up dedicated maintainable ""communication lines.""

Bitcoin introduced an ""eventual consistency"" blockchain with the apparent intent of providing an open and inclusive system for secure, anonymous, yet cost-effective financial transactions based on peer-to-peer computing. It uses Proof ofWork as a cryptographic puzzle to control growth of a chain and to strengthen the resiliency of a chain against subsequent rewrite attempts. Commercial sectors and the public sector have realized the potential of this technical approach, and we now see a number of blockchains that may be called private, closed or permissioned - and that may eschew the values inherent in the design of Bitcoin type systems. From a value-neutral research perspective, there are no clear definitions of blockchain attributes such as ""private"" or ""permissioned"", nor is there typically a good understanding of the trust assumptions that clients must make when using such services - for example in systems that do not rely on Proof of Work but on a limited and controlled set of consensus-creating agents.

Numerous approaches are proposed for monitoring the looseness of bolted joint assemblies, however, the majority of them can only be used for looseness detection purposes and not viable for monitoring since these approaches contain design impracticalities, not scalable or hard to implement outside of the laboratory environment. Furthermore, remote unattended monitoring is still very much in its infancy. Thus, to solve this issue, we propose a TenSense M20, a custom designed smart sensor node for continuous remote SHM of bolted joints. Complete node design is presented. Each aspect of the design is evaluated both by simulation and practical tests. Long Range (LoRa) is used as a means of wireless communication and the network can cover 3.8 km. The results show that TenSense M20 is able to precisely track the pre-tension force of a bolted joint with the approach being robust and scalable. Several transmission scenarios are analyzed and in the worst case scenario the node is estimated to last more than 5 years powered by several LiSOCl2 primary batteries.

This paper proposed an advanced system for ANPR that can move away from the traditional booth and establish a checkpoint. The strategically located cameras with checkpointing will automatically capture the plates of passing vehicles, permitting road tax and parking fees to be deducted without making contact. A hybrid approach that combines the capabilities of OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, and deep-learningbased OCR models helps tackle such challenges as stable images from live video feeds and highly accurate text recognition. To this end, since the system integrates high-resolution frame stabilization using OpenCV to ensure crystal clear captures, it further employs the use of YOLOv8 to boost the precision of real-time detection. The blockchain technology is further implemented to ensure that transactions are tamper proof, therefore ensuring secure and transparent billing systems.

However, few people are willing to reflect or report some violations of law and discipline around them, and more people choose to ignore. In general, there are two major reasons for this phenomenon. First, reporting with a real name is highly recommended, but it is difficult to send trusted and reliable reporting messages without revealing the reporter's identity. Second, generally no benefit, users usually lack the motivation to report due to worrying about being retaliated. In this paper, we propose an effective anonymous reporting system called ReportCoin, a novel Blockchain-based incentive anonymous reporting system. ReportCoin guarantees user identity privacy and reporting message reliability throughout the reporting process. On the one hand, ReportCoin allows nondeterministic mobile users to vote the reporting by signing and to send anonymous announcements in the non-fully trusted network. On the other hand, ReportCoin motivates users with incentives to report without worrying about the disclosure of identity information to be retaliated.

Two-Tier PKI network for Implementing e-Certificates Service in Indonesia,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8551828086577414,"Although the concept and technology of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) were introduced over 50 years ago, there are still relatively few successful large-scale public service applications where citizens widely and conveniently use PKI-based systems. Similarly, since the emergence of blockchain technology in the 2010s, over a thousand academic papers have proposed applying blockchain’s transparency and immutability to public sector services. While some small-scale prototype systems have been developed, large-scale implementations that are actively used by citizens remain rare. One of the biggest obstacles to the widespread adoption of PKI and blockchain systems is the requirement for strong personal identification, such as a government-issued ID, in order to issue a PKI certificate. Moreover, users must securely manage their digital certificates to prevent loss or unauthorized duplication, which imposes an additional security and usability burden. The eCert24 system addresses this issue by adopting a two-tier model in which only the eCert24 service provider and the certificate issuer hold PKI certificates. Meanwhile, users are required to undergo strict authentication processes only when requesting or receiving certificates.

However, there are security-specific challenges with the authentication of drones while airborne. The current authentication approaches, in most drone-based applications, are subject to latency issues in real time with security vulnerabilities for attacks. To address such issues, we introduce a secure authentication model with low latency for drones in smart cities that looks to leverage blockchain technology. We apply a zone-based architecture in a network of drones, and use a customized decentralized consensus, known as drone-based delegated proof of stake (DDPOS), for drones among zones in a smart city that does not require reauthentication. The proposed architecture aims for positive impacts on increased security and reduced latency on the Internet of Drones (IoD). Moreover, we provide an empirical analysis of the proposed architecture compared to other peer models previously proposed for IoD to demonstrate its performance and security authentication capability.

Moreover, with the rapid increase of IIoT devices, a large amount of data is swapped between heterogeneous sensors and devices every moment. This trend increases the risk of eavesdropping and hijacking attacks in communication channels, so maintaining data privacy and security becomes two notable concerns at present. Recently, based on the mechanism of the Schnorr signature, a more secure and lightweight certificateless signature (CLS) protocol is popular for the resource-constrained IIoT protocol design. Nevertheless, we found most of the existing CLS schemes are susceptible to several common security weaknesses such as man-in-the-middle attacks, key generation center compromised attacks, and distributed denial of service attacks. To tackle the challenges mentioned previously, in this article, we propose a novel pairing-free certificateless scheme that utilizes the state-of-the-art blockchain technique and smart contract to construct a novel reliable and efficient CLS scheme. Then, we simulate the Type-I and Type-II adversaries to verify the trustworthiness of our scheme.

Blockchain and Anomaly Detection based Monitoring System for Enforcing Wastewater Reuse,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7520526671878149,"Industries, household communities consume a lot of water on regular basis, thereby increasing water crisis. There is continuous increase in water consumption by industries. Reusing wastewater can reduce water withdrawals from local water sources thus increasing water availability, lowering wastewater discharges and their pollutant load, reducing thermal energy consumption and, potentially, processing cost. Various ways have been implemented for recycling the generated wastewater. Wastewater must be reused for the benefit of mankind. In this paper we propose a wastewater recycle control system to efficiently manage the wastewater and coordinate it among the industries and the government. Blockchain technology has been deployed for storing data and developing an incentive model to encourage wastewater reuse. Tokens are provided to industries in proportion to quantity and quality of reused wastewater. Rules for issue and trade of these tokens are written as a smart contract. Unfortunately, providing such incentives also provides a motive for tampering the data on which these tokens are awarded. Anomaly detection algorithms are used to detect the potential frauds which take place in the system upon IoT meter data tampering. The system uses IoT meters that measure volume of wastewater generated and reused, along with quality metrics such as pH, hardness and oil content. Multiple machine learning algorithms are used to detect tampering- polynomial regression, DBSCAN, autoencoders and LSTM networks. Their performance has then been compared. A first implementation of this system and an evaluation of the system's performance are also presented.",10.1109/ICCCNT45670.2019.8944586,S. Iyer; S. Thakur; M. Dixit; R. Katkam; A. Agrawal; F. Kazi

TOTEM SDK: an open toolset for token controlled computation managed by blockchain,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6354980875552796,"As a part of using the Internet, surging over the past decade, a wide range of data has been generated at a breakneck pace from various sources such as social media, banking sectors and governments. Many organizations have changed their work culture and adopted Big Data analytic to gain various benefits from the data being produced. Nevertheless, sharing this big data was always a tremendous challenge for scientists and engineers as it involves a large volume and sensitive data, which cannot be handled by the conventional way of data analysis. TOTEM: Token for controlled computation, accounts for an innovative concept that integrates both blockchain technologies and big data systems and uses their advantages to present a better, secure and more cost-effective solution for both data owners and data consumers. The TOTEM architecture (US Patent No.: US11,121,874 B2) aims to overcome security and privacy breaches and prevent moving large data sets across the network for analysis. Totem is an entity used in TOTEM architecture for putting constraints on computational operations. Authorised users in the network are allowed to write their own code in a specific format through a TOTEM defined SDK for analysing the data provided by the data owner. The SDK, along with the deployed smart contracts in the network, form a pre monitoring system that keeps track of totem entity value associated with each users’ submitted codes using an estimator table. In this article, we will focus on the layers of this TOTEM defined SDK and further explain how the SDK interacts with the code, analyze it within the layers and finally how it responds to it.",10.1109/CSDE53843.2021.9718489,B.

Deep Learning-Based Blockchain Framework for the COVID-19 Spread Monitoring,2021,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,1.0,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the worldwide health and economy eco-system and remains one of the key global disturbances even in the presence. A promising solution partially suppressing the fast COVID spread in the dense areas is the digital contact tracing of the infected persons and those who they encounter. Digital contact tracing is an effective solution, whilst few notable drawbacks must be addressed. In general, we are facing both, technological and legal issues, when reconstructing the precise trajectories of the infected persons. The former one stems from the fact that there is commonly a need for personal intervention (specific application, GPS locator, Bluetooth), the latter one deals with the legal aspects of revealing the personal information to the governments/3rd parties. Technological limitations (battery draining, loss of GPS signal, etc.) limits the accuracy of trajectories, especially in dense urban areas. In this paper, we use the autonomous machine learning framework based on the application of the generative adversarial networks (GAN) that is capable of accurate reconstruction of the person trajectories identifying as far as 20% more contacts. Later, this specific person-sensitive information is processed in the private operators' database and blockchain platform is used to securely store healthiness information.

FDataCollector: A Blockchain Based Friendly Web Data Collection System,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6568282620479808,"In the last decade, a growing number of people use web crawlers to collect the data from the Internet for data analysis. The web crawlers greatly increase the workload of web servers and hence hinder normal accesses of the websites located in the servers. The accesses from web crawlers also affect the effectiveness of web mining, which assumes that the accesses are all from normal users. Moreover, the un-licensed collection of data from websites are often prohibited by laws and regulations of government and commercial organizations. To restrict the data collection from web crawlers, currently anti-crawler technique is applied to the websites. The behaviors of web crawler are recognized and their accesses are denied. This overcome the aforementioned problem, however, become a big obstacle for data exchange, considering that the large volume of data in the Internet could be useful for many data analysis applications. The dilemma of data collection using web crawlers and anti-crawler techniques demand a better solution. In this study, we propose to a friendly data sharing system FDataCollector to allow the data collection and also alleviate the workload of web servers by using blockchain techniques. We first make the data uploaded to the data sharing system by a few trustful users and then sell to public users in a traceable and P2P sharing way. The other accesses of web web crawlers are prohibited. On the user side, this design not only enable a convenient search of data but also improve the download efficiency. On the data holder side, this traceable and benefit way encourages them to share the data. We implement the system to demonstrate our idea. The results show that the system has high efficiency even when many transactions occur at the same time.",10.1109/MSN53354.2021.00115,J. Wang; W. Zhu; J. Lai; Z. Wang

VaCoChain: Blockchain-Based 5G-Assisted UAV Vaccine Distribution Scheme for Future Pandemics,2022,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.8838783908440782,"This paper proposes a generic scheme VaCoChain, that fuses blockchain (BC) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) underlying fifth-generation (5G) communication services for timely vaccine distribution during novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and future pandemics. The scheme offers 5G-tactile internet (5G-TI) based services for UAV communication networks (UAVCN) monitored through ground controller stations (GCs). 5G-TI enabled UAVCN supports real-time dense connectivity at ultra-low round-trip time (RTT) latency of $< \text{1 ms}$ and high availability of 99.99999%. Thus, it can support resilient vaccine distributions in a phased manner at government-designated nodal centers (NCs) with reduced round trip delays from vaccine production warehouses (VPW). Further, UAVCNs ensure minimizes human intervention and controls vaccine health conditions due to shorter trip times. Once vaccines are supplied at NCs warehouses, then the BC ensures timestamped documentation of vaccinated persons with chronology, auditability, and transparency of supply-chain checkpoints from VPW to NCs. Through smart contracts (SCs), priority groups can be formed for vaccination based on age, healthcare workers, and general commodities. In the simulation, for UAV efficacy, we have compared the scheme against fourth-generation (4G)-assisted long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, and traditional logistics for round-trip time (RTT) latency, logistics, and communication costs. In the BC setup, we have compared the scheme against the existing 5G-TI delivery scheme (Gupta et al.) for processing latency, packet losses, and transaction time. For example, in communication costs, the proposed scheme achieves an average improvement of 9.13 for block meta-information. For 4000 transactions, the proposed scheme has a communication latency of 16 s compared to 36 s. The packet loss is significantly reduced to 2.5% using 5G-TI compared to 16% in 4G-LTE-A. The proposed scheme has a computation cost of 1.6 ms and a communication cost of 157 bytes, which indicates the scheme efficacy against conventional approaches.",10.1109/JBHI.2021.3103404,A.

Smart Solutions using Blockchain-Powered Property Booking System,2025,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,1.0,"In the traditional land and house registration system in India, brokers play a central role in facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers. These intermediaries handle the creation and assembly of physical documents required to establish ownership and agreements. Once the necessary paperwork is completed, the broker ensures the registration of the property at an authorized government office, where the transaction details are manually recorded in a ledger. However, this process is fraught with challenges, including the risk of document loss, tampering, or unauthorized alterations, as physical records can be easily accessed or manipulated by individuals with influence or power. Such vulnerabilities compromise the integrity of property ownership and create opportunities for corruption and fraud. In contrast, the proposed system leverages smart contracts and the Hyperledger framework to create a more secure, transparent, and decentralized alternative. Smart contracts automate the transaction process, ensuring that all terms are enforced without the need for intermediaries, while the Hyperledger framework ensures immutability and synchronization of records across a decentralized network. This innovative approach eliminates manual inefficiencies, enhances security, and reduces opportunities for fraud by providing a tamper-proof system. Furthermore, the transparency and portability offered by the proposed solution install greater trust among participants, making it a robust alternative to traditional methods. By combining these advanced technologies, the system addresses critical weaknesses in the traditional approach and sets a new standard for property registration processes. The proposed system uses smart contracts and the Hyperledger framework to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized property registration solution. Smart contracts automate transactions, removing the need for intermediaries, while Hyperledger ensures tamper-proof records and synchronized data across a decentralized network. This eliminates inefficiencies, enhances security, reduces fraud, and builds trust among participants, offering a modern, reliable alternative to traditional registration methods.",10.1109/ICCMC65190.2025.11140836,R.

The Evolution of Mining Pools and Miners’ Behaviors in the Bitcoin Blockchain,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9191889494643827,"We analyzed 23 mining pools and explore the mobility of miners throughout Bitcoin’s history. Mining pools have emerged as major players to ensure that the Bitcoin system stays secure, valid, and stable. Many questions remain open regarding how mining pools have evolved throughout Bitcoin’s history and when and why miners join or leave the pools. We investigated the reward payout flow of mining pools and characterized them based on payout irregularity and structural complexity. Based on our proposed algorithm, we identified miners and studied their mobility in the pools over time. Our analysis shows that Bitcoin mining is an industry that is sensitive to external events (e.g., market price and government policy). Over time, competition between pools involving reward schemes and pool fees motivated miners to migrate between pools (i.e., pool hopping and cross pooling). These factors converged toward optimal scheme and values, which made mining activities more stable.",10.1109/TNSM.2022.3159004,N. Tovanich; N. Soulié; N. Heulot; P. Isenberg

Block chain Based Framework for Document Verification,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Document Verification using Blockchain Technology has a huge scope. With increasing documents generated every year, there is no systematic and simple way to verify the documents. This system could be used to the governments, organizations, employers and basically anybody who wants to verify that the given document is not forged. This could be used to verify all kinds of immutable records ranging from attendance records, birth certificates, graduation and academic credentials. The proposed system could be used by the government to construct a decentralized network to store and maintain record. This is also the best way to ensure that the documents exist in the state of their creation, that they are not tampered with by anyone. Motivated by this, we propose to develop a decentralized blockchain system using Ethereum that will serve as an application to authenticate the documents. An application will be installed to local systems in which the users will verify the documents. These local systems also known as “Nodes” or “Blocks”.Once the documents are added to blocks forming the blockchain, complex calculations are performed to find the unique hash for that particular document.This concept can be implemented through decentralized applications deployed on the blockchain. The blockchain that is intended to be used for the deployment process is the Ropsten Ethereum Network.

Land Registry Management using Blockachain,2020,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,0.8234224864532816,"Land Registration is a use case which involves lot of middlemen and central authorities in the process which then puts trust in the system. Keeping traces of who owns which part of land is challenging when there are hundreds or thousands of land records to maintain. Using Blockchain will remove the middlemen in the system and also will reduce corruption and increase speed of the process. Land Registration is a simple decentralized application which is build using the Ethereum Blockchain principals. We can use this registration procedure as an substitute to bypass the existing system flaws. Here the user who owns the land registers his land details and also enters market value of the land by providing all the necessary proofs. A government authority who traditionally looks into land registry is assigned as a super admin can do the registration process. Lands coming under a particular village can be registered to the system only through the super admin who is assigned to that village. The smart contract used here is written in such a way that the owner has to transfer his property completely to the buyer and no transaction of the land can be partial. Even we allow a government authority is involved in registration process, the entire process is transparent and the transaction happens only between the two clients.",10.1109/ICSIDEMPC49020.2020.9299614,A.

Participatory AI: Reducing AI Bias and Developing Socially Responsible AI in Smart Cities,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9205422760474704,"As smart cities evolve, artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be used to manage decisions for how cities operate. For everything from incarceration sentencing, city pension appropriation, surveillance and infrastructure management, AI will play a role. The author argues that implementing AI for a smart city should be decided similarly to how cities decide on major infrastructural planning projects. For both, there are social and ethical implications of deployment. A protocol is proposed for smart city AI so that AI can be seen as an ethical and trustworthy city asset rather than an adversary fraught with controversy and bias. This is achieved through participatory AI - the marriage of a fully transparent data architecture, such as the blockchain, and the urban planning practice of participatory planning.

Land Administration System using Hyperledger Fabric,2022,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,1.0,"The land administration system in various developing countries like India addresses issues like insufficient, fraudulent, or misrepresented data. As the system consists of an intermediary between seller and buyer, generally known as a broker, this middle man makes arrangements for the required physical documents needed for the agreement as proof of property. The broker ensures that all attributes related to the property are noted down and registered by the authorized government office. The records are stored in various departments according to the land administration system, this makes the process timeconsuming, unsynchronized, and easily immune to tampering of data. Due to this, there remains no accountability to manage the information’s authenticity which also leads to incomplete verification. This paper aims to develop a land administration system using blockchain that helps to increase transparency and maintain the integrity of the system, making sure that all the transactions in the network are endorsed by all the peers involved. As blockchain is immutable, the history of records cannot be changed as records get permanently linked to the network, thereby streamlining documentation and record-keeping.

A Study in Understanding the Major Factors influencing the Investment Decision Making in Cryptocurrency Markets by Gen Z and Millennials,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9382713310199499,"As a method of exchange, cryptocurrency, which is a digital version of money made possible by a system called “blockchain technology,” functions very similarly to the fiat currency that it is based on. A cryptocurrency is also referred to as payment tokens, crypto tokens, electronic money, cyber money, virtual products, and virtual assets. These are all different names for the same thing. Because of the proliferation of cryptocurrency usage, it is now feasible to engage in direct monetary transactions, so sidestepping the need for conventional monetary authorities such as banks and governments to be involved. Bitcoin was the first kind of digital currency that existed only in the online world. This is the ultimate effect of dispersing operating expenses, which is a common strategy used by financial organizations in order to maximize their revenues. Cryptography is a tried-and-tested method that may be used to protect sensitive information from being seen by unauthorized parties. When sending data via a secure encryption method, the information must first be encrypted. The name given to the decentralized peer-to-peer network that Bitcoin uses is “blockchain.” The primary objective of this change is to make it more difficult to spend money twice. The fact that neither the server nor the administration is centralized lends credence to the theory that the system in question is decentralized. Only businesses and members of the general public are able to independently validate the value of these currencies. The basic objective of the paper is to understand the major factors influencing the investment decision making in cryptocurrency markets by Gen Z and millennials. A well-structured questionnaire used for collection and convenience sampling is utilized rather commonly for the purpose of participant selection since, in comparison to other methods from a11152 participants. Despite all of the fuss, bitcoin may still be used today for genuine online transactions of items and services. Cryptocurrencies are a game-changer because they represent a significant divergence from the existing system of centralised and tightly regulated financial institutions. While professionals are responsible for the development, administration, and assessment of traditional financial reports. It’s possible that the proliferation of blockchain’s usage is to blame for the growth in transactions using digital currencies. Adding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to your investment portfolio could be a smart move if you’re wanting to broaden its scope. There are numerous similarities between the market for cryptocurrencies and markets for other types of financial assets, and certain cryptocurrencies are becoming more often utilized as payment methods..",10.1109/IC3I56241.2022.10073371,B.

FinBlock: Secure and Fast Transaction Confirmation with High Throughput for FinTech Application,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.492442047065954,"Finance is the backbone of any organization or government. The government's financial health relies heavily on managing its FinTech applications. In the current FinTech system, user financial information is stored centrally. In the centralized system, the information security risks are high. Thus, a decentralized system is required for better security, trust and safety management in the FinTech information system. Blockchain is a decentralized technology that can solve the issues of traditional FinTech applications like banking. In the blockchain, consensus protocols are responsible for maintaining a consistent copy of the blockchain at each node of the blockchain network. However, these protocols are not suitable for regular currency transactions due to high latency and low throughput. Therefore, to achieve reliability, low latency, and high throughput, we have introduced a new protocol called FinBlock. In FinBlock, the pipeline concept is introduced in blockchain to increase the transaction throughput. Additionally, the number of message broadcasts is also reduced, which further improves the latency. Moreover, FinBlock achieves a speedup of 3 with respect to traditional practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol. The result showed that FinBlock achieved better transaction processing time, transaction throughput, and message count than the traditional PBFT, even with hundreds of nodes in the network with reduced message complexity.",10.1109/WCNC57260.2024.10571189,L.

While a vast array of sensors and IoT devices will be deployed to meet the data requirements of a smart approach to public service delivery, any city's largest and most sophisticated sensor network takes the form of its citizens. As the ones who use the city's infrastructure and services 24/7, they are uniquely placed to report any issues. What stops most people from doing so is firstly the lack of a platform with the appropriate channels and secondly, the lack of immediate incentives - most of the time, an issue will be seen as someone else's job to address.To address these issues, the Vizsafe platform has been designed to mobilize the crowd and give them a reason to submit information that is in everyone's interests. Through the power of blockchain, these reports are stored on a decentralized ledger, and, utilizing smart contracts, SPOT tokens are used as incentive to people that upload incident reports, whether that is a potential security threat or faulty infrastructure. It's the slight nudge that makes `someone else's problem' into `my opportunity'.

Several such node selection policies have been proposed that facilitate the selection of an optimal node, minimizing delay and energy consumption. However, one crucial assumption of these schemes is that all the networked fog nodes are authorized part of the fog network. This assumption is not valid, especially in a cooperative fog computing environment like a smart city, where fog nodes of multiple applications cooperate to meet their latency and computation requirements. In this paper, we propose a secure task-offloading framework for a distributed fog computing environment based on smart-contracts on the blockchain.

Most of the current cross-chain mechanisms based on blockchain are notary mode and relay mode, which cannot be dynamically switched according to their respective organizations' trust degree, making it difficult to meet the requirements of cross-chain data access between blockchain systems in complex trust environments. Based on this issue, a cross-chain consensus model based on trust establishment is proposed. The scheme constructs a blockchain security trust model based on the network state, blockchain system security, node data consistency and malicious node rate during blockchain operations, combines fuzzy theory and probability distributions to determine the trust components of each system, and uses those trust components and their weights to determine the system's trust value. The cross-chain consensus scheme is designed based on this model, which can be flexibly switched between the notary model and the committee relay model to satisfy cross-chain interconnection and mutual access between systems with different trust relationships.

An Intelligent Tender Management System using Block Chain and IPFS,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8456741489966568,"Tenders must be included in the procurement process for companies and government organizations. The primary purpose of these bids is to get the products and services necessary to effectively complete operations. Poor management of these bids, on the other hand, might have serious financial consequences. Contractor favoritism, inadequate record-keeping systems, a lack of transparency, hacking, data manipulation, and other obstacles may be among these issues. Improper bid and contract management may cause substantial financial loses and harm to the organisation’s reputation. When deficient record-keeping practices result in the loss of critical information, it can be difficult to trace the progress of tenders and contracts and evaluate performance. Additionally, the possibility of hacking and data tampering can lead to the theft of sensitive information, resulting in financial losses and reputational harm.

RDI: Real Digital Identity Based on Decentralized PKI,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8100573226476494,"Establishing a digital identity plays a vital part in the digital era. It is crucial to authenticate and identify the users in order to perform online transactions securely. For example, internet banking applications normally require a user to present a digital identity, e.g., username and password, to allow users to perform online transactions. However, the username-password approach has several downsides, e.g., susceptible to the brute-force attack. Public key binding using Certificate Authority (CA) is another common alternative to provide digital identity. Yet, the public key approach has a serious drawback: all CAs in the browser/OS' CA list are treated equally, and consequently, all trusts on the certificates could be invalidated by compromising only a single root CA's private key. We propose a Real Digital Identity based approach, or RDI, on decentralized PKI scheme. The core idea relies on a combination of well-known parties (e.g., a bank, a government agency) to certify the identity, instead of relying on a single CA. These parties, collectively known as Trusted Source Certificate Authorities (TSCA), formed a network of CAs. The generated certificates are stored in the blockchain controlled by smart contract. RDI creates a digital identity that can be trusted based on the TSCAs' challenge/response and it is also robust against a single point of trust attack on traditional CAs.",10.1109/ICSEC.2018.8712663,P.

Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system for Diabetic Retinopathy screening using color fundus images using Deep learning,2020,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.6300339272795059,"Diabetes is a serious medical condition and regular screening for diabetes is of great importance as treatment options are most effective in the early stages of diabetes. Digital imaging of retina is considered as a low-cost method for screening and could be used in conjunction with computer-based image processing techniques to automatically detect early signs of diabetes utilizing diabetes-related pathologies visible in retinal fundus images. This research proposes a novel computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system for assisting with the screening of the population as up to 50% of the affected population are not aware of having diabetes. Moreover, these screenings are often carried out by an optometrist who receives some training with the patients being referred to an ophthalmologist if they show symptoms. Having a computer-assisted diagnosis system assisting the optometrist during the screening can greatly increase the detection rate for patients with diabetes by providing a second opinion and highlighting any suspicious pathologies. For achieving the highest detection rate possible, a hybrid machine learning approach is proposed in this research by combining Deep Learning with the AdaBoost classifier. The proposed computer-assisted diagnosis system starts with the segmentation of the blood vessels. Then, microaneurysms and exudates are segmentation from the image. Statistical and regional features are then extracted utilizing first, second, and higher-order image features. A Deep Learning framework will be utilized for extracting additional statistical image descriptors as a Deep Learning has superior contextual analysis capabilities compared to other machine learning techniques. Finally, the most informative features are selected by a minimal-redundancy maximal-relevance feature selection approach with an AdaBoost classifier analyzing all the features and informing the operator regarding the patient’s condition. Ethereum Swarm blockchain-based decentralized cloud file storage provides the proposed CAD users with a secure storage olution to access the patient information and related images. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the classification will be measured under clinical conditions. Healthcare, government, and public users would receive the most benefit from this project.",10.1109/SCOReD50371.2020.9250986,N. Memari; S. Abdollahi; M. M. Ganzagh; M. Moghbel

Enhanced Bitcoin Price Prediction Using RNN-GRU Algorithm with Optimized Parameters: Overcoming LSTM Ambiguities for Improved Accuracy and Efficiency,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9146792445268032,"Bitcoin's decentralised character and introduction in January 2009 can be mostly attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto, the unidentified designer of the digital money. Unlike regular money, Bitcoin has no value in and of itself and is not supported by any government or financial institution. The “mining” process consumes a lot of resources thus it cannot manage trades without a network of computers, often known as “nodes” or “miners.” The Bitcoin blockchain, a catalogue of all the past transactions, is maintained by these nodes. Like equities, bitcoin is getting more and more well-known even if it is somewhat erratic as an investment. Its value varies greatly; hence it is difficult to predict when prices will adjust. Since Bitcoin is so erratic, automated approaches are growing more crucial for future projections regarding it. Often utilised for prediction, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have constraints. LSTM focusses on short-term input and has a complex and occasionally ambiguous design, thus some claim it does not operate well when prior data is not significant to current forecasts. This has caused some to wonder if one can forecast Bitcoin's price using this approach. Made as a substitute for standard RNNs, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) helps to prevent the fading gradient issue. Bitcoin price projections made by the GRU design are far more accurate than those derived from more antiquated methods.",10.1109/IDCIOT64235.2025.10914986,M. Kathiravan; M. M; K. M; S. Sreesubha; S.

Empowering Individual Climate Action Through Carbon Tokenization,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.844039559499044,"Despite the establishment of global climate goals under the Paris Agreement, progress toward meeting emission reduction targets remains insufficient. A primary tool to tackle climate change is the carbon offset market. Traditional carbon markets are largely dominated by countries and large corporations, and while their contribution has been significant, it has been insufficient in meeting the carbon reduction targets. The primary deficiencies in these markets include supply-demand imbalances, limited accessibility, lack of transparency and standard regulatory frameworks, inefficiencies in verification, restricted participation, and a failure to adequately incentivize individual contributions. This paper argues that individuals must be integrated into the carbon offset market and carbon credit tokenization presents a viable and transformative mechanism for achieving this. By incentivizing sustainable behaviors through blockchain-based tokenized carbon credits, individuals can collectively contribute to emission reductions on a significant scale, complementing the efforts of governments and corporations. Through an analysis of existing market deficiencies, the transformative potential of tokenization, and the integration of behavioral economics principles, this paper advocates for an inclusive, decentralized, and transparent model that empowers individuals to take an active and meaningful role in addressing climate change. This approach will foster a sense of individual ownership and responsibility towards climate change, driving sustainable behavior and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon future.",10.1109/EDCC-C66476.2025.00035,U.

Research on intelligent detection technology of confidential documents based on OCR and semantic analysis,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8928580205509418,"With the acceleration of digital transformation in the power industry, confidential document management faces the dual challenges of the failure of the traditional “human defense” mode and the lack of technical control means. This study proposes an intelligent detection and transmission control system for confidential documents based on OCR(Optical Character Recognition) and semantic analysis, and builds a complete technical system for dynamic identification of multimodal confidential identification, parsing of heterogeneous documents and real-time interception. First, the feature extraction capabilities of text, image and mixed documents are integrated through a multimodal fusion framework: the enhanced OCR engine based on CNN-LSTM realizes text parsing of unstructured images, combines regular expression matching and deep learning semantic analysis to build a dynamic weight dictionary library, and uses user feedback-driven online learning mechanism to improve the scene adaptability of identification recognition. Secondly, a unified document parsing engine is designed, and modular adapters are used to support structured parsing and streaming processing of multiple formats such as PDF, DOCX, and OFD. The cross-modal sensitive content recognition is realized through a rule-model collaborative detection framework, and the sub-second response speed is achieved in government and industrial data set tests. Finally, a transmission control system based on kernel-state monitoring and dynamic strategies was developed.

A Soulbound Token Certificate Verification System (SBTCert): Design and Implementation,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9248054236874585,"Certificate authentication is considered to be one of the most tedious and complex processes. Moreover, different types of documents like banking documents, education certificates, and government documents might need a specific type of authentication and verification. For example, the process of verifying the authenticity of education certificates with conclusive evidence can take up to months and consume a lot of human effort. Hence, universities and colleges have no option but to consider the documents submitted by students, even if they might be fabricated. Sometimes an artfully generated forged certificate is almost impossible to detect and can be treated as the original. With the increase of forged documents, the credibility of both the document holder and the issuing authority is jeopardized. On the other hand, when students go through multiple phases of education, they are compelled to submit several documents to secure admission to universities or colleges, or sometimes even more frequently for scholarships and tuition concessions. Therefore, hosting these certificates in a secure and tamper-proof manner on a decentralized blockchain only allows participating parties to read or verify data to reduce errors and make it more transparent. In this paper, we proposed and implemented a Soulbound Token Certification (SBTCert) Verification System, a blockchain-based digital certificate platform, that aims to enhance the verification model without compromising security, authentication, decentralization, and confidentiality. The system provides a secure and reliable platform for universities, students, and staff to manage, issue, and verify educational certificates.",10.1109/CCWC60891.2024.10427736,T. V. Tumati; Y.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. In the field of cryptography, quantum computing is expected to be able to successfully attack most of the currently used cryptographic algorithms, especially public-key designs, so the academic community has been working on quantum-resistant primitives and algorithms. However, practical computers that can be used for breaking highly secure systems are not expected to be available in the near term. This means that, in the next few years, prequantum and quantum algorithms will coexist, and in the meantime, new threats against existing security algorithms will appear, which affects deployments in contexts as different as blockchain technology, electronic voting, or implantable medical devices.

The major attractive features of V2X communication is the inherent ability to adapt to any type of network, device, or data, and to ensure robustness, resilience and reliability of the network, which is challenging to realize. In this work, we propose to drive further these features by proposing a novel robust, resilient and reliable architecture for V2X communication based on harnessing MEC and blockchain technology. A three stage computing service is proposed. Firstly, a hierarchcial computing architecture is deployed spanning over the vehicular network that constitutes cloud computing (CC), edge computing (EC), fog computing (FC) nodes. The resources and data bases can migrate from the high capacity cloud services (furthest away from the individual node of the network) to the edge (medium) and low level fog node, according to computing service requirements. Secondly, the resource allocation filters the data according to its significance, and rank the nodes according to their usability, and selects the network technology according to their physical channel characteristics. Thirdly, we propose a blockchain-based transaction service that ensures reliability. We discussed two use cases for experimental analysis, plug-in electric vehicles in smart grid scenarios, and massive IoT data services for autonomous cars. The results show that car connectivity prediction is accurate 98% of the times, where 92% more data blocks are added using micro-blockchain solution compared to the public blockchain, where it is able to reduce the time to sign and compute the proof-of-work (PoW), and deliver a low-overhead Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel scheme, which integrates blockchain technology within a software defined network (SDN) enabled EC framework, tailored for 6G-assisted smart cities. A layered scheme is presented, where smart city data is aggregated through EC interface and presented to control plane virtual network functions (VNFs). The SDN controller enforce policies via virtual network controllers (VNCs), ensuring optimal resource distribution and network agility. Performance evaluation is performed for SDN control plane analysis, 6G analysis, and blockchain transaction analysis. The results indicate the potential viability in 6G assisted smart city setup.",10.1109/GCWkshp64532.2024.11100464,P. Bhattacharya; S. K. Singh; H. Liu; T. R. Gadekallu

Organisation and managing available parking spaces have raised a lot of awareness. Traditional centralized parking approaches are with an insidious single point of failure and unsuitable for large organization because the manager is overburdened with authority and responsibility. The malicious service provider enables to (i) track the precise mobility patterns of citizens. (ii) collect the data to infer privacy-sensitive information, e.g., where the parking requester (i.e., driver) socialize, work, and live; (iii) analyze trajectories to monitor the location of the driver for entertainment (e.g., discovering one-night stands). To design a decentralized smart and practical parking platform without compromising the privacy of the entities is an urgent issue for the smart city. Blockchain (or distributed public ledger technology) is a near-ideal decentralized and distributed solution for centralized parking-space-recommendation systems. However, most of the existing parking recommendation solutions on top of blockchain ignore to protect the privacy of drivers during parking spot detection and matching phases while cannot maintain the property of anonymity of the drivers.

An Architecture for Distributed Energies Trading in Byzantine-Based Blockchains,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8180752379251017,"With the development of smart cities, not only are all corners of the city connected to each other, but also connected from city to city. They form a large distributed network together, which can facilitate the integration of Distributed Energy Stations (DESs) and corresponding smart aggregators. Nevertheless, because of potential security and privacy protection arising from trustless energies trading, how to make such energies trading go smoothly is a tricky challenge. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based multiple energies trading (B-MET) system for secure and efficient energies trading by executing a smart contract we design. Because energies trading requires the blockchain in B-MET system to have high throughput and low latency, we design a new byzantine-based consensus mechanism (BCM) based on node’s credit to improve efficiency for the consortium blockchain under the B-MET system. Then, we take combined heat and power (CHP) system as a typical example that provides distributed energies. We quantify their utilities and model the interactions between aggregators and DESs in a smart city by a novel multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. It is analyzed and solved by reaching Nash equilibrium between aggregators, which reflects the competition between aggregators to purchase energies from DESs. In the end, we conduct plenty of numerical simulations to evaluate and verify our proposed model and algorithms, which demonstrate their correctness and efficiency completely.",10.1109/TGCN.2022.3142438,J.

HAPPS: A Hidden Attribute and Privilege-Protection Data-Sharing Scheme With Verifiability,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5538883313866724,"Data is a key asset in our interconnected and smart city. Especially, in the context of healthcare, healthcare data can facilitate remote diagnosis and medical research. Because of the potentially sensitive nature of healthcare data, privacy is a key consideration for both individuals and organizations. We can broadly categorize privacy considerations into data privacy, attribute privacy, and privilege policy privacy. To support one or more notions of privacy, the potential of solutions, such as fine-grained access control [e.g., those based on attribute-based encryption (ABE)] and blockchain in realizing data sharing has been explored. However, these approaches generally only facilitate access control of data and the traceability of the sharing process, and do not protect the attribute and privilege policy privacy of users. Therefore, in this article, we implement HAPPS, a hidden attribute and privilege-protection data-sharing scheme with verifiability. The three key building blocks of HAPPS are zero-knowledge proof, blockchain, and distributed ABE (DABE). Specifically, in our approach, we propose a new data access control strategy (i.e., attribute-hidden zero-knowledge proof—at-ZKP) to hide user identity and attributes during the authorization process. Our scheme is embedded in the blockchain and built into the decentralized sharing platform to prevent central verifier counterfeiting and support auditing. To demonstrate utility, we prove that HAPPS ensures data, attribute, and privilege policy privacy. Findings of our evaluations implemented on Ethereum and using the data set from the healthcare cost and utilization project (HCUP), we demonstrate that our scheme can share sensitive healthcare records belonging to minors (e.g., children) without the at-ZKP incurring unrealistic cost.",10.1109/JIOT.2022.3197708,W.

Furthermore, they are conducive to improving the protection of property rights, strengthening the market’s allocation of resources, realizing the fair distribution of benefits, strengthening the government’s penetrating supervision, and creating a mutually beneficial business environment. Therefore, the token economy is expected to become a new form of digital economy with mutual trust and collective governance.

Automatic Generation of Ethereum-Based Smart Contracts for Agri-Food Traceability System,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9810476867972596,"There is a growing demand for transparency along the agri-food chain, both from customers and governments. The adoption of blockchain technology to enable secure traceability for the management of the agri-food chain, provide information such as the provenance of a food product and prevent food fraud, is emerging rapidly, due to the inherent trust and inalterability provided by this technology. However, developing the right smart contracts for these use cases is even more of a challenge than it is for those used in other fields. Several management systems for the agri-food chain based on blockchain technology and smart contract have been proposed, all however ad-hoc for a specific product or production process and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a new approach to easily customize and compose general Ethereum-based smart contracts designed for the agri-food industrial domain, to be able to reuse the code and modules and automate the process to shorten development times, while keeping it safe and reliable. Starting from the definition of the real production process, we aim to automatically generate both the smart contracts to manage the system and the user interfaces to interact with them, thus producing a system that works semi-automatically. Additionally, we describe a honey production case study to show how our approach works. Future work will first extend the scope of the approach to other supply chains, furthermore, while the current platform used is Ethereum, in the future our approach will be easily extended to other blockchain platforms.",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3171045,L.

CredTrust: Credential Based Issuer Management for Trust in Self-Sovereign Identity,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7761767332332062,"Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) facilitates secure issuance and verification of digitised credentials without having to rely on a centralised authority. Most SSI implementations rely on blockchain to take advantage of decentralisation and cryptographic security over the credentials. Given that verifying the authenticity of credentials such as identification papers or proof of qualifications are critical to the system, current SSI solutions, assume the issuers to be “official” entities (e.g., government agencies) who must follow a stringent process to vet their credentials. However, there is no systematic support for directing the same level of trust agencies for individual users who may issue credentials (e.g., delegation of access, consent letter) in the context of business processes. A verifier who relies on user-issued credentials to complete a business process (e.g., a postal worker handing over parcel to someone other than the addressee) bears the risk of accepting these credentials without reliance on a trust agency. This paper proposes CredTrust, a blockchain based SSI framework that allows individual users to be “onboarded” to the platform as a verifiable issuer via the establishment of a trust registry in the blockchain. Our approach utilises the existing SSI credential generation and verification processes to create a “chain of trust” as a trust propagation method.

As one such IoT application, the smart city is designed to use intelligent services in an environment where transport, environment, energy, living, governance, and civic components are integrated to operate the city in a smart and efficient manner. Surprisingly, however, the current state-of-the-art on blockchain does not show the progress on diversified services of the complex IIoT applications. This paper tends to fill the gap and presents a scalable block graph platform and consensus protocol for the complex IIoT applications by adopting the limited resources of IIoT devices. The platform and consensus protocol are generic in the sense that they can support any practical service. The directed acyclic graph represents a significant exhibition in improving the scalability of blockchains and supports our proposed consensus protocol in substance; moreover, the detailed syntax of the block graph is defined. The consensus protocol is showed to be secure against disloyal voting, sybil attack, and 51% attack.

Efficient Designated Verifier Signature for Secure Cross-Chain Health Data Sharing in BIoMT,2024,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,1.0,"Blockchain technology brings a method for cross-institution health data sharing through the systems of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). As different medical institutions compete to establish their own blockchain ledgers, it leads to new problems of “data island.” In this article, a relay chain-based multichain fusion (MCF) model has been designed for blockchain-enabled IoMT (BIoMT), which can achieve cross-institution health data sharing by composing different blockchains together. In this MCF model, the existing patient private health chain, medical institution chain, and government supervision chain compose a cross-chain health data-sharing platform, which extends the storage capacity of health data, and the capacity of data sharing among different departments, institutions, and fields. Meanwhile, a cross-chain transaction model has been established which helps to achieve secure cross-chain transactions among different medical institutions. Then, to guarantee user privacy in the cross-chain transaction process, a designated verifier signature (DVS) scheme is proposed. Only the designated verifier can verify this DVS and other users cannot identify the real signer. This DVS also can achieve the anonymity of the signer as the third party cannot distinguish the signature generated by the signer or the verifier. Moreover, the proposed DVS scheme can be proved to capture the unforgeability, nontransferability, and signer anonymity with the random oracle model. The theoretical analyses and efficiency comparisons are given which show the efficiency of the proposed DVS scheme compared with similar schemes. The performance simulation of the cross-chain transaction shows that the MCF model is secure and practical for cross-chain health data sharing among different BIoMT systems.",10.1109/JIOT.2024.3370708,C.

Fintech Ecosystem in Russia,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.742942419635357,"Fintech is today not only a hot mass media discussion of the future of the financial sector, but also real projects that change banking and financial services. The paper describes features and characteristics of contemporary Russian fintech landscape and ecosystem. The examples of innovative financial services in Russia, including online banking and accounting, new payments and transfers services, platforms for crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, blockchain initiatives, etc. are discussed. It is shown that fintech initiatives have not yet led to a radical transformation of the financial sector in Russia because participants of the fintech ecosystem have different points of view on fintech. Russian banks are now developing fintech initiatives within themselves, encouraging technology companies and fintech startups to focus their efforts on innovations that are aimed at improving processes, rather than opening new markets. The Government directs the main efforts to initiatives related to regulation of cryptocurrencies circulation and to introduction of blockchain in regtech and cybersecurity.

Assessment of Electronic Authentication Policies using Multi-Stakeholder Multi-Criteria Hierarchical Decision Modeling,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7767333976833588,"Standards allow society to be efficient, and interconnected. For expediency, a country may adopt a policy of domestic standards which may require reconsideration to conform to international ones to support global markets. However, the policy reform process is complex because adopting standards involves not only technological, but also political, economic, and social perspectives. Also, there may be conflict and dissent between the transition winners and losers. An effective method to rationally assess and rank policy alternatives is with a hierarchical decision model (HDM) that includes competing perspectives and their respective criteria. In the early 2000s, the South Korean government standardized and mandated electronic authentication technologies to mitigate technological gaps in e-commerce. However, this standardization also created problems causing Korea to lag in online security and being limited to a Microsoft-specific monoculture. Internationally, other de facto standards have been adopted such as secure sockets layer (SSL), and blockchain is being considered. In 2015, the Korean government eventually changed its policy by eliminating the e-commerce mandate to enable banks and other institutions to adopt different standards. This policy reform took sixteen years because of its pervasiveness. In this study, a HDM is developed specifically for Korea to assess the post-reform policy options.",10.23919/PICMET.2018.8481798,W.

Land Registration System Using Block-chain,2020,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,1.0,"In the traditional Land Registration system practiced in India, there exists a middle man (broker) who establishes a contact between the buyer and seller, for instance if an individual wants to buy or sell a property, the broker will create and assemble all the obligatory physical documents with regards to an agreement as a proof of property. Brokers will ensure that the land/property would be registered by an authorised government office where all the attributes are noted down in a ledger and thereafter the whole transaction and purchasement between the two parties takes place. In this scenario, there are chances of losing or tampering of the documents as anyone with certain powers can access or alter the papers easily which in turn threatens this concrete proof of land. Thus, this type of system as compared to our proposed system in which we make use of a smart contract to deal with the assets and transactions among the participants, is relatively time consuming, less secure and unsynchronized where activities including corruption and fraudulence might be associated during the execution of the required process.

SoK: Cryptojacking Malware,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency-based technologies are redefining the way we conduct business in cyberspace. Today, a myriad of blockchain and cryp-tocurrency systems, applications, and technologies are widely available to companies, end-users, and even malicious actors who want to exploit the computational resources of regular users through cryptojacking malware. Especially with ready-to-use mining scripts easily provided by service providers (e.g., Coinhive) and untraceable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Monero), cryptojacking malware has become an indispensable tool for attackers. Indeed, the banking industry, major commercial websites, government and military servers (e.g., US Dept. of Defense), online video sharing platforms (e.g., Youtube), gaming platforms (e.g., Nintendo), critical infrastructure resources (e.g., routers), and even recently widely popular remote video conferencing/meeting programs (e.g., Zoom during the Covid-19 pandemic) have all been the victims of powerful cryptojacking malware campaigns. Nonetheless, existing detection methods such as browser extensions that protect users with blacklist methods or antivirus programs with different analysis methods can only provide a partial panacea to this emerging crypto-jacking issue as the attackers can easily bypass them by using obfuscation techniques or changing their domains or scripts frequently. Therefore, many studies in the literature proposed cryptojacking malware detection methods using various dynamic/behavioral features. However, the literature lacks a systemic study with a deep understanding of the emerging cryptojacking malware and a comprehensive review of studies in the literature. To fill this gap in the literature, in this SoK paper, we present a systematic overview of cryptojacking malware based on the information obtained from the combination of academic research papers, two large cryptojacking datasets of samples, and 45 major attack instances.

Virtual Reality in Social media marketing will be the new model of advertising and monetization,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.918385585344541,"Advertisers and media owners are becoming more dependent on advertising, when the traditional way is losing its effect, they are eagerly looking for alternative ways to reach consumers, and keeping their brand trust, promise, and image at the top, and to generate more profit. Although there are many ways companies and brands alike can seek to make money off of social media, the traditional platforms are becoming obsolete. Gone are the days of having the logo, a photo, and an attractive slogan sufficient for attracting new customers. It can be said that advertising relies heavily on good aesthetics and application of the brand image, however applying that correctly to the target audience effectively can enhance and produce better outcomes, it's about how a business achieves success, scale worldwide, persuade consumers to buy into it, and reach its goals and profits. To create an effective and impactful advertisement in our modern world, companies must turn to technology; For technology is the enabler of a wider selection of tools that help businesses make better data-driven and informative decisions. This can be done by collecting data through third parties, internal or external surveys, and polls to enhance and improve their product delivery and message. With the use of data, algorithms can be then created to understand the consumer's behavior, therefore, enabling a business to better target its user-base based on their interests, search patterns, and online behavior. Moreover, the collected data from the mentioned tools can be then transformed into resourceful decisions to help the business better understand its user-base, therefore choosing from a plethora of options such as using influencers to advertise their product on live-video streams, or the traditional bloggers, and the many content creators available. Web3 is on the horizon, with the accelerative pace the metaverse took over the internet, brands turned to the newly found virtual space to promote themselves. This is a stepping stone into what is to come next as it taps into our day-to-day lives, economy, and social interactions [16].

There is tremendous interest in developing smart contract applications in banking, finance, insurance, government, and supply chain markets. Many of these applications operate in a cyber-physical environment and adopt architectures based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies to support monitoring and ensure data integrity. To investigate how cyber-physical smart contracts are realized for compliance monitoring, together with associated challenges and research opportunities. A mapping review of the literature that surveys underlying architectures and their evaluation. The publications considered came from four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar), supplemented by manual snowballing. All publications considered are peer-reviewed, written in English, and published in non-predatory venues. A total of 368 publications were considered, with a final selection of 50 papers (all published between 2018 and 2023) that were analyzed along three dimensions: Cyber-physical architectures, infrastructure failures, and technical challenges. Blockchain technologies are the most commonly used platform for smart contracts as they provide decentralized architectures deploying interesting communication patterns, as well as multiple technologies to simplify communication for producing and consuming events. Moreover, such architectures can lead to many types of infrastructure failures including sensor/actuator attacks, network outages, and hardware/software failures, resulting in five important technical challenge areas related to security, availability, robustness, privacy, and legal aspects. Key insights and directions for future research are also reported. This review will inform readers about how cyber-physical smart contracts are being built and deployed and the challenges that are faced by their builders and users.",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3290899,S.

ID-Care: A Model for Sharing Wide Healthcare Data,2023,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.8255479871430481,"All over the world, there is a lot of patient health data in different locations such as hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, and other organizations. In this sense, global identification of the patient has emerged as an everyday healthcare challenge. Governments and institutions have to prioritize satisfactory, quick, and integrated decision-making in a wide, dispersed, and global environment because of unexpected challenges like pandemics or threats. In the current scientific literature, some of the existing challenges include support for a standard global unique identification that considers privacy issues, the combination of multiple technological biometry implementations, and personal documents. Thus, we propose a decentralized software model based on blockchain and smart contracts that includes privacy, global unique person identification supporting multiple combinations of documents, and biometric data using the Global Standards 1 - GS1 healthcare industry standard. Furthermore, we defined a methodology to evaluate a hypothetical use case of this model where an integrated and standard global health data sharing personal identification is crucial. For this, we implemented the proposed model in a global-wide continent location through cloud machines, fog computing, and blockchain considering the unique patient data identification and evaluate a use case scenario based on the top 5 most globally visited tourist destinations (France, Spain, the United States of America, China, and Italy), with an approach based on this model. The results show that using a model for a global id for healthcare can help reduce costs, time, and efforts, especially in the context of health threats, where agility and financial support must be prioritized.",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249109,H.

Decentralised Social Media,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6667775785245909,"The present approach to social networks is focused on putting all of the power in the hands of a single platform. Conflicts are unavoidable when consumers, authors, marketers, or governments disagree on the platform. Users and developers of online social networks now lack much-needed privacy and security. Decentralisation contributes to changing this situation. People need a platform that is dependable, predictable, and free. This trust might shift from a company's closed corporate policy to open blockchain technologies. Its predictable condition can offer the required security and stability for artists to operate on the platform. Decentralisation is the way of the future. Instead of utilising a centralised server that is owned by a company, decentralised social networks operate on servers that are independent. Blockchain technology allows data inputs to be saved on servers located anywhere in the world. Because everyone on a network can view the data in near real-time, it fosters openness. Users may sign up with their social media accounts to learn how the network operates and what other users have to say. Instead of having a firm monitor the material, the creator of a federated social network may define the site's acceptable conduct.",10.1109/ViTECoN58111.2023.10157136,P. K. Bhusare; B. M. R.

VCTP: A Verifiable Credential-Based Trust Propagation Protocol for Personal Issuers in Self-Sovereign Identity Platforms,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7850158215898427,"Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an emerging identity system that facilitates secure credential issuance and verification without placing trust in any centralised authority. To bypass central trust, most SSI implementations place blockchain as a trusted mediator by placing credential transactions on-chain. Yet, existing SSI platforms face trust issues as all credential issuers in SSI are not supported with adequate trust. Current SSI solutions provide trust support to the officiated issuers (e.g., government agencies), who must follow a precise process to assess their credentials. However, there is no structured trust support for individuals of SSI who may attempt to issue a credential (e.g., letter of consent) in the context of business processes. Therefore, some risk-averse verifiers in the system may not accept the credentials from individual issuers to avoid carrying the cost of mishaps from potentially inadmissible credentials without reliance on a trusted agency. This paper proposes a trust propagation protocol that supports individual users to be trusted as verifiable issuers in the SSI platform by establishing a trust propagation credential template in the blockchain. Our approach utilises (i) the sanitizable signature scheme to propagate the required trust to an individual issuer, (ii) a voting mechanism to minimises the possibility of collusion. Our implementation demonstrates that the solution is both practical and performs well under varying system loads.",10.1109/DAPPS57946.2023.00023,R. Mukta; R. C. Teh; H. -Y. Paik; Q. Lu; S. S. Kanhere

Decentralized and Incentivized Voting System with Web3 Technology Ensuring Anonymity and Preventing Double Voting,2023,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,0.41676759962244,"Due to the impact of the pandemic and globalization, many governments worldwide have begun to replace paper voting with electronic voting systems. This is primarily intended to increase voting efficiency and reduce personnel costs. However, electronic voting is usually centralized, which creates difficulties in ensuring the integrity of the voting process and protecting voter privacy. As a solution, we propose an efficient and anonymous web3-based voting system that provides incentives. The use of blockchain technology ensures that voting results are stored in a decentralized manner, reducing the possibility of tampering and ensuring vote integrity. To protect voter privacy, our system incorporates stealth addresses to conceal ballot content and lightweight ring signatures to verify voter validity without the risk of double voting. Furthermore, our voting system utilizes smart contracts to encourage voting and self-tallying, resulting in improved transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms several existing e-voting systems, thus providing a robust and secure alternative for governments seeking to improve their voting systems.",10.1109/DSC61021.2023.10354239,L. -Y.

FACOS: Enabling Privacy Protection Through Fine-Grained Access Control With On-Chain and Off-Chain System,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6154607176812599,"Data-driven landscape across finance, government, and healthcare, the continuous generation of information demands robust solutions for secure storage, efficient dissemination, and fine-grained access control. Blockchain technology emerges as a significant tool, offering decentralized storage while upholding the tenets of data security and accessibility. However, on-chain and off-chain strategies are still confronted with issues such as untrusted off-chain data storage, absence of data ownership, limited access control policy for clients, and a deficiency in data privacy and auditability. To solve these challenges, we propose a permissioned blockchain-based privacy-preserving fine-grained access control on-chain and off-chain system, namely FACOS. We applied three fine-grained access control solutions and comprehensively analyzed them in different aspects, which provides an intuitive perspective for system designers and clients to choose the appropriate access control method for their systems. Compared to similar work that only stores encrypted data in centralized or non-fault-tolerant IPFS systems, we enhanced off-chain data storage security and robustness by utilizing a highly efficient and secure asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocol in the off-chain environment. As each of the clients needs to be verified and authorized before accessing the data, we involved the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-based solution to verify the credentials of clients. Additionally, our evaluation results demonstrated that our system (https://github.com/cliu717/AsynchronousStorage) offers better scalability and practicality than other state-of-the-art designs. We deployed our system on Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud and conducted multiple evaluations. The results indicate that it takes about 2.79 seconds for a client to execute the protocol for uploading and about 0.96 seconds for downloading. Compared to other decentralized systems, our system exhibits efficient latency for both download and upload operations.",10.1109/TIFS.2024.3427311,C. Liu; C. Hou; T. Jiang; J. Ning; H. Qiao; Y. Wu

For individual participants, minimal invasion of privacy suppresses concerns regarding large-scale adoption. From organizations’ perspectives, using blockchain avoids single point of failure and enhances the robustness of the entire system against malicious attacks. On the policy side, we propose a reward quantification mechanism to motivate engagement. Potential funding sources to ensure ongoing sustainability are also discussed. We have demonstrated Fiesta through simulation testbeds and real-world deployments with two demo tasks.

An Effective Anti-Money Laundering System Using Block Chain Technology,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7550588354523614,"In the developed financial services industry, identity is defined using government-issued identification cards. Nevertheless, the primary obstacles in the consolidation and authentication of these data in connection with large-scale anti-money laundering (AML) requirements have significantly increased the challenges for individuals seeking to enter the financial system. This renders it exceedingly unprofitable and a greater risk for banking systems to engage with developing economies that might lack even the most primitive forms of identification. Furthermore, the process of establishing a banking account is packed with difficulty as a result of protracted processing times, substantial report obligations, and ambiguity surrounding the utilization of confidential customer data. The objective of cash laundering is to return illegal funds to their source; therefore, money launderers typically employ robust financial structures to transport funds. Additionally, the level of money laundering activity may become more geographically concentrated as the amount of money laundered increases. For many years, the financial quarter has been working to reevaluate the concept of identity. Blockchain is an emerging computing structure that enables the integration of disparate data points from authoritative source vendors into a unified digital ledger of validated, unalterable, transparent, and cryptographically protected data. Furthermore, secrecy can be ensured by letting the appropriate person or group control how their identity is shared. A blockchain is a distributed, virtual ledger that is unchangeable and keeps track of transactions in chronological order and close to real time. In order for later transactions to be added to the ledger the community members also known also nodes, must agree on them. This establishes an ongoing management mechanism that oversees issues related to manipulation, errors, and statistics. After dispatch Information contained within a block cannot be altered or tampered with in a sequence, thereby generating a transparent and authentic file for the transaction.",10.1109/ICSSEECC61126.2024.10649485,D.

Despite national policies and regulations like the “Data Security Law” and “Data Classification and Grading Standards” providing a legal framework for data management, the existing classification and grading standards do not offer specific guidance for image data. This leads to unique challenges in managing and protecting image data in practical applications. This study proposes a set of methods for the automatic classification and graded protection of sensitive image data, aiming to fill the current gap in image data management. By analyzing the needs of government affairs, transportation, and education scenarios, this paper establishes a set of image data classification and grading standards applicable to multiple scenarios. The study employs machine learning technologies, especially the multi-head attention mechanism, to efficiently identify sensitive or security-related information within image data and accurately classify and grade it accordingly. Furthermore, this paper explores the application of blockchain technology in the regulation of image data access and use, proposing a novel data protection mechanism. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper for the automatic classification, graded protection, and supervision of sensitive image data across different scenarios not only fills a theoretical gap but also demonstrates excellent application potential and practical value in practice.

Despite its benefits for a wide range of applications, MCS lacks an efficient incentive mechanism, restricting the development of IoT applications, especially for Internet of Vehicles (IoV)-a typical example of IoT applications; this is because vehicles are usually reluctant to participate these sensing tasks. Moreover, in practice, some sensing tasks may arrive suddenly (called an emergent task) in the IoV environment, but the resources of a single vehicle may be insufficient to handle, and thus multivehicles collaboration is required. In this case, the incentive mechanisms for the participation of multiple vehicles and the task scheduling for their collaborations are collectively needed. To address this important problem, we first propose a new model for the scenario of two vehicles collaboration, considering the situation of the emergent appearance of a task. In this model, for a general sensing task, we propose a bidding mechanism to better encourage vehicles to contribute their resources, and the tasks for those vehicles are scheduled accordingly. Second, for an emergent task, a novel time-window-based method is devised to manage the tasks among vehicles and to incent the vehicles to participate.

While the qualitative nature of this unique system is clearly accepted and understood, there are some issues regarding to its decentralized network environment. Based on our analysis due to the high variance of solo mining, the number of users joining top most famous Bitcoin mining pools are increasing due to the fact that users together under a Bitcoin pool will have a higher chance of generating next block in the Bitcoin's blockchain by reducing the variance and earning the mining reward. Furthermore, emerging huge mining farms with strong mining resources and fast processing power is another trend toward centralization. Although some might argue that, the protocol itself is purely decentralized and these are marketbased centralization, this trend clearly illustrates that the pure, decentralized protocol of Bitcoin is going toward centralization in its distributed network, where any kind of centralization should be considered carefully due to the 51% attack. By analysing all the created blocks from 2009 to 2014 we proposed a centralization factor which shows how centralized is the state of Bitcoin's network in different years. Centralization, due its simplicity, is a phenomenon that happens to any disciplined and organized system automatically, which in case of Bitcoin is against the pure initial decentralized nature of it and might arise some concerns and threats to the Bitcoin's unforeseeable future.",10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176229,A.

Adaptive Routing in Urban Wireless Ad Hoc Networks Using AI-Assisted Algorithms,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8675497362459614,Modern smart city applications as well as vehicular communication and emergency response systems heavily depend on Urban Wireless Ad Hoc Networks (UWAHNs). Conventional network routing procedures face multiple challenges in handling abrupt route topology changes and delayed performance and consume excessive energy while operating in unsecure environments. A proposed routing procedure incorporates artificial intelligence through reinforcement learning predictive models and hybrid optimization with PSO-GA to improve network performance characteristics. Real-time network condition analysis allows the algorithm to dynamically choose the best routing paths which enhances packet delivery and maximizes transmission effectiveness. The proposed routing design supported by AI assistance exceeds traditional methods according to extensive simulation results. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's delivery of 94.7% packet success rates while decreasing end-to-end delay by 40% with 30% reduced energy usage to extend the network's operational lifespan.

Decentralized Ledger for Land and Property Transactions in Sri Lanka Acresense,2018,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,1.0,"Land & property can be identified as one of the core assets in any county in the world. Governments spend significant amount of money to identify, define, manage and maintain the transactional information around land and property in a country. Creating a proper mechanism to make this information available to the public users can be considered as one of the key indications that shows the development of a country. The system currently in use to record land and property transactions in Sri Lanka is a book-based system where all the information is stored in handwritten folios. This method is inefficient, time consuming, unsecured and complex when compared to the advanced systems which are used by developed countries in the world. This study is carried out to find a secured, efficient, cost effective solution with regards to the concerns and other problems related to land and property transactions in Sri Lanka. Proposed solution includes a decentralized ledger to record land and property transactions which runs on top of blockchain technology. All new transaction entries will be validated by smart contracts to verify the validity of the transactions. After performing a proper consensus mechanism, the transaction records will be stored in cryptographically secured blocks. So, the data integrity could not be violated. Additionally, investors and the land buyers can get information about the current market trends & predictions before buying or investing into a land. Also, the proposed system supports the users to view the land information graphically and allows the system users to view the desired land parcels without physically going to the actual location via the geographical information system.",10.1109/R10-HTC.2018.8629811,I.

Sharing is Caring: Collaborative Analysis and Real-Time Enquiry for Security Analytics,2018,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.7973639649239357,"For decades it has been acknowledged that sharing security information and collaboration between security practitioners are a necessity. Yet, effective sharing and collaboration are rare. A gamut of legislative acts, executive orders, academic works, and private sector initiatives have discussed aspects of the problem and aimed to be the catalyst needed to fix the situation. But almost 30 years since these efforts started, the state of sharing and collaboration is still technically complicated, slow, untrusted, and impeded by bureaucratic woes. This work identifies the challenges of sharing security artifacts and uses real-world examples to illustrate our findings. Based on this knowledge, we propose a new model for sharing and collaboration, CARE. The CARE architecture eases many of the privacy, secrecy, lineage, and structure issues that plague current sharing communities and platforms. We then build upon this foundation to introduce a marketplace based on smart contracts with transactional privacy over a distributed blockchain. Therefore, CARE incentivizes sharing, combats free riding, and provides an immutable ledger for the attribution of events. This paradigm shift, overcomes the challenges of sharing while providing new opportunities for business models, insurance risk assessments, and government backed incentivisation.",10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00240,G.

Bayesi-Chain: Intelligent Identity Authentication,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"In a bid to stamp out fraudulent crime, there is increased pressure on individuals to provide evidence that they possess a ‘real’ identity. Counterfeiting and fake identities have reduced confidence in traditional paper documentation as proof of identity, this has created a demand for an intelligent digital alternative. Recent government implementations and identity trends have also improved the popularity of digital forms of identification.Authentication of identity is a salient issue in the current climate where identity theft through record duplication is on the rise. Identity resolution techniques have proven effective in filtering duplicated and fake records in identity management systems. These techniques have been further improved by the implementation of machine learning techniques which are capable of revealing patterns and links that have formerly gone undetected. Research has also suggested that incorporating non-standard attributes in the form of social contextual data can increase the efficiency and success-rate of these fraud detection methods.In the digital age where individuals are creating large digital footprints, online accounts and activities can prove to be a valuable source of information that may contribute to ‘proof’ that an asserted identity is genuine. Online social contextual data – or ‘Digital identities’ -- pertaining to real people are built over time and bolstered by associated accounts, relationships and attributes. This data is difficult to fake and therefore may have the capacity to provide proof of a ‘real’ identity.This paper outlines the design and initial development of a solution that utilizes data sourced from an individual’s digital footprint to assess the likelihood that it pertains to a ‘real’ identity. This is achieved through application of machine learning and Bayesian probabilistic modelling techniques. Where identity sources are considered reliable, a secure and intelligent digital identification artefact will be created. This artefact will emulate a blockchain-inspired ledger and may subsequently be used to prove identity in place of traditional paper documentation.",10.1109/ISSC.2018.8585369,J. Blue; J. Condell; T.

Towards Governance and Dispute Resolution for DLT and Smart Contracts,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Illegal content on a blockchain cannot be removed and the originator might not be identifiable. At the same time, node operators that have no control over the content stored on their nodes might be held legally responsible. As a decentralized system, Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) needs decentralized governance and smart contract dispute resolution. Existing DLT governance and dispute resolution is only aimed at balancing the interests of DLT and smart contract participants. It fails to address the interests of third parties and society. The failure to do so could trigger government and court intervention within DLT systems. Although the decentralized nature of a DLT system will offer some protection against this intervention, participants might be identifiable and subject to legal prosecution. We present a design also addressing the interests of society and third parties that will have to be accompanied by an international legal framework.",10.1109/ICSESS.2018.8663721,J. Erbguth; J. -H.

Converging Technologies for Safety Planning and Inspection Information System of Portable Firefighting Equipment,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Many construction workers are getting injured or killed in fires and explosion accidents each year. The workers are prone to severe fatal accidents due to unavailability of permanent firefighting system in many construction sites, thus they typically rely on portable firefighting equipment (PFE) to minimize fire damage. Many occupational health and safety agencies have developed safety regulations for PFE installation and monitoring in construction. However, in the traditional construction fire safety management process, the installation spots for PFE's are visually identified in a 2D floor plan and then top-down supervisory approach is used to inspect the active availability of the PFE's. Such manually operated conventional methods of PFE installation and monitoring are expensive, prone to manipulation, and do not provide sufficient motivation for voluntarily following fire safety policies. Therefore, this research study develops a fire safety rule-based PFE installation approach and proposes an alternative method for shifting the top-down inspection approach to the bottom-up voluntarily approach for convenient, transparent, and automated safety inspection information delivery. To validate the bottom-up approach concept, a visual language algorithm is initially developed for PFE installation planning system (PFE-IPS) in BIM, followed by an optical character recognition (OCR) and blockchain -based android application for safety inspection information system (SIIS). This article also presents two case studies to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the developed systems. The proposed approach out-turn reduces the safety manager's manual efforts and burdens of government safety auditors while enhancing efficiency and reliability.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039512,N.

Acceptance Towards Digital Payments and Improvements in Cashless Payment Ecosystem,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7489446440796547,"""Faceless, Paperless, Cashless"". ‘Digital India’ is a flagship programme of the Government of India that envisions India as a digitally empowered knowledge economy. As India emerges a global competitor in innovative population-scale payment systems, various digital payment methods have been introduced nation-wide, including Micro ATMs, Banking Cards, Internet Banking, UPI (Unified Payment Interface), Mobile Banking, and Mobile Wallets. However, the Indian economy identifies an unapparent barrier between the growth of Digital India and complete acceptance towards Digital Payment System. India’s present usage of cash as a payment mode can be measured in the terms of India’s cash to GDP (Gross Domestic Product) ratio of 11.4 percent, as of 2019, which is considerably higher than several other developing and developed countries. This also includes costs of cash, such as costs of printing, maintaining cash supply to ATMs, incurred interest and costs due to counterfeit currency, which round up to 10 to 30 percent of India’s GDP. This research studies prior literature and consumer behaviour via ground-level surveys and interviews. We also analyse the cryptic challenges faced by users belonging to different age groups towards complete acceptance of digital payments and modes. For instance, a significant proportion of digital users are minors which spurs the need of shared wallets to allow governed transactions by dependent users. Also, symmetric inter-app transactions, intelligent resolution for effective redressal, credible incentivisation, short-term loans, etc. are proposed. As an outcome, a more reliable, secure, and contemporary working model for a Digital Payment Wallet service using Blockchain Technology has been developed.",10.1109/INCET49848.2020.9154024,R.

The New Concept of Guaranteeing Confidence in the E-Voting System,2020,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,0.6982179891908845,"There is no doubt about the urgency of ensuring trust in e-voting systems since elections without trust cannot be acceptable in a democratic society. To solve this problem, it was proposed to use blockchain technology, however, in voting systems this leads to significant delays in the execution of transactions, and the software solution is accessible only to a narrow circle of specialists, which clearly does not help to show confidence on the part of voters. This paper proposes a different approach, which is based on the widely available verification of all means and processes that may cause distrust in the accuracy of the vote count or in ensuring their confidentiality. We offer a solution to the problem of transparency of all hardware and software that cause distrust. Voting systems that use this approach are implemented in three leading Ukrainian universities for student elections to self-government bodies.

Framework for a Decentralized Web,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.582144766191045,"Over the past decade, we have witnessed the Internet becoming increasingly centralized in the hands of a small number of giant technology firms, that control many of the most popular applications and the content they host on their platforms. In addition, in the majority of instances today, access to the Internet is usually provided through local internet service providers (ISPs) in each country. Governments in different jurisdictions can exert pressure on these technology firms and ISPs to enforce restrictions on Internet usage by their citizens, such as the blocking access to certain sites and/or content. In this paper, we present a promising new approach to circumventing some of these issues. Our decentralized web (DWeb) proposal makes use of a mesh network to connect community based routers. In addition, objects on the DWeb are indexed using blockchain technology, which allows for secure storage of immutable object references, and integrity checking of the data being served to users. Our DWeb design is also capable of operating during network partitions, and is able to quickly re-synchronize with the larger network once connectivity has been restored. The proposed concept is simulated using ns-3, Multichain and Docker technologies. The performance of the system is analysed for different cache replacement strategies with a varying number of gateway nodes. The Popularity-based cache replacement algorithm outperforms the other studied strategies, which show it is the best-suited strategy for the DWeb architecture. In summary, DWeb solves issues like data integrity, centralization and controlled access to the Internet, and the overall framework exhibits fair performance in the studied simulated environment.",10.1109/ITNAC50341.2020.9315032,R.

Enhancing Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions: A Bio-Inspired Fine-Tuned CatBoost Approach,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Financial institutions and individuals alike are vulnerable to the growing number and sophistication of fraudulent operations in today’s digital financial ecosystem. The most recent research from the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) estimates that global financial crimes in 2023 caused damages of $31 trillion. The integrity and equity of the international monetary system are gravely endangered by these transgressions, which encompass embezzlement, tax evasion, illicit trade, and money laundering. Governments and financial institutions have tried to limit these activities, but criminals still use developing technology like cryptocurrencies and intricate financial networks to avoid discovery. Using the CatBoost algorithm that has been fine-tuned in conjunction with the Cat Swarm Updated Black Widow (CSU-BW) optimisation model, this study suggests a hybrid fraud detection approach to tackle these difficulties. For reliable and scalable fraud detection, the CatBoost algorithm is used as the main classification model because of its proficiency with categorical data. The CSU-BW fine-tuner is a bio-inspired hybrid optimisation method that optimises hyperparameters and improves feature selection to promote classification accuracy. It is introduced to enhance performance. To compare the suggested model to more conventional machine learning algorithms and test it on datasets of actual financial transactions. A number of important performance metrics, score, were outperformed by conventional methods in the experiments conducted by CSU-BW on the CatBoost model. Confusion matrix analysis adds credence to its credibility as a technique for detecting financial fraud by confirming its high true positive rate and low false positive rate. This research introduces a high-performance, scalable fraud detection model that can adjust to new fraud trends by combining bio-inspired optimisation with sophisticated ensemble learning. Increased confidence in digital financial transactions, reduced risk of financial loss, and improved security are all goals of the suggested approach. Additional ways to enhance financial institutions’ fraud protection tactics can be investigated in future studies through the use of adaptive learning mechanisms, blockchain integration, and real-time fraud detection.",10.1109/ICoICC64033.2025.11052066,N.

HES: An Effective Homomorphic Encryption-Based Scheme for Data Quality Verification in Data Trading,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.611727465110609,"The digital economy is one of the most dynamic, fastest growing, and impactful domains in modern economic development. To fully exploit the potential value of data as an economic resource, many governments have implemented policies to encourage and regulate data circulation and Trade. However, current mechanisms for data circulation and transactions lack an effective approach for assessing data quality. This deficiency leads to inefficient data utilization and hinders the realization of its full economic value. This article proposes a decentralized homomorphic encryption-based scheme (HES) for data quality verification in data transactions, leveraging blockchain and cryptographic techniques. The proposed method introduces a data provenance token, which represents the original data, and employs cryptographic techniques to implement a zero-knowledge verification mechanism. This mechanism enables the verification of both the content and quality of the data while preserving data privacy. Buyers can verify datasets without accessing specific content or involving third-party intermediaries. In this decentralized framework, buyers can independently verify whether a dataset meets their requirements based solely on its content and quality metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively resolves the challenge of establishing data quality consensus in decentralized scenarios, enabling swift agreement between buyers and sellers on data quality. By doing so, it facilitates the circulation and trading of data assets, unlocking their value, and promoting economic growth. The findings provide a reliable and privacy-preserving data quality consensus mechanism for data transactions participants.",10.1109/JIOT.2025.3575580,H. Si; S. Wang; Y. Zhao; W. Chen; N. N.

"Financial Crimes in Web3-Empowered Metaverse: Taxonomy, Countermeasures, and Opportunities",2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7835811555510875,"At present, the concept of metaverse has sparked widespread attention from the public to major industries. With the rapid development of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the decentralized metaverse ecology has attracted a large influx of users and capital. Due to the lack of industry standards and regulatory rules, the Web3-empowered metaverse ecosystem has witnessed a variety of financial crimes, such as scams, code exploit, wash trading, money laundering, and illegal services and shops. To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse. The overview of this paper is expected to help readers better understand the potential security threats in this emerging ecology, and to provide insights and references for financial crime fighting.",10.1109/OJCS.2023.3245801,J.

A Dynamic-Efficient Structure for Secure and Verifiable Location-Based Skyline Queries,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6877340332442623,"In a broad range of commercial and government applications, supporting secure location-based query services over outsourced cloud-based services particularly for data update on encrypted datasets remains challenging in practice. Compounding the challenge is the need to ensure update and query efficiency, dataset confidentiality (including against potentially malicious cloud service providers) and query authenticity. Thus in this paper, we propose DynPilot, a novel solution for privacy-preserving verifiable location-based skyline queries over dynamic and encrypted data(sets). The key challenge is how to devise a ciphertext-based authenticated data structure (ADS) that not only protects the confidentiality of the dataset (including the verification phase), but also the effective maintenance of such a dataset. Moreover, to motivate the cloud into actively updating ADS, the digest of the raw dataset is stored in the blockchain due to its immutability and consensus mechanism where update cost is also considered. Therefore, we present a novel ADS (hereafter referred to as Dynamic-Efficient Secure and Verifiable Tree (DSV-tree)), designed to be dynamic and support secure and verifiable skyline queries. Meanwhile, DynPilot also achieves forward privacy using a novel fuzzy update strategy. To further improve the efficiency of queries, an optimized version (i.e., DSV*-tree) is also developed based on the idea of the multi-level index structure. Finally, we analyze the security and complexity of our approach, and the empirical evaluations demonstrate the utility of our approach.",10.1109/TIFS.2022.3224666,Z. Wang; L. Zhang; X. Ding; K. -K.

Federated Latent Dirichlet Allocation for User Preference Mining,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"In the field of Web services computing, a recent demand trend is to mine user preferences based on user requirements when creating Web service compositions, in order to meet comprehensive and ever evolving user needs. Machine learning methods such as the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have been applied for user preference mining. However, training a high-quality LDA model typically requires large amounts of data. With the prevalence of government regulations and laws and the enhancement of people's awareness of privacy protection, the traditional way of collecting user data on a central server is no longer applicable. Therefore, it is necessary to design a privacy-preserving method to train an LDA model without massive collecting or leaking data. In this paper, we present novel federated LDA techniques to learn user preferences in the Web service ecosystem. On the basis of a user-level distributed LDA algorithm, we establish two federated LDA models in charge of two-layer training scenarios: a centralized synchronous federated LDA (CSFed-LDA) for synchronous scenarios and a decentralized asynchronous federated LDA (DAFed-LDA) for asynchronous ones. In the former CSFed-LDA model, an importance-based partially homomorphic encryption (IPHE) technique is developed to protect privacy in an efficient manner. In the latter DAFed-LDA model, blockchain technology is incorporated and a multi-channel-based authority control scheme (MCACS) is designed to enhance data security.

Construction Industry 4.0 and Sustainability: An Enabling Framework,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Governments worldwide are taking actions to address the construction sector's sustainability concerns, including high carbon emissions, health and safety risks, low productivity, and increasing costs. Applying Industry 4.0 technologies to construction (also referred to as Construction 4.0) could address some of these concerns. However, current understanding about this is quite limited, with previous work being largely fragmented and limited both in terms of technologies as well as their interrelationships with the triple bottom line of sustainability perspectives. The focus of this article is therefore on addressing these gaps by proposing a comprehensive multi-dimensional Construction 4.0 sustainability framework that identifies and categorizes the key Construction 4.0 technologies and their positive and negative impacts on environmental, economic, and social sustainability, and then establishing its applicability/usefulness through an empirical, multimethodology case study assessment of the UAE's construction sector. The findings indicate Construction 4.0’s positive impacts on environmental and economic sustainability that far outweigh its negative effects, although these impacts are comparable with regards to social sustainability. On Construction 4.0 technologies itself, their application was found to be nonuniform with greater application seen for building information modeling and automation vis-à-vis others such as cyber-physical systems and smart materials, with significant growth expected in the future for blockchain- and three-dimensional-printing-related technologies. The proposed novel framework could enable the development of policy interventions and support mechanisms to increase Construction 4.0 deployment while addressing its negative sustainability-related impacts.

Automated Energy Transaction and Incentivization of Prosumers and Consumers through Smart Contracts,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9798099801830655,"World’s population is rapidly expanding, and so is the need for an uninterrupted power supply. Along with this, there is also a rapid rise in tech-savvy initiatives and industrialization. All these lead to an increase in the carbon footprint, thereby resulting in an increasingly polluted world. Most governments, regardless of their politics, are pledging to reduce their carbon emissions and shift to greener energy resources. Integrating renewable energy (RE) into the current energy system is a key step in that direction, but the existing energy infrastructure is incapable of incorporating RE sources and catering to the rising demands without technological interventions. Electricity obtained through RE is very volatile and subject to environmental conditions. In such a scenario, the RE alone would not be able to support the grid at peak demand times. Grid would need additional support in the form of demand response (DR). DR incentivizes consumers to reduce their electricity usage during peak demand, but calculating the real-time data of all the consumers and rewarding them becomes a hassle without smart, secure, and reliable communication and storage systems. Hence, to enhance participant trust and automate the entire DR process, blockchain and smart contracts (SC) are viable solutions due to their transparency and immutability.

The Blockchain Random Neural Network for cybersecure IoT and 5G infrastructure in Smart Cities,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.788043860776278,"5G promises much faster Internet transmission rates at minimum latencies with indoor and outdoor coverage in Smart Cities. 5G could potentially replace traditional Wi-Fi for network connectivity and Bluetooth technology for geolocation with a seamless radio coverage and network backbone therefore accelerating new services such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Although Wi-Fi 6 is already in the market designed for IoT applications. New Smart City applications based on Big Data will depend on 5G as a mobile Internet service provider therefore eliminating the need to deploy additional private network infrastructure or mobile networks. The benefits due to the expanded network access and enhanced connectivity between devices also intrinsically increase cybersecurity risks. Cyber attackers will be provided with additional digital targets; in addition, wireless and mobile network including the access channel infrastructure will be shared between independent services. To address these cybersecurity issues, this article presents the Blockchain Random Neural Network for Cybersecurity applications in a holistic digital and physical cybersecurity user and channel authentication methods. The user identity is kept secret as the neural weights codify the user information, although in case of cybersecurity breach, the confidential identity can be mined and the attacker identified.

Trust-based fog-blockchain model for scalable authentication in smart cities,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8535750065909852,"In smart cities, ensuring robust authentication, security, and scalability of infrastructure presents significant challenges. Traditional centralized authentication methods expose vulnerabilities and increase energy consumption, particularly in resource-constrained IoT nodes. Moreover, existing blockchain-based authentication systems encounter substantial overhead, delays, and complexities, compromising their effectiveness in diverse environments. A critical issue in real-time smart systems is the significant authentication delays caused by the high volume of requests processed by the blockchain. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative blockchain architecture that connects distributed fog servers for seamless IoT node authentication within smart-city networks. Our model integrates trust-based analyses, encompassing the behavior and data trust evaluations of the IoT at fog servers, to fortify security by detecting malicious nodes and tampered data early in the process. This process streamlines verification by reducing the influx of untrusted data during consensus, ensuring only the most reliable data advances for blockchain operations, and enhancing efficiency and reliability. This architecture guarantees data confidentiality and integrity through lightweight encryption and digital certification. It fosters scalability, seamless communication, and information sharing among smart city entities, facilitating internetwork node identification across a spectrum of smart systems. Performance assessment of the proposed model revealed notable improvements in computation cost, execution time, and power consumption.

The primary objectives are to enhance electric work for cost reduction and power quality enhancement. The structure utilizes remote switches to adjust the microgrid's power supply route to consumers, minimizing resistive power losses. Additionally, it integrates the mobile storage capabilities of electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance microgrid operations. The aging costs of battery for EVs are modeled using Wöhler curve.

The HealthChain Blockchain for Electronic Health Records: Development Study,2021,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.9507748848375518,"Background Health care professionals are required to maintain accurate health records of patients. Furthermore, these records should be shared across different health care organizations for professionals to have a complete review of medical history and avoid missing important information. Nowadays, health care providers use electronic health records (EHRs) as a key to the implementation of these goals and delivery of quality care. However, there are technical and legal hurdles that prevent the adoption of these systems, such as concerns about performance and privacy issues. Objective This study aimed to build and evaluate an experimental blockchain for EHRs, named HealthChain, which overcomes the disadvantages of traditional EHR systems. Methods HealthChain is built based on consortium blockchain technology. Specifically, three organizations, namely hospitals, insurance providers, and governmental agencies, form a consortium that operates under a governance model, which enforces the business logic agreed by all participants. Every peer node hosts an instance of the distributed ledger consisting of EHRs and an instance of chaincode regulating the permissions of participants. Designated orderers establish consensus on the order of EHRs and then disseminate blocks to peers. Results HealthChain achieves functional and nonfunctional requirements. It can store EHRs in a distributed ledger and share them among different participants. Moreover, it demonstrates superior features, such as privacy preservation, security, and high throughput. These are the main reasons why HealthChain is proposed. Conclusions Consortium blockchain technology can help to build new EHR systems and solve the problems that prevent the adoption of traditional systems.",10.2196/13556,"Xiao, Yonggang; Xu, Bin; Jiang, Wenhao; Wu, Yunjun"
Enhancing trust and collaboration: A reputation-driven mechanism for cross-chain IoT data sharing,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7903968968717676,"Cross-chain data sharing in the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a critical challenge due to the isolation of industry-specific blockchains and the lack of trust mechanisms between heterogeneous networks. This issue is particularly important as IoT data sharing enables cross-industry collaboration, unlocks data value, and fosters innovation in applications such as smart cities and intelligent transportation. Existing solutions, including notary mechanisms, side-chains, and relay chains, often suffer from centralization issues, limited scalability, or inadequate incentives for active participation, making them insufficient to address the dynamic and large-scale requirements of IoT ecosystems. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a reputation-based incentive mechanism for cross-chain data sharing, which integrates a main-subchain architecture with a two-stage notary group election algorithm based on evolutionary game theory. Additionally, a Stackelberg game is employed to model interactions between data producers and consumers, optimizing data pricing strategies and incentivizing trustworthy sharing. The proposed framework is evaluated through extensive simulations on a star-topology blockchain network, testing its scalability, fairness, and effectiveness. Results demonstrate that the mechanism not only mitigates centralization problems but also enhances trust, collaboration, and efficiency across heterogeneous blockchains, providing a robust foundation for IoT data-sharing applications.",10.1016/j.comnet.2025.111266,"Xiong, Runqun; Cheng, Jing; Pu, Jiahang; Dong, Xirui; Chen, Ciyuan; Xu, Zhuqing"

To solve these problems, this paper proposes a reliable and privacy-preserving distributed model for the transition to smart cities, emphasizing the integration of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and tidal power into the urban energy ecosystem. For this purpose, a distributed model-based two-dimensional multiplicative method (PDMM) and a design-based model have been developed as a fast method to solve energy problems in smart cities. The results will show that PDMM performs well in large-scale optimization problems. To protect data privacy, the method of secure data exchange is based on a modified acyclic graph based on blockchain.

Verification and Validation for data marketplaces via a blockchain and smart contracts,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6546123018549923,"Actual challenges with data in physical infrastructure include: 1) the adversity of its velocity based on access and retrieval, thus integration; 2) its value as its intrinsic quality; 3) its extensive volume with a limited variety in terms of systems; and finally, 4) its veracity, as data can be modified to obtain an economical advantage. Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).",10.1016/j.bcra.2022.100100,"Serrano, Will"

Traditional waste management systems are often inefficient, which leads to unnecessary trips, high operational costs, difficulties in tracking waste, and the inefficient use of resources. The proposed work aims to integrate real-time predictive analysis-based waste collection and disposal processes using federated learning with blockchain, overcoming the challenges specified. Initially, IoT sensors were installed in waste bins across different sites to monitor the depth of waste accumulated. Local edge gateways preprocess the collected data, which the random forest model analyzes to determine the bin status. The aggregated data is sent to a global model that predicts overall waste generation trends. Furthermore, the processed data is securely recorded on a blockchain network combined with smart contracts, accessed through a decentralized application called D-App, which gives real-time updates for scheduling waste collection, performs efficient communication with users and stakeholders to access real-time data to monitor bin status, and track waste collection trucks. As a result, the model predicts bin status with 99.25 % accuracy using an RF algorithm and blockchain helped achieve a user trust level by 95 %.

To address security challenges in D2D communication, Blockchain (BC) technology is utilized. Existing methods face issues like single-point failure attacks, high implementation costs, and data privacy concerns. This work aims to develop a secure and efficient authentication model leveraging BC technology and a Deep Q Network (DQN) for key generation to enhance IoT security in smart city applications. A novel authentication model, Deep Q Network-SecAuth (DQN-SecAuth), is proposed for secure D2D communication using BC. The model involves key entities such as the Registration Authority Center (RAC), blockchain, and IoT devices. The authentication process includes six stages: setup, registration, key generation, authentication, new device addition, and formal verification. In the key generation stage, the secret key is generated using a Deep Learning (DL) model named DQN. The proposed model also incorporates encryption, hash functions, Chebyshev polynomials, and XOR operations to ensure security. The DQN-SecAuth model achieved a minimum computational time of 9.525 s and memory usage of 42.897 megabytes (Mb), consensus delay of 0.420 s, energy consumption of 0.715 J, latency of 0.469 s, power consumption of 0.270 kW-hour (kWh), and throughput of 0.804 megabits per second (Mbps). The key novelty of this work is the use of a DQN for adaptive key generation, integrated into a BC-based authentication framework. This combination enhances security, reduces computational overhead, and outperforms traditional static key-generation and authentication methods in smart city IoT environments.",10.1016/j.engappai.2025.112141,"Chandran, K.

Cross-blockchain protocol for public registries,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7611042644344114,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a concept of the protocol for public registries based on blockchain. New database protocol aims to use the benefits of blockchain technologies and ensure their interoperability. Design/methodology/approach This paper is framed with design science research (DSR). The primary method is exaptation, i.e. adoption of solutions from other fields. The research is looking into existing technologies which are applied here as elements of the protocol: Name-Value Storage (NVS), Berkley DB, RAID protocol, among others. The choice of NVS as a reference technology for creating a database over blockchain is based on the analysis and comparison with two other similar technologies Bigchain and Amazon QLDB. Findings The proposed mechanism allows creating a standard database over a bundle of distributed ledgers. It ensures a blockchain agnostic approach and uses the benefits of various blockchain technologies in one ecosystem. In this scheme, blockchains play the role of journal storages (immutable log), whereas the overlaid database is the indexed storage. The distinctive feature of such a system is that in blockchain, users can perform peer-to-peer transactions directly in the ledger using blockchain native mechanism of user access management with public-key cryptography (blockchain does not require to administrate its database).

A blockchain-enabled private parking space allocation with improved parking space utilization,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9060334434274704,"With the rapid development of the world’s infrastructure, we are moving towards making cities smart, known as smart cities. To make smart cities sustainable, designing efficient solutions is needed to reduce traffic congestion due to the lack of parking spaces within the constrained land areas of many metropolitan city centres. Parking problems in urban areas can be reduced by sharing vacant private parking spaces with others. In this work, we propose a decentralized and shared private parking management system using blockchain, which helps private parking owners and users fulfil their demands without the involvement of central authority. The proposed parking allocation method assigns parking to a single user from multiple parking providers, but the requester does not need to relocate between different parking spaces. The proposed method significantly improves private parking space utilization compared to a state-of-the-art parking allocation system. Hence, the system satisfies more user requests and generates more profit for parking owners than the state-of-the-art parking allocation system. The proposed system is a winning strategy because it maximizes the utilization of private parking spaces for the entire community’s benefit and helps to reduce traffic congestion. Experiments conducted in the simulated environment validate the benefits of the proposed model and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art parking allocation system.

The convergence of Digital Twins and Distributed Ledger Technologies: A systematic literature review and an architectural proposal,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8099524844799195,"In recent years, the emerging Digital Twin (DT) technology is playing a key role in fostering the transition towards the Industry 4.0. DTs, representing virtual replicas of physical objects, products or processes established thanks to a bidirectional continuous flow of information between the physical and the virtual world, are currently adopted in multiple domains such as manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, energy, construction, smart cities and smart mobility, etc.. DTs live together with the physical system they replicate, receiving the same data and often triggering specific control actions that directly impact on the real system status. When dealing with DTs of complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), the data sources may be heterogeneous and untrustworthy, which requires the DT to be able to address security issues related to data in transit from/to the physical twin and data at rest. A possible way to address these data security issues consists in adopting Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) which provide several security guarantees on data through cryptographic hashing techniques. In this work, we present a three-fold contribution: (i) we discuss the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the state-of-the-art of the research related to the integration between DLT and Digital Twins, aimed at clarifying relevant aspects such as, among others, what is the favourite DLT choice in existing proposals or what is the type of DT-related information to store on-chain; (ii) leveraging the SLR results and other related research, we propose an architectural framework for the integration of DT and DLTs (more specifically, blockchains); (iii) we validate the proposed architecture by means of two proof-of-concept implementations leveraging different technological stacks and taking into account two different operational scenarios.

BLPCA-ledger: A lightweight plenum consensus protocols for consortium blockchain based on the hyperledger indy,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5104493520210568,"An examination of different distributed real-time applications operating on the blockchain platform is conducted. These applications can be broadly classified into three types: permissionless public, permissioned private, and consortium chains. In order for a decentralized network to function independently, consensus mechanisms are needed to facilitate the delivery of transactions and keep track of them in a ledger. But the fundamental idea behind Blockchain technology is the use of several consensus protocols, like Proof of Stake, Proof of Elapsed Time, etc., which requires greater processing power. In order to arrange transactions, it increases the demand for buying more computing units. Furthermore, present consortia blockchain consensus mechanisms lack a policy to collect socio-economic financial levies, including monies for charitable donations, education, and social activities. To collect socio-economic taxes, this study suggests a lightweight Plenum consensus algorithm called ""BLPCA"" for consortium blockchains built on Hyperledger Indy. The Byzantine Fault Tolerance concept combined with optimization is used in the suggested BLPCA systems to manage large-scale decentralized traffic of socioeconomic hierarchy. Because there are no transaction costs, BLPCA encourages government analysts to review funds using fewer resources. By including a multithreading heterogeneous technique, the BLPCA can effectively handle multi-transaction needs and execute this protocol in an industrial setting that operates in real-time. It is observed from the simulations that even in the worst-case network scenario—such as a fork—the suggested consortium blockchain does not crash a single transaction. In order to guarantee node scalability, a high propagation speed is determined. Furthermore, the BLPCA shows an excellent average time while constructing socioeconomic transaction blocks.",10.1016/j.csi.2024.103876,"Mehmood, Faisal; Khan, Abdullah Ayub; Wang, Han; Karim, Shahid; Khalid, Umara; Zhao, Feng"

Privacy-preserving data sharing scheme based on federated learning in Internet of Vehicles,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The continuous optimization and advancement of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology have significantly contributed to the development of smart cities and intelligent transportation systems. In IoV environments, efficient data interaction processes can be leveraged to analyze traffic congestion as well as to predict and prevent traffic accidents. Within this context, federated learning can be employed to facilitate secure data interaction and sharing. However, this inevitably introduces the risk of compromising the privacy of data providers, thereby diminishing their willingness to contribute data. Consequently, achieving secure data sharing while preserving user privacy has emerged as a critical research challenge in the IoV domain. To address this issue, this paper proposes an approach that integrates federated learning into IoV scenarios to enable privacy-preserving data sharing. Specifically, we first design a pairing-free matching algorithm to select suitable clients for federated learning. The selected data owners perform model training locally and share only the final trained model rather than the raw data, thus achieving data usability without sacrificing data confidentiality. Secondly, to address the privacy concerns associated with model updates in federated learning, we adopt an enhanced Paillier homomorphic encryption algorithm to encrypt the model parameters, which prevents information leakage while allowing aggregation in the encrypted domain. Thirdly, an improved Multi-Krum algorithm is integrated into a blockchain framework to filter out malicious models in their encrypted form, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the global model while decentralizing the aggregation process. Simulation results demonstrate that our client matching algorithm achieves faster matching speed and ensures the privacy of model updates without compromising the accuracy of the model training process.",10.1016/j.comnet.2025.111628,"Sun, Jin; Kang, Mengna; Sun, Zhongpeng"

GLSBIoT: GWO-based enhancement for lightweight scalable blockchain for IoT with trust based consensus,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8280947161858716,"Blockchain technology, which has gained much attention from researchers, faces challenges when applied to resource-constrained devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). These challenges include significant network overhead and energy-intensive processes. We propose a trust-based ensemble consensus and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm to address these limitations. The trust-based ensemble consensus leverages Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus procedures to improve trust levels within the network. To boost scalability and throughput without sacrificing the security and privacy of IoT data, we utilize sidechaining with the efficient GWO algorithm, allowing the construction of parallel chains connected to the main blockchain. Our experimental results outperformed conventional models by increasing throughput by 12.5% while decreasing mining delay by 19.5% and energy usage by 18.3%. The conducted security analysis reveals the presented lightweight framework is robust against Finney, DoS, Sybil, and Masquerade attacks.

"Blockchain in the built environment and construction industry: A systematic review, conceptual models and practical use cases",2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The construction industry is facing many challenges including low productivity, poor regulation and compliance, lack of adequate collaboration and information sharing, and poor payment practices. Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.",10.1016/j.autcon.2019.02.005,"Li, Jennifer; Greenwood, David; Kassem, Mohamad"

These sensors play a vital role across diverse aspects of the energy sector, ranging from producing energy to haggling with the complexities of the smart grid. The IoE sensors use fiber optics technology that increases the speed and bandwidth of data transfer in smart grid applications. Incorporating IoE sensors, including fiber optics, is paramount to rehabilitating extensive IoE sensor data into practical information to distribute energy based on prices, availability, and demand for smart homes and electric vehicles. However, from energy generation to consumption, many nodes are incorporated. Therefore, security is a crucial challenge to processing accurate IoE sensor data for energy generation and consumption in smart cities.

A framework for automating deployment and evaluation of blockchain networks,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8081951300790285,"A blockchain network is a distributed system established by mutually distrusting participants to operate a blockchain, enabling them to manage critical information such as account balances or asset ownership without a centralised third party. Blockchain network deployment and evaluation have become prevalent due to the emerging blockchain use cases by enterprises, governments, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which demand private blockchains rather than participating in public ones. A blockchain network architecture drives deployment and evaluation activities. Nevertheless, practitioners must learn and perform error-prone activities to transform architecture into a blockchain network and evaluate it. Therefore, it is beneficial to automate these activities so that practitioners can focus on the architecture design, a valuable and hard-to-automate activity. The key challenges of such an automation framework are keeping up with the advances in blockchain technologies and the increasing complexity of blockchain network architecture. This paper proposes NVAL, a software framework that implements a novel architecture-driven, community-supported approach to automate blockchain network deployment and evaluation. NVAL accepts blockchain network architecture as input. It supports complex multi-channel blockchain networks, an increasingly prevalent architecture for private blockchain. The framework keeps up with blockchain technologies by leveraging platform-specific automation programmes developed by a practitioner community via runtime composition to handle new networks. We evaluated NVAL with a case study and showed that the framework requires only seven automation programmes to deploy 65 blockchain networks with 12 diverse architectures and generate 295 evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it consumes only 95.5 ms to plan and orchestrate the deployment and evaluation, which is minuscule compared to the total time required for deploying and benchmarking a blockchain network.",10.1016/j.jnca.2022.103460,"Tran, Nguyen Khoi; Babar, M.

These applications rely on various services, such as communication and computation, provided by additional nodes within the smart city environment. However, these services are delivered by a diverse range of cloud computing-based servers that are widely spread and heterogeneous, leading to cybersecurity becoming a crucial challenge among these servers. Numerous machine-learning approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the cybersecurity challenges in heterogeneous transport applications within smart cities.

Blockchain technology can maintain a shared ledger among servers. In the Raft consensus mechanism, as long as more than half of the nodes remain operational, the system will not collapse, effectively maintaining the system’s robustness and security. To protect vehicle information, we propose a security framework that integrates the Raft consensus mechanism from blockchain technology with edge computing.

Blockchain-Enabled Framework for Cross-Sector Integration in Smart Cities Facilitating Risk Assessment and Interdependency Analysis,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8811314995976234,"The Smart City (SC) paradigm has been proposed to address the problem of fast urbanization and the worldwide motivation toward the realization of a set of globally agreed-upon sustainable development goals. However, the actual implementation of SCs faces several significant challenges: (1) managing the complex structures of interdependency that arise from cross-sector integration is a major challenge; (2) ensuring that sensitive data shared within an SC are safe and private; and (3) the availability of real-time risk and interdependency analysis instead of traditional offline modeling and simulation methods against the propagation of run-time failures such as cascade and feedback effects. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of research that focuses on cyber cross-sector integration and its mentioned consequences. To fill these research gaps, we suggest a blockchain-based framework called SCADA-NET for integrating different sectors within SCs. This is an important part of making SCs reliable and sustainably long-lasting on the basis of well-known algorithms from the Complex Networks Theory (CNT). A preliminary prototype for SCADA-NET was developed, and the details of its design, implementation, performance evaluation, and future improvements are provided and discussed in this paper. A consortium blockchain allows people to share data in a safe and open way, and CNT models complicated CI networks. This study revealed that these two tools can work effectively together to make cross-sector integration into SCs easy and long-lasting.

Existing blockchain-based IoT security solutions primarily rely on implicit trust to authenticate devices, leaving networks vulnerable to insider attacks, where pre-authenticated devices are compromised to gain unauthorized access. Moreover, the exponential growth in IoT devices exacerbates scalability bottlenecks, overwhelming traditional solutions. In this paper, we propose the Zero-Trust Blockchain-Enabled Framework for Scalable and Secure IoT Networks (ZT-BlocIoT), a comprehensive solution grounded in zero-trust principles, blockchain technology, and AI-based optimization.

A Lightweight Blockchain for IoT in Smart City (IoT-SmartChain),2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8670122857295115,"The smart city is a technological framework that connects the city’s different components to create new opportunities. This connection is possible with the help of the Internet of Things (IoT), which provides a digital personality to physical objects. Some studies have proposed integrating Blockchain technology with IoT in different use cases as access, orchestration, or replicated storage layer. The majority of connected objects’ capacity limitation makes the use of Blockchain inadequate due to its redundancy and its conventional processing-intensive consensus like PoW. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a NOVEL model of a lightweight Blockchain framework (IoT-SmartChain), with a lightweight consensus and a lightweight structure. The framework architecture presents a role hierarchy of connected objects according to their computational and storage capacity. This organization allows all things to be linked even indirectly via different interfaces and to benefit from the power of high-capacity objects such as Fog and Edge computing nodes. Data is validated and added to the blockchain ledger by running a lightweight consensus called Proof of Random Participation (PoRP), which reduces the blockchain nodes’ high computing power requirement. The TOPIC subscription-based data storage strategy called Assisted Selected Relevant Data in Local Ledger (ASRDLL) reduces the data size of a node’s local ledger and the entire network’s data size. This strategy is assisted by a centralized algorithm that optimizes the overall network size by adjusting the choice of TOPICS.

Amalgamation of blockchain and IoT for smart cities underlying 6G communication: A comprehensive review,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8465357585337143,"Nowadays, increasing urbanization has necessitated the social, environmental, and economic development of cities to enhance the Quality of Life (QoL) significantly and introduces the “Smart City” concept. It integrates Information and Communication Tools (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies to resolve urban challenges. The key goal is to make the most acceptable use of available resources and technologies to develop smart cities. An IoT-enabled application plays a crucial role here, but it has various security, privacy, latency, and reliability issues with a single-point-of-failure problem. The evolving technology blockchain can handle the aforementioned security and privacy issues and provide high-quality services due to several features like transparency, trust-free, decentralization, immutability, and others.

A consortium blockchain based energy trading scheme for Electric Vehicles in smart cities,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.842454655502433,"The real time Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading have ameliorated the smart city environment. Electric Vehicles (EVs) in smart cities have made it possible to balance the energy demand and supply without burdening the power grids. They also help in minimizing both the heap amounts of pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions. EVs not only charge their batteries from Charging Stations (CSs), but when the smart city faces energy deficiency, they supply their surplus energy to the power grids to fulfill energy demand as well. In addition, EVs also balance the energy demand and supply through energy trading at the local level during peak hours, which strengthens V2V energy trading. However, some issues, such as security threats and privacy leakage prevent EVs from participating in the energy trading process. In addition, the lack of incentives and knowledge about the cost of reaching the energy trading place within minimum time are also big challenges. Therefore, to solve the aforementioned challenges, a secure and efficient scheme for V2V and V2G energy trading is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme also helps in promoting environmental friendliness and making the smart cities sustainable and reliable. In the proposed scheme, energy trading transactions are secured using consortium blockchain, wherein the Local Aggregators (LAGs) are selected as authorized nodes. LAGs perform their role as energy brokers and are responsible for validating the energy trading requests using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. Moreover, a solution to find accurate distance with required expenses and time to reach the charging destination is also proposed, which effectively guides EVs to reach the relevant CSs and encourages energy trading. Besides, we propose a fair payment mechanism using a smart contract to avoid financial irregularities. An incentive provisioning mechanism is also given in the proposed work to prevent EVs from acting selfishly. The efficient power flow having minimized losses in the vehicular network is of much importance. Therefore, the energy losses incurred in both V2G and V2V are discussed in this work. Furthermore, Oyente is used for smart contract’s security analysis and for testing Ethereum’s resilience against different security flaws. Two attacker models are proposed and the security analyses of the models are also provided. The analyses show that the proposed system is robust against the double spending and Sybil attacks.

It finds wide applications, especially in distributed environments, where entities such as wireless sensors need to be certain of the authenticity of the server. As contemporary blockchain techniques that address post-quantum concerns have not been designed, in this study, we investigate a blockchain in the post-quantum setting and seek to discover how it can resist attacks from quantum computing. In addition, traditional proof of work (PoW)-based consensus protocols such as Bitcoin cannot supply memory mining, and the transaction capacity of each block in a blockchain is limited and needs to be expanded. Thus, a new post-quantum proof of work (post-quantum PoW) consensus algorithm for security and privacy of smart city applications is proposed. It can be used to not only protect a blockchain under a quantum computing attack compared to existing classical hash-based PoW algorithms but also to supply memory mining.

The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm.

The framework leverages the provable Monero’s blockchain to endow two privacy requirements: (i) unlinkability between the payer’s address and the payee’s address and (ii) the non-traceability of the transaction sources. Moreover, two PKCs in the blockchain guarantee the benefits of sensing data participants theoretically.

Blockchain-Based Robust Data Security Scheme in IoT-Enabled Smart Home,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The recent surge in development of smart homes and smart cities can be observed in many developed countries. While the idea to control devices that are in home (embedded with the Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices) by the user who is outside the home might sound fancy, but it comes with a lot of potential threats. There can be many attackers who will be trying to take advantage of this. So, there is a need for designing a secure scheme which will be able to distinguish among genuine/authorized users of the system and attackers. And knowing about the details of when and what IoT devices are used by the user, the attacker can trace the daily activities of user and can plan an attack accordingly. Thus, the designed security scheme should guarantee confidentiality, anonymity and un-traceability. Most of the schemes proposed in the literature are either non-blockchain based which involves inherent problems of storing data in a single-server or assuming weaker attack models. In this work, we propose a novel scheme based on blockchain technology, assuming a stronger Canetti and Krawczyk (CK)-threat model. Through the formal and informal security, and comparative analysis, we show that the proposed scheme provides a superior security and more functionality features, with less communication cost and comparable computational cost as compared to other competent schemes. Moreover, the blockchain based simulation study on the proposed scheme has been conducted to show its feasibility in real-life application.",10.32604/cmc.2022.025660,"Vangala, Anusha; Das, Ashok Kumar; Park, YoungHo; Jamal, Sajjad Shaukat"
Tiger Tally: A secure IoT data management approach based on redactable blockchain,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9322564547835618,"Blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) data management is increasingly ubiquitous across smart cities, supply chains, e-health and other domains. The immutability of blockchain is crucial to securing these IoT data management systems. In actual application scenarios, redacting the on-chain IoT data is still desired or even legally required. Various redactable blockchain technologies have been suggested for breaking immutability and redacting on-chain data. However, conventional redactable blockchain technologies incur security and performance degradations like redact privileges abuse and key exposure, prior art merely reactively corrects rather than fundamentally forestalling such misuse. In this paper, we rethink the conflict between the immutability and redaction of blockchain-based IoT data systems and propose Tiger Tally as a secure redactable architecture to fundamentally forestall these vulnerabilities. Tiger Tally introduces a novel Targeted Policy-Based Chameleon Hash, along with tokenized redact privileges, to form integrated cryptography and access control mechanisms. We further propose a full lifecycle redactable blockchain framework with rigorous security proofs to instantiate Tiger Tally. Furthermore, to meet its practical needs, we introduce the proposed Tiger Tally to the comprehensive IoT data workflows. At last, proof-of-concept implementation and performance evaluation demonstrate that our Tiger Tally is practical for IoT data management systems and greatly reduces the time overhead caused by malicious modification by at least 73.0% or even 3.26 times at the cost of 5.4% incremental space overhead.",10.1016/j.comnet.2024.110500,"Zhao, Liushun; Guo, Deke; Luo, Lailong; Xie, Junjie; Shen, Yulong; Ren, Bangbang"

When a data breach occurs, it is difficult for the data owner to trace the identity of the data leaker. To address this challenge, we propose an Efficient and Traceable IoT Data Sharing method (ETDS), which strives to solve the accountability problem of IoT data in multiparty sharing scenarios. The ETDS consists of a blockchain-based decentralized access control system and a commutative encryption and fingerprint system. ETDS not only implements data access authorization in a decentralized environment but also implements an efficient accountability mechanism for data leakages. Unlike other accountability solutions, the data accountability mechanism of ETDS is implemented in scenarios where the data and the applications are decoupled.

The stability of these networks is based on stable and secure data transmission without any vulnerabilities present used devices. Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks have brought critical interruptions in IoT services and significantly damage the network. In DDoS attacks, attackers utilize botnets, with the capability of frequently exploiting the millions of IoT devices around the globe. After the source code of Mirai malware is loaded on GitHub, the threats are significantly increased. Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is an embedded software standard for IoT device makers to advertise device specifications, including the intended communication patterns when it connects to the network. Even though the MUD mechanism is promising exertion, still there is a need for evaluating its viability, recognize its limits, and upgrade its architecture to reduce shortcomings in its architecture as well as to increase its effectiveness. This standard neither identifies the vulnerability path before the creation of the MUD profile. Thus, it is possible to exploit an IoT device even after the MUD profile is issued to the device by manipulating the vulnerabilities in the device. By keeping in mind this situation, this paper discusses the limitations of MUD in detail and proposed a framework to identify the patch and default vulnerabilities by using blockchain method before the generation/creation of MUD profiles.

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.

However, the traditional centralized processing approach may face threats in terms of data leakage and trust. The use of distributed, tamper-proof blockchain technology can improve the decentralized storage and security of data in the ITS network. However, the cross-trust domain devices, terminals, and transportation agencies in the heterogeneous blockchain network of the ITS still face great challenges in trusted data communication and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous cross-chain interaction mechanism based on relay nodes and identity encryption to solve the problem of data cross-domain interaction between devices and agencies in the ITS. First, we propose the ITS cross-chain communication framework and improve the cross-chain interaction model. The relay nodes are interconnected through LibP2P to form a relay node chain, which is used for cross-chain information verification and transmission. Secondly, we propose a relay node secure access scheme based on identity-based encryption (IBE) to provide reliable identity authentication for relay nodes. Finally, we build a standard cross-chain communication protocol and cross-chain transaction lifecycle for this mechanism. We use Hyperledger Fabric and FISCO BCOS blockchain to design and implement this solution, and verify the feasibility of this cross-chain interaction mechanism.

Various mechanisms for detecting security attacks that rely on centralized and distributed architectures have already been proposed, but they tend to be inefficient due to such problems as storage constraints, the high cost of computation, high latency, and a single point of failure. Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire IoT network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized security architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) coupled with a blockchain technology for IoT network in the smart city that relies on the three core technologies of SDN, Blockchain, and Fog and mobile edge computing in order to detect attacks in the IoT network more effectively. Thus, in the proposed architecture, SDN is liable to continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic data in the entire IoT network in order to provide an optimal attack detection model; Blockchain delivers decentralized attack detection to mitigate the “single point of failure” problem inherent to the existing architecture; and Fog and mobile edge computing supports attack detection at the fog node and, subsequently, attack mitigation at the edge node, thus enabling early detection and mitigation with lesser storage constraints, cheaper computation, and low latency.

Since crowdsensing relies on user equipment to consume resources to obtain information, and the quality and distribution of user equipment are uneven, crowdsensing has problems such as low participation enthusiasm of participants and low quality of collected data, which affects the widespread use of crowdsensing. This paper proposes to apply the blockchain to crowdsensing and solve the above challenges by utilizing the characteristics of the blockchain, such as immutability and openness. An architecture for constructing a crowd-sensing incentive mechanism under distributed incentives is proposed. A multi-attribute auction algorithm and a k-nearest neighbor-based sensing data quality determination algorithm are proposed to support the architecture. Participating users upload data, determine data quality according to the algorithm, update user reputation, and realize the selection of perceived data. The process of screening data and updating reputation value is realized by smart contracts, which ensures that the information cannot be tampered with, thereby encouraging more users to participate. Results of the simulation show that using two algorithms can well reflect data quality and screen out malicious data. With the help of blockchain performance, the architecture and algorithm can achieve decentralized storage and tamper-proof information, which helps to motivate more users to participate in perception tasks and improve data quality.",10.32604/cmc.2023.034993,"Wang, Jiaxing; Rui, Lanlan; Yang, Yang; Gao, Zhipeng; Qiu, Xuesong"

A sobering outlook is crucial because misleading concepts may bury the whole idea of blockchain use. This paper aims to research the possibilities of blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and applicability of these technologies for different purposes in real estate, property rights and public registries. Design/methodology/approach This research is framed with policy studies and focuses on property rights, land registration regulatory framework and information and communication technologies innovations. The context of this paper is decentralization which has been developed in political science studies and the role of blockchain and DLT in it. Therefore, the provided analysis of blockchain and DLT is interdisciplinary research to interpret the facets of DLT technologies in the context of real estate and land title registration. Findings Permissioned and private DLT systems cannot be considered a significant evolutionary step in government systems. Blockchain, which is distinguished from permissioned systems as the technology of the immutable ledger that does not require authorities, is a new word in governance. However, this technology has some principal features that can restrain its implementation at the state level and thus require further research and development.

Blockchain-based cross-domain authorization system for user-centric resource sharing,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7052991285139417,"User-centric data sharing is essential to encourage citizens' active participation in the digital economy. One key to smart cities, a form of the digital economy, is the promotion of public use of citizen data. Nevertheless, it is not easy to utilize data without citizens’ consent. In this study, we took a technological approach to these issues. User-managed access (UMA) is a well-known framework for delegating resource access rights to others on the Internet. In UMA, authorization mechanisms are designed to be centralized so that resource owners can centrally manage access rights for various resources stored in different domains. However, the lack of transparency in the authorization mechanism is a barrier to its implementation in large-scale systems such as smart cities. In this study, we developed a blockchain-based cross-domain authorization architecture that enables a resource-sharing ecosystem in which organizations that wish to utilize data can freely trade with each other. The proposed architecture solves the transparency problem that conventional authorization systems have had by designing the authorization mechanism on blockchain technology. We implemented the proposed architecture as smart contracts and evaluated its processing performance. The resultant time required for delegating access rights and accessing resources was less than 500 ​ms. Furthermore, we found that the fluctuation in the processing time overhead was small. Based on these results, we concluded that performance degradation with the proposed architecture is minor.",10.1016/j.bcra.2023.100126,"Ezawa, Yuki; Kakei, Shohei; Shiraishi, Yoshiaki; Mohri, Masami; Morii, Masakatu"

BFSF: A secure IoT based framework for smart farming using blockchain,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9598551811344266,"Many smart applications, including smart cities, healthcare, smart agriculture, manufacturing, etc., have widely adopted the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart Farming (SF) integrates a set of technologies, such as cloud and edge computing and greenhouse concepts, to improve agricultural processes. Due to its capacity to generate fresh agricultural products at an incredible pace of development and output, the greenhouse business has recently attracted the attention of the farming community. However, the cost of labor and energy consumption causes the greenhouse’s production cost to rise by roughly 40%–50%. To avoid this, SF concepts have been introduced. Data management in SF has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its high potential for more accurate and cost-effective agriculture. Traditional client–server and cloud-based data management systems are plagued by single faults, data protection, centralized data management, and system vulnerabilities. In this paper, an IoT-based framework is proposed for SF to improve the productivity of crops. AI-based precision model is introduced in the framework, which can be integrated with remote sensor data for correct prediction of crop growth in smart agriculture. The result shows that the random forest model works better with 97% accuracy compared to Support Vector Classifier (SVC) have 93%, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) have 90%, and Logistic Regression 84%. This technology helps to reduce costs while also improving the overall quality of the agricultural process and product management with blockchain-based supply chain management to enhance farmers’ economic backdrop.

Fog-enabled private blockchain-based identity authentication scheme for smart home,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9390968565819573,"As the Internet of Things (IoT) technology continues to advance, it has found widespread application in various fields, including smart health, smart cities, and smart transportation. Among these applications, smart homes are particularly noteworthy due to their intimate connection to our daily lives. However, the use of smart devices in a home environment exposes users to various security threats, such as impersonation attacks and insider privilege attacks, as users must communicate with multiple devices through a public channel. Additionally, traditional authentication schemes that rely on trusted third-party present a single point of failure, as users and smart devices must be registered and authenticated by a central authority. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized, tamper-proof, and flexible solution for authentication and access control of data. By using blockchain, the single point of failure problem in traditional authentication schemes can be resolved. In the context of smart homes, the real-time nature of the environment necessitates the use of fog nodes to provide localized computing services. Fog nodes are closer to IoT devices than cloud nodes, making fog computing more efficient and faster than cloud computing. This paper proposes an authentication scheme for blockchain-enabled fog nodes in smart homes. The scheme involves registering all fog nodes and intelligent devices on a local private blockchain, and authentication is performed jointly by smart contracts on the blockchain and off-chain operations. The scheme provides comprehensive security and better performance, as demonstrated by security analysis and performance evaluation. Moreover, the proposed scheme offers a certain level of user privacy protection.",10.1016/j.comcom.2023.04.005,"Xu, Xianbin; Guo, Yajun; Guo, Yimin"
A blockchain-empowered crowdsourcing system for 5G-enabled smart cities,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8286686169361087,"With the development of 5G(5th generation mobile networks) technology, smart cities are an inevitable trend in modern city development. Among them, smart city services are the foundation of 5G-enabled smart cities. As an emerging and informational city service model, crowdsourcing has been widely used in our daily life. However, in the existing crowdsourcing systems, the requesters and the workers are usually required to use the crowdsourcing platform as the trust center, and the payment depends on the third-party central payment institutions, which have a massive security risk. Once these centers are attacked or do evil, it will bring higher losses to the crowdsourcing parties. These problems will negatively affect the further development of 5G-enabled smart cities. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-empowered and decentralized trusted service mechanism for the crowdsourcing system in 5G-enabled smart cities. In the proposed mechanism, the crowdsourcing service process is divided into nine stages: initialization, task submission, task publication, task reception, scheme submission, scheme arbitration, payment, task rollback, and service compensation. The smart contract controls the execution of each step in each stage, and the payment is completed by blockchain without the involvement of third-party central institutions. Finally, we develop smart contracts to conduct experiments based on Ethereum and compare it with the existing crowdsourcing system. The experimental results show the effectiveness and applicability of the crowdsourcing system service mechanism without the central institutions.",10.1016/j.csi.2021.103517,"Tan, Liang; Xiao, Huan; Yu, Keping; Aloqaily, Moayad; Jararweh, Yaser"

The study identifies key elements associated with the incorporation of green spaces and smart technologies within smart cities. The findings show that green spaces can promote environmental sustainability in smart cities when utilized as renewable energy sources, natural filters, and public spaces. However, effectively managing green spaces requires the implementation of smart technologies such as sensors to monitor and analyze data on factors such as air pollution, temperature, and irrigation levels. The study evaluates the challenges of green space data analysis such as cost, data reliability, privacy, and expertise, and reveals that Western and Eastern cities take different approaches to green space data analysis, focusing on environmental/social and urban planning benefits respectively. The importance of technologies and policies aimed at addressing environmental issues in disadvantaged communities, including air pollution, is emphasized. Effective strategies such as the deployment of air quality sensors, green infrastructure, and transit-oriented development can improve air quality and health, though success depends on policy design, resources, and infrastructure.

Considering the quick growth of this technology and the high number of published documents in recent months, there is a need to catalog the different methodologies, proposed by the various scholars. Our aim is to detect the current research trends and possible future challenges. In the agricultural context, the need for an adequate traceability system is motivated by several bad habits and problems, such as the wide use of pesticides and fertilizers in fruits and vegetables, which are extremely harmful for human health. Moreover, in the last few years, the consumers’ attention about the quality of agricultural products has considerably increased. The present study shows that the blockchain technology is still in its early stage. Although there are several proposals in the literature, still a limited number of applications have been put into use in the real context. From the point of view of scientific research, only some countries are investing in this technology: China and United States are among the most active, but Italy is also very involved in this phenomenon. Overall, the blockchain technology appears very promising, but still many efforts are needed to reach the maturation stage.",10.1016/j.promfg.2020.02.054,"Mirabelli, Giovanni; Solina, Vittorio"

Blockchain-based authentication and authorization for smart city applications,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7637000448713689,"The platforms supporting the smart city applications are rarely implemented from scratch by a municipality and/or totally owned by a single company, but are more typically realized by integrating some existing ICT infrastructures thanks to a supporting platform, such as the well known FIWARE platform. Such a multi-tenant deployment model is required to lower the initial investment costs to implement large scale solutions for smart cities, but also imposes some key security obstacles. In fact, smart cities support critical applications demanding to protect the data and functionalities from malicious and unauthorized uses. Equipping the supporting platforms with proper means for access control is demanding, but these means are typically implemented according to a centralized approach, where a single server stores and makes available a set of identity attributes and authorization policies. Having a single root of trust is not suitable in a distributed and cooperating scenario of large scale smart cities due to their multi-tenant deployment. In fact, each of the integrated system has its own set of security policies, and the other systems need to be aware of these policy, in order to allow a seamless use of the same credentials across the overall infrastructure (realizing what is known as the single-sign-on). This imposes the problem of consistent and secure data replicas within a distributed system, which can be properly approached by using the blockchain technology. Therefore, this work proposes a novel solution for distributed management of identity and authorization policies by leveraging on the blockchain technology to hold a global view of the security policies within the system, and integrating it in the FIWARE platform.

Thus, advances in blockchain technology are increasingly investigated as a viable digital technology to address such problems. This advantage has led to blockchain gaining significant traction within the AEC industry thus piquing the interests of researchers. Although prior reviews on blockchain have been well appreciated, those studies do not give a complete picture of blockhain in the AEC industry as a whole. For example, whereas some researchers focused their studies on the construction industry, others did so across multiple domains. And researchers who attempted to review blockchain in the AEC industry employed a qualitative methodology which have been criticized for its lack of reproducibility and susceptibility to subjective biases. Moreover, those studies which utilized a quantitative approach employed a single science mapping tool for its analysis, which did not meet the criteria for a robust science mapping research. Therefore, there is the need for further review research efforts to supplement the limitations of the previous works. Thus, this study presents a robust science-mapping based analysis of the state-of-the art research on blockchain technology in the AEC industry, by combining three scientometric tools to analyze quantitatively, 12,549 relevant bibliographic data retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database.

PPFchain: A novel framework privacy-preserving blockchain-based federated learning method for sensor networks,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in many smart applications such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, industry, etc. In addition, the importance of IoT-based architectures has increased with the emergence of innovative technologies such as 5G networks and quantum computing. Electrochemical sensors (ECS) have recently been used in IoT-based architectures thanks to their easy integration into smart systems in many fields such as pharmaceutical, food, medical diagnosis, clinical, genetic analysis, wearable, forensic identification, and monitoring of environmental variables. However, Although IoT-based systems have ensured the availability of sensor data in traditional architecture, there are many challenges, such as low latency, availability, real-time data traceability, and security.

PP-MAD: Privacy-preserving multi-task data aggregation in mobile crowdsensing via blockchain,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8193482016334671,"In smart city, multi-task data aggregation has become a key method for extracting useful information from massive sensing data generated by concurrent mobile crowdsensing tasks from multiple task requesters. In such multi-requester and multi-task scenario, each task requester wants to protect the privacy of their own aggregation results. Thus, protecting privacies of both workers and task requesters pose a significant challenge for multi-task data aggregation. Most existing privacy-preserving data aggregation methods focus on single-requester scenarios. When applied to multi-task and multi-requester aggregation, existing methods are inefficient due to completing repeatedly each task and fail to safeguard the privacy of each task requester. Additionally, existing multi-task data aggregation schemes do not support multiple types of aggregation. To tackle these challenges, we propose PP-MAD, a multi-type and privacy-preserving multi-task data aggregation scheme based on blockchain for mobile crowdsensing. PP-MAD is able to aggregate multiple concurrent tasks from multiple task requesters, and it supports many types of data aggregation, including sum, mean, variance, weighted sum, weighted mean. Moreover, PP-MAD ensures privacies of workers’ data and aggregation results of each task requester, even under collusion attacks.

Technology-enabled financing of sustainable infrastructure: A case for blockchains and decentralized oracle networks,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9203382130877737,"The capital required to maintain infrastructure in good repair falls short globally. This is commonly referred to as the “infrastructure finance gap”. To address climate change, transitioning from conventional to sustainable infrastructure further imposes financing challenges. This study employs the Model approach to justify and predict how blockchain technologies can leverage infrastructure data to close the finance gap by introducing new financing mechanisms. A semisystematic literature review was carried out for infrastructure finance, sustainable infrastructure and smart cities finance mechanisms, as well as blockchains and oracles. Conventional infrastructure finance via debt and equity lacks benchmarks that reflect the risk-return characteristics of the asset class. Performance-based financing addresses this issue by integrating performance data in valuations. However, a lack of trust in data veracity remains. Blockchains provide trust and transparency in data and transactions. They utilize oracles to access off-chain information for on-chain decision-making. With smart contracts and decentralized oracle networks, a general approach is presented where data from internet-of-things inform on-chain transactions, delivering performance benchmarks that accurately reflect the risk-return characteristics in an infrastructure investment. Capital can then be more readily deployed, thus closing the finance gap.

Enhancing smart city operation management: Integrating energy systems with a subway synergism hub,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8258166590199167,"This paper is centered on establishing a secure framework for the optimal concurrent operation of a smart city, encompassing transportation, water, heat, electrical, and cooling energy systems. The studied smart city includes the microgrid, smart transportation system (STS), energy hub (EH) and smart grid. In this regard, a subway synergism hub (SSH) as a new non-energy system is added to the smart city with the aim of serving the subway's water, heat, electrical and cooling demands as well as diminishing the operation cost of the smart city. The EH within the SSH cooperated with a desalination unit is considered to supply the subway's stations water demand by using the sea water. The investigation of the optimal allocation of the SSH unit for reducing the cost of smart city operation is also conducted by introducing a novel intelligent priority selection (IPS) analytical algorithm. In comparison to common meta-heuristic algorithms for allocation problems, the accurate optimal solution can be found in low runtime by the IPS algorithm. To achieve an accurate model of the smart city, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based blockchain approach is provided which can enhance the data and energy exchanges security within the smart city. This research paper introduces a security framework deployed in a smart city setting to establish a secure platform for energy transactions. The findings validate the effectiveness of this model and highlight the value of the IPS method.

The fusion of IoT, ICT, and Smart Home delivers interactive solutions to reduce costs and resource consumption, enhance performance, and engage people's needs more virtually and proactively. A smart home has numerous advantages with the integration of emerging advanced technologies. Big data, centralization, data and resource allocation, security, and privacy issues persist as challenges in IoT-enabled Smart Home Networks.

Towards blockchain-enabled single character frequency-based exclusive signature matching in IoT-assisted smart cities,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.945109672044063,"With the increasing viability of Internet of Things (IoT), more devices are expected to be connected in a smart city environment. It can provide many benefits for people’s daily life, but is also susceptible to many security threats in practice. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), especially signature-based IDSs, are one of the most commonly adopted security mechanisms to safeguard various network environments like IoT-assisted smart city against cyber attacks. The process of signature matching is a key limiting factor for a signature-based IDS, and the exclusive signature matching (ESM) was designed based on the observation that most network packets would not match any IDS signatures. However, exclusive signature matching like the single character frequency-based ESM may be vulnerable to some attacks in a hostile environment. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we propose a blockchain-enabled single character frequency-based ESM, which can build a verifiable database of malicious payloads via blockchains. In the evaluation, we investigate the performance of our approach under flooding and character padding attacks in both a simulated and a real IoT network environment.

RON-enhanced blockchain propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.801090079844494,"Edge computing can serve latency-sensitive data generated by smart IoT devices in smart cities, which cannot be accommodated by cloud services. However, edge-enabled smart cities applications face many security issues such as massive centralization, vulnerability to tampering, and tracing difficulty. Blockchain, as an emerging ledger technology, can be a useful solution to these problems. However, due to network propagation delay, blockchain fork may occur in the network of edge-enabled smart cities at some time. It can lead to double payment attacks and damage data integrity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain network propagation mechanism based on the resilient overlay network (RON) for edge-enabled smart cities. Firstly, it reconstructs the networking mode between the blockchain nodes in smart cities based on RON so that the blockchain nodes can quickly detect the link state of the Internet in smart cities. The shortest path algorithm and policy routing are then applied to construct the propagation path between the blockchain nodes to optimize the Gossip propagation mechanism and enhance the QoS and QoE. Simulation results show that the RON-based blockchain network propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities is beneficial in terms of average route hop count, transmission success rate, routing overhead, average delay, and reduced fork probability.",10.1016/j.jisa.2021.102936,"Huang, Junjie; Tan, Liang; Li, Wenjuan; Yu, Keping"

Regulation as both enabler of technology use and global competitive tool: The Gibraltar case,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.865712575928647,"Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) such as Blockchain appear to have disruptive economic potential to traditional finance-sector and non-financial markets as the success of crypto currencies demonstrates. While traditional financial and securities markets are highly regulated, DLT transactions and exchanges have so far widely remained unregulated, which potentially poses major threats to individual investors and, via money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion, to society at large. Governments have been taking different approaches to monitoring and regulating the fledgling DLT provision arena. However, the small jurisdiction of Gibraltar, an affluent self-governed and self-financed British overseas territory with a population of 34,000 at the Southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula has taken a proactive approach.

A secured blockchain method for multivariate industrial IoT-oriented infrastructure based on deep residual squeeze and excitation network with single candidate optimizer,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.815631588873399,"IoT infrastructures have been growing in recent years across a variety of industrial applications in sustainable smart cities and communities, including smart manufacturing and smart industries.

With a distributed environment, CPS has experienced significant success in industrial applications and critical infrastructure. However, there are numerous difficulties in such an environment, including those related to scalability, centralization, communication latency, and security and privacy. Deep residual squeeze and excitation network (DRSEN) with Single Candidate Optimizer-based IoT-oriented infrastructure is used in this manuscript to address these challenges. Blockchain creates a distributed environment for CPS's communication phase, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) establishes protocols for data forwarding in network.

The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is a concrete solution. IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. Participants can address large amounts of data with IPFS and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures their content, without having to put the data itself on the chain. By combining blockchain with distributed storage, the supply chain system is fit to the industry of the next generation.

A novel architecture to identify locations for Real Estate Investment,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8027204287295244,"The identification of a favorable location for investment is a key aspect influencing the real estate market of a smart city. The number of factors that influence the identification easily runs into a few hundreds (including floor space area, crime in the locality and so on). Existing literature predominantly focuses on the analysis of price trends in a given location. This paper aims to develop a set of tools to compute an optimal location for investment, a problem which has received little attention in the literature (analysis of house price trends has received more attention). In previous work the authors proposed a machine learning approach for computing optimal locations. There are two main issues with the previous work. All real estate factors were assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables. To address this, in the current paper we propose a network structure to derive the relational inferences between the factors. However, solving the location identification problem using only a network incurs computational burden. Hence, the machine learning layers from the previous work is combined with a network layer for computing an optimal location with proven lower computational cost. A second issue is that the computations are performed on an online database which has inherent privacy risks. The online data, user information and the algorithms can be tampered through privacy breaches. We present a privacy preservation technique to protect the algorithms, and use blockchains to secure the identity of the user. This paper presents solutions to two interesting problems in the analysis of real estate networks: a) to design tools that can identify an optimal location for investment and b) to preserve the privacy of the entire process using privacy preserving techniques and block chains.",10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.09.008,"E, Sandeep Kumar; Talasila, Viswanath; Pasumarthy, Ramkrishna"
SURVIVOR: A blockchain based edge-as-a-service framework for secure energy trading in SDN-enabled vehicle-to-grid environment,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8155829006714549,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have transformed the smart transportation sector by providing diverse energy management solutions to the smart grid. Energy trading among EVs and charging stations (CS) in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) environment is one of the popular verticals in smart grid. However, processing the energy trading decisions at remote control centers lead to an increase in delay and network overhead. Apart from these issues, the security concerns while trading the energy in such an environment remain persistent. Therefore, to handle the aforementioned issues, this paper presents SURVIVOR: A Blockchain based Edge-as-a-Service Framework for Secure Energy Trading in software defined networking (SDN)-enabled V2G Environment. In the proposed framework, the energy trading decisions are processed closer to the location of EVs through edge nodes. Moreover, for securing the energy trading transactions, blockchain is used wherein the approver nodes are selected amongst all the present nodes on the basis of a utility function and are made responsible for validating the transactions. Once such nodes are selected, a consensus-based blockchain mechanism for secure energy trading in SDN-enabled V2G environment is presented. In this mechanism, edge nodes are responsible for generating proof-of-work puzzles. The proof-of-work is a unique hash value which is computed for each EV and the transactions for which the approver nodes compute the same proof-of-work for each EV are added in the blockchain. The complete scheme is backed by the SDN architecture to reduce the overall latency and increase the throughput of the smart transportation network. The results obtained prove that the proposed scheme is effective for trading the energy between EVs and CS while securing the underlying trading transactions using blockchain. Moreover, the communication and computation cost of the proposed scheme comes out to be small which proves that it can be used in real-world applications. The latency in the complete transportation sector is also greatly reduced by using the SDN-architecture.",10.1016/j.comnet.2019.02.002,"Jindal, Anish; Aujla, Gagangeet Singh; Kumar, Neeraj"
Public value creation through voluntary business to government information sharing enabled by digital infrastructure innovations: a framework for analysis,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7909211126158895,"Public value creation is traditionally considered as the citizens' collective expectations with respect to government and public services. Recent e-government literature indicates that what exactly constitutes public value in digital government is still debated. Whereas previous research acknowledges aspects such as co-production and the orchestration role of government in the context of public value creation, there is only a limited understanding of how public value is created by the interactions between government and business actors, and the role digital technologies play in that process. Furthermore, so far, research into public value creation processes is limited to specific services that aim to meet a specific goal; for a more complete view, an integrative perspective is required to address the multiplicity of goals. Societal challenges including climate change, sustainability, and the transition towards circularity will require governments to play a crucial role. Businesses are also transforming their vision by adding societal goals to their economic objectives and contributing to these societal challenges. This necessitates even more the need to explicitly consider the role of business in public value creation processes. In this paper we argue that there is a need to understand public value creation as an interactive process, involving both government and business actors. In this process, voluntary information sharing enabled by digital infrastructures has the potential to contribute to the value creation processes, but the increased complexity of digital technologies obscures the effects they can have on value creation. Therefore, we develop a framework that allows to reason about public value creation as an interactive process, involving government and businesses, facilitated by voluntary information sharing. The framework also allows to reason about how the technological design choices of the underlying digital infrastructure influence this value creation process. For the framework development, we use an in-depth case study from the domain of international trade. We analyze the interactions between customs authorities and supply chain actors for jointly creating public value related to revenue collection, as well as safety and security of goods entering the European Union, using business data made available via a global blockchain-enabled infrastructure.

However, creating safe and immediate payments and communications is the main challenge with the IoV, especially with Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I). To examine the application of Blockchain as middle-ware amongst diverse stakeholders of intelligent transportation systems, this paper provides an approach for establishing secure payment and communication in response to this problem. Neural synchronization is used to enhance communication security. The architecture under consideration makes used to create a system for allowing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) interactions and transactions. Additionally, the efficiency and resistance of the suggested systems against typical security assaults are qualitatively tested in this paper. The key issues of V2X connections, such as safety and centralization, were addressed by the suggested method, according to computational testing. In this study, we also assessed the proposed solution's most crucial characteristics, including memory and power use, modifiability, secrecy, consistency, authenticity, processing time, and affordability.

It has been mostly adopted by military, aviation, civil, and commercial sectors for audio and video surveillance. The communication and security challenges of UAV is well mentioned by researchers and organizations (defense) around the world, although many of the challenges remain unresolved (especially for sensitive and consumer-related applications). Moreover, the conventional network systems may not be very efficient in dealing with the dynamic requirements of UAVs. As the UAVs are generally deployed in tough environments and terrains, therefore it is quite essential to provide a strong and secure network.

A trusted proof mechanism of data source for smart city,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8200901981742462,"In smart city, technologies such as blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing tend to be integrated that promotes horizontal information exchange and multi-party cooperation. Large amounts of superior services can be provided by analyzing the information. However, lots of IoT devices generating the information do not have sufficient resources to resist malicious attacks so that the devices deliberately upload the tampered data, which reduces quality of service. To solve the problem, we propose a data source trusted proof mechanism based on the node security measurement and threshold ring signature method. The mechanism firstly judges whether a node is in a trusted domain based on the proposed Distributed Sub-domain Networking (DSN) method to reduce energy consumption and avoid single point failure. Then, it quantifies security value of the nodes in the trusted domain based on the proposed three-dimension security measurement method. Finally, it confirms authenticity of the nodes using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)-based threshold ring signature scheme.Simulation results show our proposed mechanism can distinguish all malicious nodes among trusted nodes, the loss rate of trusted nodes is reduced to less than 5% and the false report rate is reduced to less than 10%.",10.1016/j.future.2021.10.012,"Liu, Jianli; Gong, Bei; Wang, Qian"

Urban energy efficiency assessment models from an AI and big data perspective: Tools for policy makers,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9403866003290472,"Although energy efficiency is quite a cliché term, it is a topic that attracts an increasing attention the last decade, especially in the context of cities and as a means to address emerging challenges like sustainability and climate change. Several models have been introduced to conceptualize and calculate the urban energy system, and to demonstrate the variants that calibrate the local energy efficiency. Nevertheless, cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, electrical -and even autonomous- vehicles, smart building systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data etc. are growing within cities and question the identified urban energy efficiency, since they demand enormous amounts of power. In this regard, policy makers are concerned of the emerging technologies’ energy efficiency and their impact on the urban energy system and they attempt to introduce corresponding standards for their development.

A blockchain-based Roadside Unit-assisted authentication and key agreement protocol for Internet of Vehicles,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"A fundamental layer of smart cities, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can significantly improve transportation efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and traffic accidents. However, because of the vehicle and the RoadSide Units (RSU) use wireless channels for communication, the risk of information being leaked or tampered is highly increased. Therefore, secure and reliable authentication and key agreement protocol is the masterpiece of IoV security. As most of the existing authentication protocols pertain to a centralized structure and single Trusted Authority (TA) network model, all vehicles involved can only perform mutual authentication with one TA through the intermediate node RSU, and thus, the efficiency of these centralized authentication protocols is easily affected by TA’s communication and computing resource bottlenecks. In this article, a blockchain-based authentication and key agreement protocol is designed for the multi-TA network model, moving the computing load of TA down to the RSU to improve the efficiency of authentication. In addition, blockchain technology is used for multiple TAs to manage the ledger that stores vehicle-related information, which results in vehicles that can easily achieve cross-TA authentication. Both formal and informal security analysis and simulation results from ProVerif show that the proposed protocol is secure. Comparisons with other existing work show that the proposed protocol has less computational overhead, higher authentication efficiency, and can resist various common attacks.",10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.11.003,"Xu, Zisang; Liang, Wei; Li, Kuan-Ching; Xu, Jianbo; Jin, Hai"
Chaotic and Paillier secure image data sharing based on blockchain and cloud security,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Internet of Things (IoT) is a materializing technology that has considerable technical, social, and economic importance. The present day predictions for the influence of IoT are highly monumental. This is because data of any form is found to be predominant to the IoT paradigm, therefore serving different applications like smart home, smart city, healthcare, smart grid, smart farms, manufacturing, and so on. Hence, several heterogeneous sensors are said in existence to estimate different types of parameters and found to be useful for different users. In this paper, a secured image sharing method called a Blockchain Chaotic and Paillier Map-based Authentication (BC-PMA) to provide image data integrity and security by deploying a cloud computing environment is proposed. The BC-PMA method is split into three sections. First, registration of corresponding classes of images in the cloud server via blockchain is presented by employing the Cat Map Registration model. The second step involves the authentication process carried out by employing Paillier Map-based Authentication where validation is ensured via smart contracts. Finally, upon successful authentication, unique and separate classes of images are provided with the respective, therefore ensuring secured classes of image sharing between users in the cloud environment.

DAG block: Trust aware load balanced routing and lightweight authentication encryption in WSN,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7797758557919895,"A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a staple network architecture that can be widely used to support diverse of applications as smart cities, smart homes, etc. However, energy consumption and security was still a major concern. The blockchain is a potential solution for security provisioning in WSN. However, due to resource constraint nature of the WSN nodes the adoption of classic blockchain leads to high energy consumption, slow transaction processing and poor scalability. To overcome the above issues, we propose Directed Acyclic Graph-based Trust aware Load Balanced Routing (DAG-BTLBR). Initially, the sensor nodes are unequally clustered in an energy-efficient manner to reduce the hotspot problem using Emperor Penguin Colony (EPC) algorithm. After clustering, packets are transmitted through load-balanced routes in secure manner using Adaptive Neuro-based Dual Fuzzy (ANDual Fuzzy) system which reduces the energy consumption by selecting optimal secure routes. The sensor nodes are subjected to meet the security requirements (data integrity, and confidentiality) due to its resource constraint nature. For that, lightweight authentication encryption scheme is designed in which the lightweight encryption is implemented by XTEA with Chaotic Map algorithm, whereas message authentication is implemented by Blake-256 algorithm. Finally, DAG based blockchain is utilized to improve the scalability and resiliency. The proposed DAG-BTLBR model is simulated and implemented using NS3 (version 3.26), and compared with existing works in terms of validation metrics such as end-to-end delay, time consumption, packet loss rate, and energy consumption, maximizing the throughput. The experimental results shows that the proposed work outperforms better than the existing works.",10.1016/j.future.2022.10.011,"M., Revanesh; Acken, John M.; Sridhar, V."
SocialBlock: An architecture for decentralized user-centric data management applications for communications in smart cities,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7962313393387572,"Smart city projects stand out for including a wide array of communication systems and heterogeneous technologies operated by multiple entities that collect data from citizens in very different ways. Basically, these projects involve three main actors that may have conflicting interests regarding the ownership and exploitation of the generated data: public administrations, service providers and citizens. Nevertheless, this is not a new problem. Actually, the most popular communication systems on the Internet, such as social networks, often have issues of this kind that can become highly visible in the press, especially when service providers, who commonly store data generated by their users via centralized models, have a security issue leading to a massive data leak, or when providers take advantage of their dominant position to exploit data improperly or sell it to third parties. This paper proposes an architecture to create user-centric data management applications for communications in smart cities where data is stored and managed in a decentralized way to reduce dependency on service providers and return control of the data to the different actors involved in the communications. In this paper, a proof of concept of the proposed architecture is implemented, using Ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as the main tools, to demonstrate its feasibility, show concrete protocols, and discuss the proposal on an empirical basis.",10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.06.004,"Garcia-Font, Victor"

The tools reviewed are digital public services, crowdsourcing platforms, whistleblowing tools, transparency portals, distributed ledger technology, and artificial intelligence. We scrutinise the evidence both on ICTs’ anticorruption effectiveness and misuse for corruption. Drawing on the commonalities across technologies, we find that ICT can support anti-corruption by impacting public scrutiny in numerous ways: enabling reporting on corruption, promoting transparency and accountability, facilitating citizen participation and government-citizen interactions. However, ICT can also provide new corruption opportunities through the dark web, cryptocurrencies, or the misuse of technologies such as centralised databases.

DRBFT: Delegated randomization Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol for blockchains,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.44225195439637266,"Blockchain, as a potentially revolutionary technology, has been used in cryptocurrency to record transactions chronologically among multiple parties. Due to the fast development of the blockchain and its de-centralization, blockchain technology has been applied in broader scenarios, such as smart factories, supply chains, and smart cities. Consensus protocol plays a vital role in the blockchain, which addresses the issue of reaching consensus on transaction results among involved participants. Nevertheless, with the complexity of the network environment and growing amount of network users, the advance of blockchain is gradually restricted by the efficiency, security and reliability of consensus protocols. In this paper, we propose a delegated randomization Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol named DRBFT based on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the consensus procedure. Specifically, a random selection algorithm called RS is developed to cooperate with the voting mechanism, which can effectively reduce the number of nodes participating in the consensus process.

However, in such a manner, the private IoT data may be disclosed by the cloud server since the cloud server knows all the data stored in it. This paper, for the first time, proposes a decentralized secure mechanism based on the blockchain technique to store the important data generated in the IoT system. This mechanism effectively solves the data reliability, security and privacy issues that may be encountered in the conventional IoT-cloud system. Considering the defects of simplified payment verification used by light nodes in blockchain networks, this paper proposes an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) verification mechanism based on the RSA accumulator, which makes the computational complexity of light nodes to generate and verify the UTXO proof to be constant.

Online operations in a multichannel supply chain under service cost difference: The adoption of blockchain technology,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"E-commerce has been growing at an unprecedented rate over the last decade. Nowadays, products are sold either on online e-platforms or at traditional offline stores. Two online operation modes between suppliers and e-platforms are dominant: reselling and agency. We examine the supplier’s trade-offs for blockchain technology adoption in both online operation modes. There are two potential win–win scenarios in which the supplier and e-platform could mutually benefit. The advent of blockchain technology has not impacted the competition between online and offline channels or the selection of online operation modes. The decision of the supplier to adopt blockchain technology is also not contingent on the online operation mode. Blockchain adoption may lead to an increase in the wholesale price of products, but will not necessarily promote an increase in product demand. However, the supplier adopting blockchain technology produces an all-win effect, When the blockchain operational cost is low, all supply chain members’ attitudes toward blockchain adoption are aligned. When consumers’ trust in product information is lower, the relative effectiveness of adopting blockchain technology increases. Finally, we find that the government subsidy enables all supply chain members to achieve Pareto improvement, and supply chain coordination can be achieved through the provision of government subsidies.",10.1016/j.tre.2025.104170,"Li, Hui; Kannan, Devika; Xu, Qi"

Caught in the middle?,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8749884413649177,"Purpose Distributed trust technologies, such as blockchain, propose to permit peer-to-peer transactions without trusted third parties. Yet not all implementations of such technologies fully decentralize. Information professionals make strategic choices about the level of decentralization when implementing such solutions, and many organizations are taking a hybrid (i.e. partially decentralized) approach to the implementation of distributed trust technologies. This paper conjectures that while hybrid approaches may resolve some challenges of decentralizing information governance, they also introduce others. To better understand these challenges, this paper aims first to elaborate a framework that conceptualizes a centralized–decentralized information governance continuum along three distinct dimensions: custody, ownership and right to access data. This paper then applies this framework to two illustrative blockchain case studies – a pilot Brazilian land transfer recording solution and a Canadian health data consent sharing project – to exemplify how the current transition state of blockchain pilots straddles both the old (centralized) and new (decentralized) worlds. Finally, this paper outlines the novel challenges that hybrid approaches introduce for information governance and what information professionals should do to navigate this thorny transition period. Counterintuitively, it may be much better for information professionals to embrace decentralization when implementing distributed trust technologies, as hybrid models could offer the worst of both the centralized and future decentralized worlds when consideration is given to the balance between information governance risks and new strategic business opportunities. Design/methodology/approach This paper illustrates how blockchain is transforming organizations and societies by highlighting new strategic information governance challenges using our original analytic framework in two detailed blockchain case studies – a pilot solution in Brazil to record land transfers (Flores et al., 2018) and another in Canada to handle health data sharing consent (Hofman et al., 2018). The two case studies represent research output of the first phase of an ongoing multidisciplinary research project focused on gaining an understanding of how blockchain technology generates organizational, societal and data transformations and challenges. The analytic framework was developed inductively from a thematic synthesis of the findings of the case studies conducted under the auspices of this research project. Each case discussed in detail in this paper was chosen from among the project's case studies, as it represents a desire to move away from the old centralized world of information governance to a new decentralized one. However, each case study also represents and embodies a transition state between the old and new worlds and highlights many of the associated strategic information governance challenges. Findings Decentralization continues to disrupt organizations and societies. New emerging distributed trust technologies such as blockchain break the old rules with respect to the trust and authority structures of organizations and how records and data are created, managed and used. While governments and businesses around the world clearly see value in this technology to drive business efficiency, open up new market opportunities and create new forms of value, these advantages will not come without challenges. For information executives then, the question is not if they will be disrupted, but how. Understanding the how as will be discussed in this paper provides the business know how to leverage the incredible innovation and transformation that decentralized trust technology enables before being leapfrogged by another organization. It requires a change of mindset to consider an organization as one part of a broader ecosystem, and for those who successfully do so, this paper views this as a strategic opportunity for those responsible for strategic information governance to design the future instead of being disrupted by it. Research limitations/implications This paper presents a novel analytic framework for strategic information governance challenges as we transition from a traditional world of centralized records and information management to a new decentralized world. This paper analyzes these transitions and their implications for strategic information governance along three trajectories: custody, ownership and right to access records and data, illustrating with reference to our case studies. Practical implications This paper predicts a large number of organizations will miss the opportunities of the new decentralized trust world, resulting in a rather major churning of organizations, as those who successfully participate in building the new model will outcompete those stuck in the old world or the extremely problematic hybrid transition state. Counterintuitively, this paper argues that it may be much less complex for information executives to embrace decentralization as fast as they can, as in some ways the hybrid model seems to offer the worst of both the centralized and future decentralized worlds with respect to information governance risks. Social implications This paper anticipates broader societal consequences of the predicted organization churn, in particular with respect to uncertainty about the evidence that records provide for public accountability and contractual rights and entitlements. Originality/value Decentralized trust technologies, such as blockchain, permit peer-to-peer transactions without trusted third parties. Of course, such radical shifts do not happen overnight. The current transition state of blockchain pilots straddles both the old and new worlds. This paper presents a theoretical framework categorizing strategic information governance challenges on a spectrum of centralized to decentralized in three primary areas: custody, ownership and right to access records and data. To illustrate how decentralized trust is transforming organizations and societies, this paper presents these strategic information governance challenges in two blockchain case studies – a pilot Brazilian land transfer recording solution and a Canadian health data consent sharing project. Drawing on the theoretical framework and case studies, this paper outlines what information executives should do to navigate this thorny transition period.",10.1108/RMJ-09-2019-0048,"Lemieux, Victoria L.; Rowell, Chris; Seidel, Marc-David L.; Woo, Carson C."
A blockchain-based secured system using the Internet of Medical Things (IOMT) network for e-healthcare monitoring,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.80739013452861,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded because of the development of information technology. IoT impacts several fields, including the medical profession, smart cities, and data management. The development of sustainable medical systems is significantly aided by the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). IoMT has a big impact on healthcare since it makes it easier to monitor and validate data about patients before storing it in the cloud. Keeping all data confidential and secured is essential since the IoMT is a big-data platform that is expanding quickly.This paper will apply this technical advancement to the realm of health, namely e-health. The research provides an IoMT-based monitoring tool for personal health surveillance. Block chain technology may resolve present interoperability issues in health-related systems and offer technological solutions that allow the electronic transfer of medical records to medical organizations and medical specialists. However, the transmission and security of people's health data remain a major concern in IoMT devices across a wide range of product categories. This research uses block chain as a secure solution to satisfy the requirements of medical privacy and data security. In this study, a Block chain-based IoMT security System (BC-IoMT-SS) is presented based on BC technology in IoMT for the security, privacy, and management of patient information. The suggested framework is successfully implemented to fulfill the optimal privacy and safety criteria for medical data management in IoMT gadgets. Utilizing the block chain's key, a healthcare application system has been created in which the person's health data may safely generate alerts for verified healthcare practitioners. Simulation results demonstrate that the suggested BC-IoMT-SS technique produces a high precision ratio of 94%, an efficiency ratio of 94%, a shorter delay of 0.63s, and a shorter reaction time compared to other current methods.",10.1016/j.measen.2023.100904,"Lodha, Lokesh; Baghela, Vishwadeepak Singh; Bhuvana, J.; Bhatt, Rahul"
Web3-DAO: An ontology for decentralized autonomous organizations,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7654360316497936,"Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions.

Understanding decentralized civic engagement: Focus on peer-to-peer and blockchain-driven perspectives on e-participation,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8421484032197623,"Decentralized civic engagement, i.e. engagement which is not initiated and managed by government, has been often used as a popular slogan in various public speeches to highlight the importance of genuine civic interests in governance, yet offering very limited options on how to actually promote such involvement. The advent of the digital era has facilitated the development of a plethora of digital participatory platforms that could presumably help to boost the effective engagement of civic communities in decision making processes in an explicitly decentralized manner and, more so, the demand for such decentralized e-participation services is increasing during the current Covid-19 crisis. However, there is a real shortage of studies that directly focus on the analysis of such autonomous cases and all the more so from real life contexts in their natural settings.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative tripartite evolutionary game model integrating prospect theory for the government, enterprises and the public. The model delves into the application of blockchain technology in the carbon trading market and its impact on participants' strategic choices. Additionally, a penalty mechanism based on blockchain is introduced to curb source data quality issues, considering the influence of decision-maker psychology on strategy selection. Simulation analyses reveal various factors affecting the stability of each party's strategy options, including carbon price, blockchain construction cost, enterprise lying penalties, integrity gains and the public rewards. Our findings highlight that the government's initial willingness to apply blockchain, carbon pricing, penalty enforcement, and public participation significantly influence the strategic decisions of all parties involved.

Blockchain Driven Metaheuristic Route Planning in Secure Wireless Sensor Networks,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8014315504789734,"Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) has been developed into a field of research and it purposes at linking many sensors enabling devices mostly to data collection and track applications. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a vital element of IoT paradigm since its inception and has developed into one of the chosen platforms for deploying many smart city application regions such as disaster management, intelligent transportation, home automation, smart buildings, and other such IoT-based application. The routing approaches were extremely-utilized energy efficient approaches with an initial drive that is, for balancing the energy amongst sensor nodes. The clustering and routing procedures assumed that Non-Polynomial (NP) hard problems but bio-simulated approaches are utilized to a recognized time for resolving such problems. With this motivation, this paper presents a new blockchain with Enhanced Hunger Games Search based Route Planning (BCEHGS-RP) scheme for IoT assisted WSN. The presented BCEHGS-RP model majorly employs BC technology for secure communication in the IoT supported WSN environment. In addition, an effective multihop route planning approach was designed by the use of EHGS technique. The proposed EHGS technique is derived from the concept of Hill Climbing strategy (HCS) and HGS algorithm. Moreover, a fitness function with two parameters namely residual energy (RE) and inter-cluster distance to elect optimal routes.

Subtraction of Hyperledger Fabric: A blockchain-based lightweight storage mechanism for digital evidences,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.739337766171853,"After more than ten years of development, the application of blockchain has expanded beyond the financial field to include other sectors such as E-government and the medical field. One of the most renowned blockchain platforms is Hyperledger Fabric, which is widely adopted by existing works for managing digital evidences (DEs). However, these works overlook the distinct differences between DEs and token-transfer transactions and often adopt the full implementation of Hyperledger Fabric, leveraging chaincode to manage the hash of DEs while keeping the original data off-chain to conserve storage resources. This approach poses challenges such as off-chain data loss, reduced data verification efficiency, and increased resource consumption. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight storage mechanism called Blockchain Zhengju Keeper (BZK) that addresses these issues. In BZK, we subtract Hyperledger Fabric by (1) modifying the endorsement policy to reduce the risk of off-chain data loss, (2) simplifying the DE upload-onchain process while keeping the parallel execution, and (3) abandoning chaincode for DE verification to reduce latency. Comprehensive simulation experiments demonstrate the practicality of the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, compared to Hyperledger Fabric, BZK can reduce storage resource consumption by 68% and lower verification latency by 97%.",10.1016/j.sysarc.2024.103182,"Fu, Xiang; Ma, Haoliang; Ding, Bo; Wang, Huaimin; Shi, Peichang"

In this paper, we propose a flexible and Ethereum-based scheme to facilitate copyright protection in data sharing blockchain, by using watermark-based policies. This allows us to achieve properties such as preventing the re-selling of data (e.g., partial data, combined data, and leaked data). We also design five algorithms to automatically guarantee data sharing fairness and proactively protect data copyright, by using smart contracts. In other words, several new security features are introduced to existing transaction schemes, while still achieving feasible performance.

BEST: Blockchain-based secure energy trading in SDN-enabled intelligent transportation system,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8072136756211977,"Tactile Internet is a fairly recent technological trend associated with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, with potential applications in a broad range of industrial, societal and business use cases. The real-time machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions (e.g., in unmanned vehicles and the underpinning infrastructure within the smart city ecosystem) in the intelligent transportation sector, for example, contribute to the potential utility of Tactile Internet in this particular sector (and the broader smart city). In the context of unmanned vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and electric (ground) vehicles, one of several key challenges to its broader utility is how to design a secure energy trading ecosystem that can be used for purposes such as charging and discharging from the supporting smart grids. Most existing approaches in the literature focused on conventional and centralized security mechanisms, which may not be applicable for energy trading in a smart city environment. Moreover, the need for real-time processing for energy trading computation is one of the essential requirements of Tactile Internet. Therefore, to address these challenges, BEST: a Blockchain-based secure energy trading scheme for electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, in BEST, blockchain is used to validate EVs’ requests in a distributed manner; thus, ensuring resilience against the single point of failure. The miner nodes are selected to validate the requests on the basis of energy requirements, time of stay, dynamic pricing, and connectivity record, as well as other factors that are crucial for the operator at the time of operation. Moreover, to provide low latency and real-time services, software-defined networking is used as the network’s backbone to transfer EVs’ requests to a global software defined network controller. Finally, BEST is evaluated on the basis of the communication and computation costs incurred during various transactions between the EVs and the smart grid. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the potential deployment of BEST in energy trading.",10.1016/j.cose.2019.05.006,"Chaudhary, Rajat; Jindal, Anish; Aujla, Gagangeet Singh; Aggarwal, Shubhani; Kumar, Neeraj; Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond"

An evolutionary game model is used to study the evolution process of behavioral strategies of each entity within the trading model system. This article examines five factors that significantly influence the evolutionary equilibrium: government subsidies, blockchain construction, and maintenance costs, players’ willingness, the losses that players may suffer from not participating in blockchain, and the energy requirements for hydrogen production. Numerical simulations were conducted to assess the impact of these five factors. The results show that hydrogen production, commercial electricity consumption, and blockchain construction and maintenance costs are the two most influential factors. This indicates that adjusting these two factors can improve the speed at which the entire system reaches a stable state. In addition, increasing government subsidies appropriately can also increase the enthusiasm of players.

Preserving the Privacy of Electronic Health Records using Blockchain,2020,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,1.0,"Electronic health records (EHRs) are health information of patients that are saved digitally in a network. Various opportunities to enhance patient care, performance measures in clinical practice and contribute to clinical research in the future are provided by EHRs. The schemes used to store EHRs have been very insecure in the present era of smart cities and homes. The data can be easily breached by hackers and unauthorized external parties. Also, the data is not accessible to patients and care providers. These schemes are unable to create a balance between data security and data accessibility. But blockchain can resolve these issues. Blockchain creates a ledger system that is immutable and allows the transactions to take place in a decentralized manner. The three main features of blockchain technology - Security, Decentralization, and Transparency make any application built using it secure and not accessible by unauthorized parties. The manipulation of data is almost impossible to do in a blockchain network. In this project, we propose a system to implement EHRs using blockchain technology and make EHRs more secure and private.

BPS: A reliable and efficient pub/sub communication model with blockchain-enhanced paradigm in multi-tenant edge cloud,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8335594216100878,"In recent years, with the rapid development of smart city, prevalent pub/sub (publish/subscribe) streaming systems have been increasingly employed as upstream middleware layer in multi-tenant edge clouds, and feed large volume of data gathered from IoT devices of different tenants into downstream systems (e.g., data analytics and warehouse). A shared tenancy model where multiple untrusted applications or tenants utilize the same pub/sub system is generally exploited in edge cloud, which poses crucial challenges including privacy-sensitive data/metadata access threat and critical metadata modification by unauthorized tenants. A centralized monitoring node is invariably adopted in existing security strategies (such as ACL, TLS), which causes the pub/sub streaming model vulnerable to external malicious attacks and single point failure. In this paper, inspired by outstanding features of blockchain including tamper-resistance, decentralization, strong consistency, and traceability, we propose BPS, a general and decentralized Blockchain-enhanced Pub/Sub communication model for multi-tenant edge cloud, to redesign pub/sub system internal security mechanisms. Specifically, by exploiting blockchain technology, BPS can detect the illegal operations and behaviors from both malicious tenants and untrusted publishers or subscribers. BPS directly leverages Merkel Hash Tree (MHT) of blockchain to verify the integrity of critical and confidential metadata. Regarding authorization, BPS introduces smart-contract-enabled fine-grained control over partition topic-classified messages by storing access control list (ACL) into an append-only blockchain ledger. Additionally, an incentive mechanism is employed in BPS to reward honest publishers and subscribers. We implement BPS prototype based on Kafka and EoS blockchain.

How blockchain technology combats greenwashing: A game in a low-carbon preference market,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The development of the circular economy and the enhancement of market preference for low-carbon products have led to an increase in greenwashing practices. This study investigates the role of blockchain technology (BT) in combating greenwashing and examines its additional benefits by constructing a Stackelberg duopoly game model involving a low-carbon product manufacturer (LCPM) and a high-carbon product manufacturer (HCPM). Based on information asymmetry theory and signaling theory, the model integrates consumers’ low-carbon preference, consumer trust and product green level, enriching the research framework of this paper. Our findings indicate that BT prevents HCPM from engaging in greenwashing, and increases LCPM’s profit, consumer surplus and social welfare. However, it is important to note that the implementation of BT by LCPM does not improve the actual green level of products and may, in fact, lead to a decrease in product green level. Additionally, in markets with low green trust, HCPM may cease greenwashing and adopt BT, which is an unexpected outcome. The conclusions of this paper provide valuable insights for enterprises considering the adoption of BT to enhance product green level transparency and for the formulation of relevant government policies.",10.1016/j.cie.2025.111562,"Lv, Yang; Bi, Xinhua"
PoWaP: Proof of Work at Proximity for a crowdsensing system for collaborative traffic information gathering,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8917448009978693,"Blockchain technologies has become popular since the appearance of the first electric value exchange system on the Internet: Bitcoin. This technologies enable reliable data structure against tampering even in the absence of any authority to rely on, instead to check consistency with everyone who joins in the system. At present, however, the practical application of the blockchain technologies is to issue currency mainly traded for market speculation or money game. On the other hand, many researchers and software developers believe its applicability not only to improving today’s bank systems but also to creating a new solution to nonbank areas without relying on any centralized control system. In the field of transportation technologies for smart city, the combination of self-driving connected cars and IoT have been recently studied to achieve more efficient and safer transportation. To encourage a reduction of traffic jams by controlling mobility efficiently, it is necessary to automatically gather high-definition traffic information about traffic counts and road closures on urban roads. In this paper, a distributed crowdsensing system for collaborative gathering of traffic information is proposed. In the system, special beacon devices are asumed to be deployed along road segments by many unspecified individuals like today’s Wi-Fi routers. These devices at geographical proximity collaboratively and automatically record which vehicles passed in the road segment into the blockchain using Proof of Work (PoW). This process is incentivized by issuing its own digital currency. The system also enhances anti-tampering performance by cross-referencing blockchains of multiple road segments with each other. By chronologically saving traffic data into blocks in the blockchain, each beacon can refer traffic count and abnormal traffic, such as traffic jam and accidents. To evaluate the proposed system, we demonstrate some simple numerical simulations to show how the system makes localized PoW based consensus, and also the blockchain responds to quasi-real-time traffic status in the road segment.",10.1016/j.iot.2019.02.006,"Fujihara, Akihiro"
"Towards blockchain-enabled circular closed-loop supply chain and impact of consumers’ distrust in price, product greenness sensitivity and carbon tax and subsidy",2026,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9852367420704479,"With the increasing emphasis on environmental sustainability, both governments and consumers are more concerned than ever about the greenness of products. In this complex landscape, Supply Chains (SCs) face challenges in building trust and avoiding greenwashing accusations. Blockchain technology offers a promising solution by ensuring transparency and circularity within SCs, particularly in identifying customers for product recycling. This study pioneers the exploration of consumers' distrust in pricing and product greenness, alongside the impact of carbon policies (taxes and subsidies) within a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). Using classical Stackelberg game theory, we develop two models that identify equilibrium decisions for SC members, focusing on pricing, green production investment, circularity, and blockchain adoption. Additionally, we propose an evolutionary game theory model to find the optimal government policies and identify the long-term behaviour of the CLSC and government in two heterogeneous populations. Our findings reveal that if the retailer's share of blockchain costs falls below a certain threshold, blockchain adoption becomes less profitable than exclusive investment in green production. A higher (lower) subsidy rate benefits (harms) the retailer but disadvantages (benefits) the collector. Blockchain adoption is generally more profitable for manufacturers and retailers, though less so for collectors, and it also drives greater investment in green production. While subsidies encourage blockchain adoption, they are not a sustainable long-term strategy for governments. Ultimately, the evolutionarily stable strategy for SCs involves a balanced investment in both green production and blockchain or green production alone, depending on market characteristics and cost-sharing structures.",10.1016/j.ejor.2025.06.030,"Akbarzadeh Sarabi, Mohammad; Taleizadeh, Ata Allah; Bhattacharya, Arijit"

Blockchain in international e-government processes: Opportunities for recognition of foreign qualifications,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7713157795436385,"Purpose Recognition of foreign qualifications for authorising the exercise of a regulated profession gains importance in globalised economies and in international organisations such as the UNESCO. However, national procedures for such recognition have not yet experienced the transformative changes that occurred in other sectors of public administration. The study of “transborder digitisation” is still in its infancy. While governments consider the adoption of blockchain applications for the e-administration of trade-related procedures, for example customs procedures, it is timely to give some thoughts to recognition as well. Aims After explaining the role of recognition in international relations this article explores the features of recognition procedures that are relevant for the choice of a technology. It then aims to identify recognition authorities’ needs in terms of administrative tools and to find out the options and potential benefits of blockchain technology in view of those needs. It aims to find whether there are reasons to select that particular technology rather than conventional methods. This is highlighted in a concrete description of what could be a possible configuration of a blockchain solution for recognition procedures. Since opportunities are always balanced by limitations, the article also inquires into ithe expected challenges in adopting a blockchain system between different countries’ recognition authorities. The article’s overall aim is to offer an assessment of blockchain technologies’ potential in that field and to highlight developments in technology that could ease their adoption. Findings The article finds that the advantages brought by DLT technologies and the needed features of recognition processes coincide in several respects. However, some critical challenges and limitations for the application of blockchain in this field also exist. An adoption of that technology for that particular branch of public administration could occur provided that the technology continues to improve.

Blockchain technology provides reliable technical support for managing greenwashing behavior with features such as transparency and traceability. By constructing two state variables, i.e., supply chain information transparency and the goodwill level of green building materials, a tripartite mathematical model is developed using differential game method, which includes the government, a building material manufacturer, and a building material retailer. By solving the feedback Nash equilibrium solution, we investigate how the manufacturer's green innovation and greenwashing behaviors are impacted in the blockchain scenario. Additionally, the adoption strategy of blockchain technology is derived from a policy perspective. The results show that (1) blockchain adoption significantly curbs greenwashing but does not effectively incentivize green innovation; (2) blockchain deployment yields greater social welfare only under conditions of manufacturers' high degree of greenwashing, low consumers' green preference, minimal blockchain environmental cost, and high cost coefficient of green innovation; and (3) the goodwill of green building materials declines over time whether or not blockchain technology is adopted, whereas supply chain information transparency increases when blockchain is adopted.

To cope with these large sets of electronic device’s current requirements, better energy distribution is needed. Smart Grid (SG) facilitates energy providers to distribute electricity efficiently to the user according to their particular requirements. Recent advancements enable SG to monitor, analyze, control and coordinate for the demand and supply of electricity efficiency and energy saving. SG also allows two-way real-time communication between utilities and customers using cloud and Fog enabled infrastructures. SG minimizes management and operations cost, electricity theft, electricity losses, and maximize user comfort by giving the user choice about their energy use. It also facilitates Renewable Energy Resources (RER) and electric vehicles. Blockchain is a promising technology, provides the necessary features to solve most of these issues. Current Issues include saving a large amount of data, deletion, tampering, and revision of data. It also eliminates the necessity of intermediaries. Inherent security, along with the distributed nature, makes it a perfect candidate for improving the overall services. The rules of the smart contract are automatically enforced upon execution. Smart contracts are enhanced in a way that per-unit price is calculated dynamically based upon RER and utilities generated energy units in the overall grid.

Optimal smart contract for autonomous greenhouse environment based on IoT blockchain network in agriculture,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8872289784923204,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely adopted in many smart applications such as smart cities, healthcare, smart farms, industry etc. In recent few years, the greenhouse industry has earned significant consideration from the agriculture community due to its ability to produce fresh agricultural products with immense growth and production rate. However, labour and energy consumption costs increase the production cost of the greenhouse by 40–50% approximately. Moreover, the security and authenticity of agriculture data, particularly for yield monitoring and analysis, is also a challenging issue in current greenhouse systems.The greenhouse require optimal parameter settings with controlled environment to produce increase food production. Therefore, slight advancement can bring remarkable improvements concerning the increase in production with reduced overall cost. In this work, we contributed blockchain enabled optimization approach for greenhouse system. The proposed approach works in three steps to provide optimal greenhouse environment that are; prediction, optimization, and finally controlling. Initially, the Kalman filter algorithm is employed for predicting the greenhouse sensor data. In next step, the optimal parameters are computed for the indoor greenhouse environment. Finally, the optimized parameters are utilized by the control module to operate and regulate the actuator’s state to meet the desired settings in the indoor environment. To evaluate the performance of our proposed greenhouse system, we have developed an emulation tool. The proposed system has been investigated and compared against baseline approach concerning production rate and energy consumption. The obtained results reveal that the proposed optimization approach has improved the energy consumption by 19% against the prediction based approach and 41% against the Baseline scheme. Furthermore, the proof-of-concept based on the Hyperledger Fabric network is implemented on the top of the proposed greenhouse platform.

Interplay between manufacturers’ blockchain adoption strategy and retailers’ online channel introduction strategy in the presence of counterfeits,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"This study explores the interplay between the manufacturer’s blockchain adoption and the retailer’s online channel introduction strategy in the presence of counterfeits. Subsequently, the impact of blockchain adoption and channel selection decisions on consumer surplus is analyzed. We examine four distinct scenarios: with and without blockchain adoption, and in both single-channel and dual-channel settings. The results demonstrate that blockchain adoption significantly impacts the retailer’s channel distribution decisions. With blockchain, the retailer is always willing to add an online store. However, without blockchain, the retailer prefers to launch an online channel only when customer acceptance of the online store is high, or both customer acceptance of the online store and the number of purely online customers are low. Moreover, the retailer’s online channel introduction strategy can, in turn, affect the manufacturer’s blockchain adoption strategy. Specifically, the manufacturer will adopt blockchain only when consumers’ acceptance of the online channel is sufficiently high. Finally, utilizing blockchain can support strategies for expanding online sales channels. And retailers can leverage dual-channel models to enhance profitability and increase consumer surplus, while manufacturers can benefit from increased consumer confidence and expanded sales channels.

Large-scale platforms (LSPs), capitalizing on their valuation and awareness advantages, have been increasingly integrating competing small-scale platforms (SSPs) into their own interface, creating a compatible channel for consumers to access SSP services. However, the amplified data volume and inter-platform data exchange in this compatible mode increase the likelihood of data breaches, necessitating urgent and effective regulatory measures from the government to mitigate the associated data security risks In this study, we develop stylized game models to characterize the strategic interaction between an LSP and an SSP, and investigate the impact of government regulation on platforms’ blockchain-based defense efforts and pricing strategies. The main findings are as follows: (1) The compatibility decisions of the two platforms are contingent upon the proportion of SSP users purchasing their services through the compatible channel. (2) The efficacy of government regulation on data security does not necessarily maximize social welfare. The penalty schemes benefit social welfare only if consumers are highly sensitive to data security. (3) Government regulation incentivizes platforms to enhance their blockchain-based defense efforts, thereby mitigating the data breach risks associated with the compatible mode and amplifying the advantages of such a collaborative mode.

Towards sustainable smart cities: A secure and scalable trading system for residential homes using blockchain and artificial intelligence,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8855627000448508,"This paper proposes a secure blockchain based energy trading system for residential homes. In the system, a new proof-of-computational closeness (PoCC) consensus protocol is proposed for the selection of miners and the creation of blocks. Moreover, an analytical energy pricing policy is designed to solve the problem of existing energy pricing policies in a distributed trading environment. A dynamic multi-pseudonym mechanism is developed for the prosumers to preserve their transactional privacy during energy trading. Since it requires extra storage and computing resources for the blockchain miners to simultaneously execute both mining process and application intensive tasks, therefore, an improved sparse neural network (ISNN) is proposed for computation offloading to the cloud servers. In ISNN, a Jaya optimization algorithm is used to accelerate the error convergence rate while reducing the number of connections between different layers of neurons. Besides, ISNN optimizes the overall computational cost of the system. Furthermore, the security of the prosumers is ensured using blockchain technology while security analysis shows that the system is robust against the Sybil attack. The proposed blockchain based peer-to-peer secure energy trading system is extremely important for sustainable cities and society. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed pricing policy is compared with time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing policies. From the results, it is proved that the prosumers achieve a higher degree of satisfaction and utility when using the proposed pricing policy. Moreover, the probability of a successful Sybil attack is zero as the number of attackers’ identities and computational capacities increases. Under different sizes of data to be uploaded, the proposed ISNN scheme has the least average computational cost and data transmission time as compared to deep reinforcement learning combined with genetic algorithm (DRGO) and sparse evolutionary training and multi-layer perceptron (SET-MLP) schemes in the literature. Moreover, the proposed system is tested for scalability by increasing the number of prosumers.

Grounded in the Quintuple Helix Innovation (5HI) model, the study incorporates perspectives from government, industry, academia, civil society, and environmental actors to co-create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) tailored to Thailand’s organic agriculture sector. Data were gathered from in-depth interviews with key stakeholders including farmers, processors, logistics providers, retailers, certifiers, regulators, system developers, and consumers supported by document analysis of relevant agricultural, climate, and blockchain-related policies. The resulting MVP integrates mobile applications, IoT sensors, and blockchain verification for real-time carbon tracking and transparent certification. The originality of this study lies in operationalizing the 5HI framework into a practical, participatory MVP design that merges technical feasibility with environmental and institutional accountability. Findings show promise in reducing certification fraud and enhancing traceability legitimacy, although implementation challenges such as interoperability, startup costs, and rural access persist.

Design of a Trustless Smart City system: The #SmartME experiment,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7974234091604014,"A Smart City is an example of a domain where citizens and institutions, at any level, should be empowered to cooperate for the greater good of the respective communities, and one of the most powerful ways to attain that is by actually decentralizing any process that can escape single-authority control and the grip of centrally-managed bureaucracies, whilst at the same time not relying on any single party trusting any other. In line with this key insight, in this paper we have designed and implemented a decentralized, trustless DLT-based system for (environmental) sensing, data acquisition, storage, and consumption, in the context of a real-world Smart City deployment, #SmartME, and with the participation of independent, institutional, stakeholders. This Open Data system has been devised to be user-friendly, with an end-user wizard for trustless (i.e., independent) data audit. Indeed, the data collection layer does not trust any IoT node by default, but requires nodes to authenticate themselves when sending readings. Last but not least, the storage layer is again trustless, as institutions can pool together their resources, without trusting one another, nor entrusting the administration of the system to any third party.

Energy aware and secure routing for hierarchical cluster through trust evaluation,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.787406006374002,"With the rapid growth of technology advancement in wireless communication have resulted in interconnection of large number of devices covering wide range of application services. Wireless sensor network (WSN) have become popular and provide various benefits, including low-power smart computation, compact size, self organizing and ability to route via routing protocols. WSN covers a wide range of application services, including home automation, smart cities, fire detection, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and object tacking. Sensor nodes are tiny, battery operated, and suffer from fundamental restrictions such as available bandwidth, memory space, power restrictions, and limited resources. Due to their communication characteristics and working environment, WSN faces energy optimization and secure data communication challenges to increase network lifetime and defend against malicious nodes. To overcome energy scarcity and consumption issues, clustering methods have proven smart and effective approaches to reduce energy consumption and extend network life. Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), well-known clustering method, enhances energy efficiency by selecting cluster head (CH) on a rotation basis by employing random integer technique. To extend network stability period, extensions of LEACH was proposed. LEACH and its extensions mainly focus on optimal selection of CH and fail to concentrate on secure communication. Integration of blockchain and real-time message content validation (RMVC) in LEACH was modelled to detect malicious node through secure hash algorithm. However, existing scheme had complex cryptographic functions and higher computation overhead. In this paper, we present energy aware and secure routing (EASR) for hierarchical cluster based WSN. Existing LEACH is modified and an improved threshold value is adapted to select secure optimal CH and trust based routing model which combines direct and indirect trust opinion values to resist routing attacks for establishing trustworthy and reliable routes towards base station.",10.1016/j.measen.2024.101132,"Prasad B.S, Venkatesh; Roopashree, H.R."
PF-BTS: A Privacy-Aware Fog-enhanced Blockchain-assisted task scheduling,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7598766961525033,"In recent years, the deployment of Cloud Computing (CC) has become more popular both in research and industry applications, arising form various fields including e-health, manufacturing, logistics and social networking. This is due to the easiness of service deployment and data management, and the unlimited provision of virtual resources (VR). In simple scenarios, users/applications send computational or storage tasks to be executed in the cloud, by manually assigning those tasks to the available computational resources. In complex scenarios, such as a smart city applications, where there is a large number of tasks, VRs, or both, task scheduling is exposed as an NP-Hard problem. Consequently, it is preferred and more efficient in terms of time and effort, to use a task scheduling automation technique. As there are many automated scheduling solutions proposed, new possibilities arise with the advent of Fog Computing (FC) and Blockchain (BC) technologies. Accordingly, such automation techniques may help the quick, secure and efficient assignment of tasks to the available VRs. In this paper, we propose an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm in a Fog-enabled Blockchain-assisted scheduling model, namely PF-BTS. The protocol and algorithms of PF-BTS exploit BC miners for generating efficient assignment of tasks to be performed in the cloud’s VRs using ACO, and award miner nodes for their contribution in generating the best schedule. In our proposal, PF-BTS further allows the fog to process, manage, and perform the tasks to enhance latency measures. While this processing and managing is taking place, the fog is enforced to respect the privacy of system components, and assure that data, location, identity, and usage information are not exposed. We evaluate and compare PF-BTS performance, with a recently proposed Blockchain-based task scheduling protocol, in a simulated environment. Our evaluation and experiments show high privacy awareness of PF-BTS, along with noticeable enhancement in execution time and network load.",10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102393,"Baniata, Hamza; Anaqreh, Ahmad; Kertesz, Attila"
GRADE: Deep learning and garlic routing-based secure data sharing framework for IIoT beyond 5G,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.756618824532929,"The rise of automation with Machine-Type Communication (MTC) holds great potential in developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based applications such as smart cities, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supply chains, and smart industries without any human intervention. However, MTC has to cope with significant security challenges due to heterogeneous data, public network connectivity, and inadequate security mechanism. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we have proposed a blockchain and garlic-routing-based secure data exchange framework, i.e., GRADE, which alleviates the security constraints and maintains the stable connection in MTC. First, the Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Nadam optimizer efficiently predicts the class label, i.e., malicious and non-malicious, and forwards the non-malicious data requests of MTC to the Garlic Routing (GR) network. The GR network assigns a unique ElGamal encrypted session tag to each machine partaking in MTC. Then, an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is applied to encrypt the MTC data requests. Further, the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS)-based blockchain is employed to store the machine's session tags, which increases the scalability of the proposed GRADE framework. Additionally, the proposed framework has utilized the indispensable benefits of the 6G network to enhance the network performance of MTC. Lastly, the proposed GRADE framework is evaluated against different performance metrics such as scalability, packet loss, accuracy, and compromised rate of the MTC data request. The results show that the GRADE framework outperforms the baseline methods in terms of accuracy, i.e., 98.9%, compromised rate, i.e., 18.5%, scalability, i.e., 47.2%, and packet loss ratio, i.e., 24.3%.",10.1016/j.dcan.2022.11.004,"Jadav, Nilesh Kumar; Kakkar, Riya; Mankodiya, Harsh; Gupta, Rajesh; Tanwar, Sudeep; Agrawal, Smita; Sharma, Ravi"

Bubbles of Trust: A decentralized blockchain-based authentication system for IoT,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"There is no doubt that Internet of Things (IoT) occupy a very important role in our daily lives. Indeed, numerous objects that we use every time, are being equipped with electronic devices and protocol suites in order to make them interconnected and connected to the Internet. In IoT, things process and exchange data without human intervention. Therefore, because of this full autonomy, these entities need to recognize and authenticate each other as well as to ensure the integrity of their exchanged data. Otherwise, they will be the target of malicious users and malicious use. Due to the size and other features of IoT, it is almost impossible to create an efficient centralized authentication system. To remedy this limit, in this paper, we propose an original decentralized system called bubbles of trust, which ensures a robust identification and authentication of devices. Furthermore, it protects the data integrity and availability. To achieve such a goal, our approach relies on the security advantages provided by blockchains, and serves to create secure virtual zones (bubbles) where things can identify and trust each other.

Proof of witness presence: Blockchain consensus for augmented democracy in smart cities,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.845450309522955,"Smart Cities evolve into complex and pervasive urban environments with a citizens’ mandate to meet sustainable development goals. Repositioning democratic values of citizens’ choices in these complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens’ trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens’ choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means.

The CRBFT algorithm divides the nodes into three types, each with different responsibilities: master node, sub-nodes, and candidate nodes, and sets the credit attribute to the node. The node’s credit can be adjusted adaptively through the reinforcement learning algorithm, which can dynamically change the state of nodes. CRBFT algorithm can automatically identify malicious nodes and invalid nodes, making them exit from the consensus network. Experimental results show that the CRBFT algorithm can effectively improve the consensus network’s security.

Despite the extraordinary advancement, FL encounters three challenges that need to be resolved jointly, specifically, (1) how to properly measure the client reliability and contribution that serve as the basis for compensation allocation, (2) how to reasonably activate reliable clients, whose dataset grows gradually, to avoid over-learning, and (3) how to efficiently formulate the optimal local training decisions to improve model performance and energy efficiency of battery-constricted devices. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a Reputation based Triple-step Incentive mechanism of Federated learning (RTIFed), which (1) introduces reputation as the metric to measure client reliability and contribution while employing blockchain to accomplish decentralized and tamper-resistant reputation management, (2) activates clients with high reputation and informative data pursuant by a Richness-of-Information Activation Strategy (RIAS), (3) determines training epochs for each client based on a Stackelberg Game according to an Optimal Training Decision Strategy (OTDS). Numerical results clearly show that the proposed RTIFed effectively motivates high-quality clients and improves learning accuracy while reducing the energy cost to meet the low resource consumption need of battery-constricted devices in smart city FL scenarios.",10.1016/j.comnet.2024.110192,"Wen, Tian; Zhang, Hanqing; Zhang, Han; Wu, Huixin; Wang, Danxin; Liu, Xiuwen; Zhang, Weishan; Wang, Yuwei; Cao, Shaohua"

The IoT has shown wide adoption in various applications including smart cities, healthcare, trade, business, etc. Among these applications, fitness applications have been widely considered for smart fitness systems. The users of the fitness system are increasing at a high rate thus the gym providers are constantly extending the fitness facilities. Thus, scheduling such a huge number of requests for fitness exercise is a big challenge. Secondly, the user fitness data is critical thus securing the user fitness data from unauthorized access is also challenging. To overcome these issues, this work proposed a blockchain-based load-balanced task scheduling approach. A thorough analysis has been performed to investigate the applications of IoT in the fitness industry and various scheduling approaches. The proposed scheduling approach aims to schedule the requests of the fitness users in a load-balanced way that maximize the acceptance rate of the users’ requests and improve resource utilization. The performance of the proposed task scheduling approach is compared with the state-of-the-art approaches concerning the average resource utilization and task rejection ratio.

IoT connect billions of objects together for high speed data transfer especially in 5G-enabled industrial environment during information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture.

Understanding of blockchain-based identity management system adoption in the public sector,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8722701423462689,"Purpose This study aims to understand the benefits and challenges associated with the adoption of a blockchain-based identity management system in public services by conducting an academic literature review, and to explore the design of such a system that can be applied to the Korean government. Design/methodology/approach This study explores the adoption of a blockchain-based identity management system using a literature review and an actual design case intended for use by the government sector. Findings Blockchain-based identity management systems can significantly improve transparency, accountability, and reliability in the user control of one's own data while reducing the time and cost needed to deliver public services, as well as increasing administrative efficiency. However, it is not always easy to implement such systems, and introducing new technologies in the government field requires a complicated, time-consuming process. There is currently an appetite for research extending beyond the typical technology-driven approach to elucidate the government adoption of new technologies and explore its implications. Practical implications The idea behind this system is that by storing and managing personal information on the blockchain and providing mobile apps to customers, users can log in or retrieve previously authenticated personal information without having to go through an authentication process. Since users do not need to go through the verification process every time, it is expected that they will be able to access only the necessary personal information more quickly and conveniently without having to deal with unnecessary details. In addition, the blockchain-based operation of a public service effectively increases the transparency and reliability of that service and reduces the social costs caused by personal information leakage. Originality/value This study introduces the design of a blockchain-based identity management system that can be used in public services, specifically in the Korean government sector for the first time.

Achieving efficient and Privacy-preserving energy trading based on blockchain and ABE in smart grid,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"With the advent of the Industry 4.0 era, the development of smart cities based on the Internet of Things (IoT) has reached a new level. As a key component of the Internet of Things (IoT), the security of wireless sensor networks (WSN) has received widespread attention. Among them, Energy Internet, as an important part to support the construction of smart cities, its security and reliability research is becoming more and more important. In the Energy Internet, distributed energy transaction model is a promising approach to replace the traditional centralized transaction model and has become the leading direction of development in energy trading. As the underlying support, blockchain technology is attracting more and more attention due to its advantages, i.e., integrity and non-repudiation. However, most blockchain-based trading models face the problem of privacy disclosure. In this paper, to solve this problem, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is introduced as the core algorithm to reconstruct the transaction model. Specifically, we build a general model for distributed transactions called PP-BCETS (Privacy-preserving Blockchain Energy Trading Scheme). It can achieve fine-grained access control through transaction arbitration in the ciphertext form. This design can maximize the protection of privacy information, and considerably improve the security and reliability of the transaction model. Additionally, a credibility-based equity proof consensus mechanism is proposed in PP-BCETS, which can greatly increase the operation efficiency. The security analysis and experimental evaluations are conducted to prove the validity and practicability of our proposed scheme.",10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.08.012,"Guan, Zhitao; Lu, Xin; Yang, Wenti; Wu, Longfei; Wang, Naiyu; Zhang, Zijian"

The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications.

Blockchain-driven incentive mechanism for agricultural water-saving: A tripartite game model,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8498633436629532,"Implementing water-saving agriculture is an important measure to alleviate water resource shortage, improve agricultural ecological environment, and achieve sustainable agricultural development. However, both water-saving service companies (WSSCs) and farmers often lack the motivation to adopt water-saving practices due to the high implementation costs involved. To overcome this shortcoming, this study aims to design a blockchain-driven incentive mechanism based on the evolutionary game theory, in which the government, WSSCs and farmers are game subjects and the idea of cooperative incentive for the government is introduced. Through analyzing the complex interactions among various stakeholders and agricultural water-saving incentives, some findings of this study are obtained. Firstly, the usage of blockchain technology (BT) in the incentive mechanism for agricultural water-saving is reflected in supervision and additional default costs, which promote the sustainable cooperation among government, WSSCs and farmers in varying degrees. Secondly, the additional default costs brought by the usage of BT have a deterrent effect on WSSCs and farmers, which makes them to actively implement water-saving practices. Thirdly, the additional default cost brought by BT has become the main basis for the government to choose BT supervision. As the additional default cost increases, the government are not more inclined to use BT. It provides valuable insights into motivating diverse stakeholders to actively participate in water-saving practices, promoting sustainable water resources management in agriculture.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140197,"Cao, Yongchao; Li, Huimin; Su, Limin"
Food manufacturer willingness to employ blockchain technology system under the social Co-governance framework: China's situation,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8753525251426445,"The blockchain technology system has gradually come to be employed in the food supply chain system, and it has emerged that the system offers the unique function of effectively curbing counterfeiting by food manufacturers. Unlike previous research on adoption by enterprises of new technology, this paper probes into the specific evolutionary routes of game subjects from the perspective of the precondition for enterprises' willingness to employ blockchain technology on the basis of China's social co-governance framework and by establishing a tripartite evolutionary game model of food manufacturer, government and consumer. The study then tests and verifies the stability conditions of equilibrium points and the relationship between these equilibrium points and the social co-governance level through numerical simulation analysis. On the above basis, the expected market proceeds of food producers employing blockchain technology and the influence of government and consumer behavior on enterprises' selection of a behavior strategy and the level of social co-governance are analyzed. The results show that every subject selects their own behavior strategy on the basis of the balance of their respective interests, and the final stability condition of the system is independent of their initial intentions. Rather, the expected sales volume of foods employing blockchain technology, governmental behavior (e.g., supervision, casual inspection, economic punishment, and fiscal subsidies), and complaints made by consumers constitute the main factors that influence food enterprises' selection of a behavior strategy. The level of social co-governance and the behavior of both government and consumers will ultimately be accomplished by influencing enterprises' expected economic returns, and the selection of an enterprise behavior strategy internally depends on the expected economic returns from producing foods employing blockchain technology. Therefore, this paper makes relevant proposals in an attempt to assist the Chinese government to better promote and popularize the blockchain technology system among food manufacturing enterprises.",10.1016/j.crfs.2023.100619,"Wu, Linhai; Chen, Jiahui; Dai, Xiaoting; Chen, Xiujuan; Zhang, Jingxiang"

Blockchain-driven framework for construction waste recycling and reuse,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8876026894914333,"Conventional management mechanisms for construction waste recycling and reuse (CWRR) often cause considerable information asymmetry, inadequate government supervision, and imperfect incentive mechanisms, resulting in frequent illegal dumping and landfilling of construction waste and relatively low recycling rates. To address these issues, we introduce blockchain technology to CWRR. The design science research methodology was adopted to identify the main steps in functional requirement identification and blockchain framework development for CWRR. To explain how blockchain can improve the CWRR process, a conceptual model for the functional requirements of the proposed framework was constructed using qualitative analysis. A blockchain-driven framework was developed to overcome practical barriers in the CWRR industry. Based on scenario simulation results, the proposed framework had execution and transaction costs of $4.735 and $1.276, respectively, and latency performance at the millisecond level. The results indicate that (1) based on specific problems systematically identified from CWRR practices, the proposed framework can address practical barriers in the CWRR industry more directly; (2) the CWRR industry can use blockchain technology to achieve information sharing, comprehensive government supervision, and effective incentive mechanisms and (3) the blockchain-driven framework has high efficacy and can promote efficient CWRR and high-quality development of CWRR industry chain.

Competing manufacturers blockchain technology adoption strategies for carbon emission misrepresentation under cap-and-trade regulation,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Under cap-and-trade regulation, manufacturers may misrepresent their carbon emissions to gain more profits. Blockchain technology can enhance the transparency and credibility of information, making it a suitable solution for addressing such misrepresentation. To investigate the impacts of misrepresentation of carbon emissions and blockchain technology on the production process among competing manufacturers, we develop three supply chain models based on various blockchain adoption strategies and analyze the equilibrium decisions for each member, as well as the cost threshold for adopting blockchain technology. The results indicate that both manufacturers tend to moderately overstate carbon emissions to enhance profitability, but it ultimately impedes the long-term sustainable development of the supply chain. Furthermore, adopting blockchain technology can significantly enhance the profitability, consumer surplus, and social welfare of the supply chain. As more manufacturers adopt blockchain technology, these benefits are further amplified. However, the adoption of blockchain does not consistently lead to favorable outcomes. An increase in product demand will inevitably lead to a rise in total carbon emissions. Meanwhile, blockchain technology will only be adopted by manufacturers if its operational costs fall within a specific range, which is approximately 12% of their profit levels. Manufactures should collaborate with reputable and highly skilled blockchain companies, while governments should also provide appropriate subsidies to support manufacturers. Moreover, implementing cap-and-trade regulation and increasing the trading price of unit carbon emission permit can serve as incentives for manufacturers to invest in green technology aimed at reducing total carbon emissions.",10.1016/j.cie.2025.110960,"Ran, Wenxue; Duan, Yiting"

Considering influencing factors such as the cost of blockchain technology, and the perceived and real quality of fresh produce, should blockchain technology be adopted in the supply chains for fresh produce? In this paper, for a fresh produce supply chain consisting of an e-commerce platform, i.e., Business-to-Consumer (B2C) or Online-to-Offline (O2O), and an offline retailer, we apply the Stackelberg game model to investigate the equilibrium strategy of the supply chain under the following scenarios: Model C(O) where the B2C (O2O) supply chain without blockchain technology; and Model CB(OB) where the B2C (O2O) supply chain implements blockchain technology. We research the conditions for implementing blockchain technology in the B2C (O2O) supply chain, the best business model for the e-commerce platform, and the conditions for the offline retailer to cooperate with the O2O e-commerce platform. Further, we investigate the impact of consumers’ awareness of traceability and the incentive effect of government subsidy on the implementation of blockchain technology. It is shown that the B2C (O2O) supply chain implements blockchain technology only when consumers' awareness of traceability is high. At this time, the offline retailer has the willingness to cooperate with the e-commerce platform. For the B2C supply chain, government subsidies are beneficial to the B2C e-commerce platforms but not to the offline retailer.

Evaluation of a Blockchain-Based Prescription System and Data Source for National Research and Development,2024,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,1.0,"In the Philippines, healthcare providers, government agencies, and research institutions use data from patient prescriptions to generate reports for health planning and decision-making. However, current e-prescription systems have vulnerabilities, including erroneous information, hacking attempts, a single point of failure, and medical fraud. In addition to affecting the quality of data reporting, these issues violate a patient’s rights to data privacy. One promising solution is a blockchain-based prescription system. Blockchain’s immutable ledger accurately traces medical fraud and erroneous information, while its decentralized nature reduces the impact of failures. Performance is an important consideration, as healthcare systems need to be scalable and time-sensitive. This study aims to understand the performance and security of blockchain-based prescription systems. It focuses on evaluating system performance and scalability when using different encryption algorithms.

An innovative method for short-term forecasting of blockchain cryptocurrency price,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9077755443191411,"Cryptocurrency market sentiment is relatively unstable, which makes cryptocurrency price an attribute of high volatility. Accurate forecasting methods help to clarify the volatility trend of the cryptocurrency price, thereby reducing the investment risk of participants in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, this research proposed a new method for short-term forecasting of the cryptocurrency price based on a small sample. This study took three typical blockchain cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin) as experimental objects, chose data intervals with different volatility trends in the U.S. stock indices between 2022 and 2023 as sample data, and used grey correlation analysis to select core affecting variables. Furthermore, this study built a grey multivariate convolution model with prioritized accumulating novel information for conducting prediction experiments on blockchain cryptocurrency price. The research findings demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high prediction accuracy in all experiments, and the model accuracy is superior to the comparison models. This study proposes a scientific prediction approach for blockchain cryptocurrency price, which can guide financial investors in developing and analyzing quantitative financial trading strategies to a certain extent. Meanwhile, this study provides a specific reference for relevant government departments to strengthen cryptocurrency regulation, prevent financial risks, and maintain financial stability.",10.1016/j.apm.2024.115795,"Yang, Yunfei; Wang, Xiaomei; Xiong, Jiamei; Wu, Lifeng; Zhang, Yifang"
Adopting blockchain technology to block less sustainable products’ entry in global trade,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"In this study, we examine how the use of blockchain technology deters less sustainable products’ entry (LSPE) in the cross-border supply chains in which the entrant produces less sustainable products and enters into the incumbent’s market. We identify that when the blockchain adoption cost exceeds a threshold, the entry can be blocked by mandatory blockchain adoption and the incumbent enjoys the monopoly position; when the blockchain adoption cost falls into an intermediate range, deterrence needs not only the use of blockchain technology but also price distortion by the incumbent; when the blockchain adoption cost is sufficiently low, the incumbent must compete with the entrant because blockchain technology is no longer effective for deterrence. Moreover, we examine how government intervention (tariff or subsidy) affects LSPE and find that both tariff and subsidy schemes can enhance the value of adopting blockchain technology to prevent LSPE. If the blockchain adoption cost is moderate, then levying tariffs on LSPE can achieve an economic and environment-dominating outcome, but the subsidy scheme cannot. Our findings provide managerial insights for cross-border supply chain managers and offer guidance to policy makers who design trade policies.",10.1016/j.tre.2022.102695,"Cao, Yifan; Shen, Bin"
Investing in a zero-carbon future: game-theoretic strategies for clean energy and blockchain in commercial buildings,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7811678086747054,"Achieving zero-carbon building status through the integration of on-site clean energy is a critical decarbonization strategy, yet it introduces significant challenges at the intersection of technology, economics, and stakeholder alignment. The process is often hindered by high upfront costs, grid-integration risks, and information asymmetries that create a complex coordination problem between building owners and energy utilities. To dissect these strategic challenges, this study develops a differential game model analyzing the investment and operational decisions for both clean energy and blockchain adoption. Our analysis reveals that despite these hurdles, a clean energy collaboration is a Pareto-improving strategy, increasing steady-state profits for the owner by 15% and the utility by 88% over the baseline. We then quantify the severe impact of coordination frictions, showing that high grid inefficiency can cause utility profits to plummet from 0.167 to a loss of −0.0013. This provides a strong rationale for adopting blockchain, which acts as a powerful catalyst by mitigating these issues, further elevating profits by an additional 54.4% for the owner and 72.6% for the utility. The model also demonstrates that achieving zero-carbon status resolves a key market risk, transforming price volatility from a liability into a revenue opportunity. From a policy perspective, direct construction subsidies prove most effective, boosting owner and utility profits by a further 9.3% and 33.7% respectively, while technology subsidies are crucial for overcoming initial adoption barriers. Grounded in a real-world case study, this research provides a robust quantitative framework to guide the strategic decisions necessary to make zero-carbon buildings both profitable and scalable.",10.1016/j.enbuild.2025.116323,"Leng, Jie; Cheng, Yue"

How to promote the application of blockchain in prefabricated building supply chain? Analysis based on evolutionary game,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Prefabricated buildings have become an effective way to sustainable development. At the same time, the process from component production to assembly also puts forward higher requirements for data between the subjects of each project. As a powerful database storage system, blockchain technology (BCT) can meet the needs of it, but the BCT has not been widely used. In addition, the Chinese government has issued a series of policy documents in recent years to promote smart digital technologies such as BCT, which have not been well implemented. Therefore, this paper analyzes the decision-making behavior mechanism of stakeholders and the factors that affect the implementation of BCT by establishing an asymmetric evolutionary game model. The model results reveal how to effectively promote the application of BCT in the supply chain of prefabricated buildings and help the government to stimulate the enthusiasm of other stakeholders to use BCT.",10.1139/cjce-2022-0245,"Liu, Yishu; Li, Xiaojuan"
Data-driven approach for measuring and curbing Green House Gases (GHG) emissions in the supply chain of India,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8480196553663282,"Global warming has caused significant negative consequences for developing countries like India. The carbon market was considered as an effective solution for curbing Green House Gases (GHG) emissions, which is considered as the primary reason for global warming. Carbon market was established in the Kyoto protocol among developed economies and later extended to developing economies through the Paris Agreement. The international carbon market did not return satisfactory results. However, the Chinese domestic carbon market returned good results motivating the Indian government to create a strategy, policy, and plan for the Indian domestic carbon market. Through a strategic conceptual framework, this research has tried to establish a hypothetical theory that success of carbon market in the supply chain of India would require data-driven approach to measuring and curbing GHG emissions caused by the polluting entities. Data-driven approach helps in policy making and actions based on actual measurements instead of speculations. The strategic conceptual framework shows interfacing between the domains of Indian carbon credits policy and the data-driven approach through two government-sponsored and controlled systems: a market exchange and a blockchain. Other components proposed are an accounting system of carbon credits on big data systems and entity-specific cloud-hosted data systems supported by Artificial Intelligence. This research proposed that carbon credits should not be traded as an alternative to implementing technologies and innovations for GHG emissions, and should not have expiry dates. The model may perform better than the European model as it is based on the top-down approach (based on China), adopts Industry 4.0 technologies, active measurements and accounting, smart contracts, and data-driven enforcements. The practical implications of the model may be higher involvement of manufacturing entities in curbing GHG emissions with government-controlled governance of their carbon credits trading and holding, their technical innovation capabilities, and their compliances.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.145392,"Pandey, Amitesh; Choubey, Vikas"

Design/methodology/approach A literature review provides insight into trust development in supply chains. Research uses a case study of two wine supply chains: the producers, importers, logistics companies and UK Government agencies. Semi-structured interviews determine how trust and trustworthiness develop in buyer-supplier relationships and the impact of a blockchain-based technology proof of concept on supply chain trust. Findings A blockchain-based platform introduces common trusted data, reducing data duplication and improving supply chain visibility. The platform supports trust building between parties but does not replace the requirements for organisations to establish a position of trust. Contrary to literature claims for blockchain trustless disintermediation, new intermediaries are introduced who need to be trusted. Research limitations/implications The case study presents challenges specific to UK customs borders, and research needs to be repeated in different contexts to establish if findings are generalisable. Practical implications A blockchain-based platform can improve supply chain efficiency and trust development but does not remove the need for trust and trust-building processes. Blockchain platform providers need to build a position of trust with all participants. Originality/value Case study research shows how blockchain facilitates but does not remove trust, trustworthiness and trust relationships in established supply chains.

Leveraging blockchain for robust and transparent E-voting systems,2025,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,0.6993450609539128,"Voting is considered one of the most critical actions for proper decision-making in governmental entities, boards of directors, and the financial sector. Many researchers proposed E-voting systems where the voting process is done online or through secure voting stations with high levels of trust for recording and counting the votes. Moreover, with the recent pandemic highlighting the need for remote voting, transitioning to E-voting is becoming even more critical. One way to build such technology is through Blockchain, which can be employed to guarantee the voting system requirements such as reliability, anonymity, decentralization, and privacy. This work proposes a blockchain-based E-voting system that consists of a distributed architecture for the voter, intermediate servers, and blockchain network components. The intermediate servers are mainly used to balance the workload between the voters and the blockchain servers. The system servers apply a scheduling algorithm to distribute the workload amongst themselves. In addition to the distributed architecture, a new algorithm for storing the blocks within each server’s database is introduced. Emphasis is further placed on how these blocks are broadcast to the other servers. Simulation results show a clear difference in execution time when comparing the proposed distributed architecture with the centralized system. In addition, the new proposed blockchain algorithm shows better results in executing the vote-counting task and identifying any corrupted blocks.",10.1016/j.csa.2025.100086,"Abo-Akleek, Fatima; Mowafi, Moad; Taqieddin, Eyad S.; Shatnawi, Ahmed S."

Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach employing a web-based questionnaire was applied, and the empirical data were gathered from 329 potential and current users of Blockchain in the accounting and auditing profession in Jordan. The analytical model was based on structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS 25.0. Findings The experimental findings of the structural path confirmed that performance expectancy (PE), social influence (SI), Blockchain transparency (BT) and Blockchain efficiency (BE) were significantly affecting individuals’ behavioral intention (BI) toward the use of Blockchain-based systems and helped to explain (0.67) of its variance. Also, BE has a positive significant impact on PE. Whereas, in contrast to what is anticipated, the influence of effort expectancy (EE) on BI was not supported. Additionally, users’ intentions were found to affect the actual usage (AU) behavior and helped to explain (0.69) of its variance.

Investment and subsidy strategy for low-carbon port operation with blockchain adoption,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"As governments attach importance to carbon neutrality, achieving carbon emission reductions in port operations through the use of subsidies and emerging technology has become a research hotspot. In this paper, we establish a three-stage Stackelberg game model to discuss stakeholders' strategies in a shipping supply chain consisting of the government, the port authority, and the shipping company. Low-carbon transportation preferences and the low-carbon trust of cargo owners in the port authority are included in our model. Four policy scenarios are created depending on whether the government adopts blockchain technology and two subsidy schemes, namely, a low-carbon technology subsidy scheme and a low-carbon quantity subsidy scheme, for ports. We find that i) the applicability of the two subsidy schemes varies with the low-carbon transportation preferences of cargo owners. ii) The low-carbon quantity scheme provides greater benefits to stakeholders compared to the low-carbon technology subsidy scheme. iii) A decrease in unit investment cost for port equipment upgrades leads to an increase in the total amount of subsidy. iv) The introduction of blockchain technology results in an increase in transportation demand, social welfare, and all stakeholders' profits. These findings enrich the theory of low-carbon port construction in the context of blockchain technology applications. They may also provide managerial insights into the government's low-carbon governance strategy and inform port authorities' low-carbon investment and pricing decisions.",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106966,"Li, Zhaokun; Wang, Luteng; Wang, Guili; Xin, Xu; Chen, Kang; Zhang, Tao"

Using a difference-in-differences approach with a sample of listed firms in China from 2016 to 2022, we find that the accrual quality and earnings informativeness improve post-adoption. This treatment effect is more pronounced for firms with more complex operations and those located in technologically advanced and market-oriented environments, but is similar across firms with varying earnings management incentives. Blockchain adoption is associated with fewer error-related accounting restatements, but not with non-error-related restatements or corporate tax avoidance.

In addition, some high-value target domains, such as banks and government agencies may have been frequently attacked, and the adversaries can launch the targeted attacks by making use of the disclosure of the issuing CAs. To address these pressing issues or challenges, in this work, we propose a novel blockchain-based PKI framework using linkable ring signatures, called LRS_PKI. Specially, we propose a novel certificate issuance mechanism that utilizes linkable ring signatures to hide the issuing CA, so as to reduce the risk of the PKI system being attacked. Additionally, we introduce the blockchain as a public log to record the certificate operations, and adopt the decentralized storage IPFS to store the certificates to decouple the blockchain layer and storage layer. In order to prevent the CA from issuing unauthorized certificates, we have added a condition to verify whether the issuing CA is consistent with the previous issuing CA in the certificate verification. The security analysis and experimental results show that LRS_PKI is both secure and efficient.",10.1016/j.comnet.2023.110043,"Liang, Weibiao; You, Lin; Hu, Gengran"
Impact of government fund policy and blockchain technology on closed-loop supply chains in textile and apparel industry,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9443658826604424,"Textile waste presents significant environmental risks for the textile and apparel (T&A) industry; however, most textiles can be recycled, enabling the remanufacturing of energy and fiber for resale in the secondary market. In this regard, the importance of a Government Fund Policy (GFP) has been emphasized to promote recycling and remanufacturing efforts aimed at establishing T&A closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs). Simultaneously, blockchain technology and green-product design have transformed T&A brand marketing dynamics due to their crucial roles in enhancing brand trust and increasing market demand. Nevertheless, there is limited research dedicated to examine the interactive effects of GFP and blockchain technology within T&A supply chains. This paper proposes a stylized CLSC game involving a T&A manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer sells new and remanufactured T&A products to the retailer while determining green-product design efforts (i.e., green degree). The retailer determines selling prices but incurs usage costs associated with adopting blockchain technology. Through equilibrium analyses, we find that the simultaneous implementation of GFP and blockchain technology can incentivize T&A manufacturers to enhance the green degree of their products, thereby improving brand trust and market demand. All supply chain agents can benefit from adopting blockchain technology as long as its usage cost is below a threshold level, regardless of whether GFP is implemented or not. Similarly, irrespective of whether blockchain technology is adopted or not, if the ratio between remanufacturing subsidies and environmental taxes exceeds a specific threshold value, GFP will serve as an incentive for sustainability efforts among T&A firms while providing them with greater advantages. Additionally, the simultaneous implementation of GFP and blockchain technology holds significant potential for mitigating environmental pollution, i.e., by carefully selecting appropriate degrees of GFP and blockchain technology parameters, a mutually beneficial outcome can be achieved for T&A firms, consumers, and the environment. These findings have important implications for T&A supply chain managers seeking to optimize CLSCs while integrating blockchain technology.

Within the DID chain, we deploy two contracts: the IdentityManager Contract and the PersonalIdentity Contract. Users are empowered to register their decentralized identity, while governments can leverage the IdentityManager Contract to generate decentralized identities. Once users obtain their identity, they can proceed to register the app-chain using that identity. Moreover, users can utilize the AccessControlManager chaincode within the App-chain to share de-identified information generated by their wearable devices, retaining full control over managing the access control rights of their de-identified information.

Dual-channel slot sales strategy for container liner shipping companies with blockchain technology adoption,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The container liner shipping industry plays a crucial role in intercontinental trade. In contrast to other modes of transportation, container shipping is subject to seasonal fluctuations in shipping demand. This phenomenon leads shipping companies to oversell slots in the contract market during the high-demand season. Fortunately, the rise of blockchain technology in the container shipping industry offers a potential solution in the form of a blockchain sales channel (BC). In addition, this BC can also enhance logistics transparency in comparison to the traditional sales channel (TC), which in turn increases the trust level of shippers. Under this background, we develop a two-stage Stackelberg game model to address the optimal sales channel selection problem, which involves a shipping company and multiple shippers. This model comprehensively considers the shipping demand seasonal fluctuations, the overselling behavior of the shipping company (under TC) and the higher trust level of shippers (under BC). We analyze the pricing strategies of the shipping company and the slot ordering strategies of shippers and investigate the optimal sales channel for stakeholders. Additionally, we discuss the impact of government subsidies on social welfare under the BC. The results show that i) the growth of logistics transparency may benefit shippers but sometimes damage the interests of the shipping company. The greater the degree of overselling compensation, the more unfavorable it is to shippers’ interests. ii) The emergence of an optimal sales channel for stakeholders depends on the extent of shipping demand seasonal fluctuations, the relationship between the number of slots allocated to the contract and spot markets under BC and TC, and overselling compensation. iii) Government subsidies for blockchain technology can facilitate dual growth in social welfare and supply chain profits. These findings have implications for shipping companies and shippers in selecting sales channels and in providing policy recommendations to governments.",10.1016/j.tranpol.2024.12.006,"Liu, Miaohui; Xin, Xu; Wang, Xiaoli; Zhang, Tao; Chen, Kang"
Exploring the adoption of blockchain in modular integrated construction projects: A game theory-based analysis,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Efficient information sharing across Modular integrated Construction (MiC) stakeholders (e.g., client, contractor, manufacturer, etc.) is critical for MiC project success. Blockchain, a creative information and communication technology, provides MiC participants with powerful solutions to address the “island of information” and foster mutual trust among inter-organizational collaborations. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence from the construction industry about blockchain deployment, showing that the industry is cautious about, and generally unprepared for, implementing this disruptive technology. Existing studies mainly focused on proposing technological solutions for blockchain-based applications, with little attempt made to demonstrate how MiC stakeholders make decisions about blockchain adoption. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study adopted game theory to examine stakeholders' decision-making processes. The results revealed the best responses of key MiC stakeholders regarding whether or not to implement blockchain under various conditions. Their decisions were largely influenced by diffusion rate value thresholds, which were mainly affected by three factors: the benefits of blockchain adoption; government subsidies; and relevant costs. In addition, two valuable implications (i.e., enhancing stakeholders’ perceived values on blockchain adoption through pilot projects and publishing subsidy or incentive policies) were determined for promoting the adoption of blockchain in MiC projects.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137115,"Zhang, Pan; Wu, Haitao; Li, Heng; Zhong, Botao; Fung, Ivan W.H.; Lee, Yiu Yin Raymond"
Blockchain adoption for combating remanufacturing perceived risks in a reverse supply chain,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Remanufacturing provides excellent opportunities for socially responsible firms to achieve sustainable operations, benefiting manufacturers, consumers, and the environment. However, the market for remanufactured products faces challenges due to perceived risks, with consumers often expressing concerns about the quality and provenance of remanufactured parts. The advent of blockchain technology offers a promising solution for reverse supply chain players to manage these perceived risks. This study develops a game-theoretical model to investigate the incentives of reverse supply chain players to adopt blockchain technology to mitigate remanufacturing perceived risk. We examine consumer preferences for new and remanufactured products under different blockchain adoption strategies. Our findings indicate that choosing an appropriate blockchain adoption strategy can increase the remanufacturing rate. However, blockchain adoption does not necessarily expand market share. The optimal blockchain adoption strategy is determined by quality distrust and unit blockchain cost. When quality distrust is low and the unit blockchain cost is intermediate, investing in blockchain technology for new products can result in a triple-win outcome for the OEM, the recycler, and the environment. If quality distrust is high and the unit blockchain cost is not excessive, investing in blockchain technology for remanufactured products can also lead to a triple-win outcome. However, when both factors are low, no blockchain adoption strategy benefits the recycler or the environment, and there is a risk of the OEM overinvesting. We further investigate the effects of heterogeneous blockchain adoption costs, government regulations, and endogenized pricing by a third party on triple-win regions. This study offers valuable insights for reverse supply chain players on how to leverage emerging technologies to address remanufacturing perceived risk.",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103448,"Wang, Manman; Yang, Feng; Shan, Feifei; Guo, Yu"
"Organic production competitiveness: A bi-level model integrating government policy, sustainability objectives, and blockchain transparency",2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9767487234744292,"The government subsidizes organic production to reduce the cost of production and encourage consumers to buy it. However, some organic producers do not adhere to organic production standards, which erodes customer confidence in these products. Companies use blockchain technology to display the entire production process to customers and increase transparency. This paper presents a bi-level model designed to investigate the competition between conventional and organic producers. The government wields more power than the producers and makes decisions at the upper level of the model. The demand function for each conventional or organic product is contingent upon the decisions made by its producer, as well as those made by competing producers, leading to competition at the lower level of the model. The model examines the effects of the government's role, the growth of export sales abroad, the type of information technology used in decision-making, and sustainable goals. The public and private versions of blockchain technology for organic production are compared in terms of transparency, costs, and environmental concerns. The proposed model is converted into a single-level model using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) approach. The results show that a combination of economic, social, and environmental goals can achieve a sustainable equilibrium. The comparison of blockchain technology scenarios shows that the utilization of private blockchains enhances producer profitability and reduces GHG emissions, albeit accompanied by an increase in additive usage. The sensitivity analysis of the public blockchain indicates that while consumers find an increased cost of use acceptable, it diminishes the economic appeal relative to private blockchain.",10.1016/j.cie.2024.110147,"Manteghi, Yashar; Arkat, Jamal; Mahmoodi, Anwar"

Does blockchain technology need to be introduced in the closed-loop supply chain based on product lifecycle management?,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.938243796770952,"Resource wastage, prevalent in all industries, hinders sustainable economic and social development. Inspired by the application of blockchain technology in product traceability, we find that government investment in blockchain technology platforms (BTP) can facilitate the recycling of waste products. We develop a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) model consisting of a single manufacturer and a single retailer, examining the impact of BTP on the CLSC and its potential benefits to the government. The results show that BTP increases retail prices and market demand within the CLSC but has a non-monotonic impact on wholesale prices. Interestingly, we find that even when the BTP unit cost is moderate, BTP can still enhance CLSC profits if the recycling rate falls below a certain threshold. Furthermore, in scenarios with a high service elasticity coefficient, CLSC can leverage BTP to boost profits, even when the unit usage cost is substantial. Under specific conditions, timely investments in BTP can augment social welfare for the government. Notably, government investment in BTP becomes imperative when the recycling rate is relatively low, and the environmental burden is significant. Finally, this paper explores the conditions conducive to collaborative implementation of BTP by the government and CLSC, providing a valuable reference for their effective BTP implementation.",10.1016/j.cie.2024.109881,"Wang, Yuyan; Gao, Junhong; Cheng, T.C.E.; Gong, Yu; Wu, Tsung-Hsien"
A qualitative analysis of rural fishermen: Potential for blockchain-enabled framework for livelihood sustainability,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7388803178790788,"Rural fishing communities face numerous challenges related to livelihood security, as they are engaged in a risky and labour-intensive occupation. They often receive only a small portion of the profits, due to the influence of self-serving local intermediaries, lack of transparency in the business processes, trust issues, and power differentials among stakeholders. Although still in its infancy, blockchain technology has been adopted in various urban settings to mitigate similar challenges and to build trust through its security attributes, data ledger transparency, and smart contract automation. Yet, few have explored the efficacy of blockchain technology in addressing the unique challenges faced by rural fishermen in marketing their catch and connecting them to a broader range of customers for improved livelihood resilience. This study aims to examine how the livelihood resilience of fishermen can be increased through the potential of a blockchain, in a fishing community in the coastal village of Alappad in Kerala, India.

The integration of blockchain technology provides a reliable framework for tracing the origin of these products. However, the complex interplay of above factors poses significant obstacles to ensuring the sustainable operation of marine environmental governance systems, particularly in relation to the reverse recycling and remanufacturing processes. Therefore, this study investigates a coupled system that combines marine plastic waste treatment with remanufacturing methodologies. A differential game model was employed to analyze four distinct scenarios, each representing a unique strategic combination of blockchain implementation and enterprise involvement in marine plastic waste remanufacturing. This study examined the scale of marine plastic waste, stakeholder behavior, and optimal profit across these scenarios. These findings indicate that the application of blockchain technology encourages governments to enhance their recycling initiatives. Moreover, the transparency afforded by blockchain contributes to the environmental goodwill associated with remanufactured products, thereby positively influencing market demand, particularly in contexts characterized by low consumer trust.

A blockchain model connecting electricity market and carbon trading market,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8363092896565019,"Many countries adopt carbon trading mechanism as the main policy tool to control carbon emissions. Although carbon trading systems have been established, there are still some ongoing problems such as inconsistent carbon accounting standards, data distortion and inefficient overall process within these systems. We propose an innovative blockchain model that integrates the carbon trading system, initial carbon allowance allocation by regulatory authorities, electricity consumers, and power generation firms into a unified framework. By connecting these components, the model facilitates government regulation, emission reduction by electricity companies, electricity purchasing by consumers, and trading of surplus carbon allowances in the carbon market. The key innovations of our model include the establishment of a standardized carbon accounting system, enhanced data transparency to reduce the risk of data falsification, and a two-stage differential game framework that optimizes social welfare through effective control of total carbon emissions.

Assessing the viability of blockchain technology in renewable energy supply chains: A consolidation framework,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7640949818212449,"The growing focus on sustainability has propelled heightened scrutiny toward energy supply chains. Blockchain technology stands poised to revolutionize these chains, introducing stability-enhancing factors. Nevertheless, like other nascent technologies, blockchain's integration, while laden with advantages, poses challenges across technical, stakeholder, environmental, and governmental domains within the energy supply chain. Consequently, a thorough assessment of blockchain's applicability in supply chains is imperative for informed decision-making among supply chain managers. However, disparate decision-making methodologies often yield divergent outcomes. Given the substantial costs involved, particularly in capital, adopting blockchain technology in the energy supply chain demands precision. To address this complexity, this study develops a consolidation framework grounded in efficiency, risk, and uncertainty considerations to harmonize the diverse evaluations of blockchain adoption viability in renewable energy supply chains.

Does blockchain-based traceability system guarantee information authenticity? An evolutionary game approach,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"While blockchain-based traceability systems in agricultural product supply chains (APSCs) have the potential to improve operational efficiency and food safety, little literature examined the risk of traceability information being falsified before it is recorded on the blockchain. Therefore, using an evolutionary game model, this paper studies the potential falsification risk in the blockchain-based traceability system for agricultural products. The model focuses on the evolutionary path of two key stakeholders: farmers who may falsify information and blockchain platforms that may verify the authenticity of the information. Factors including government supervision and market demand are also considered. The results demonstrate that: (1) the evolutionary stable strategy of the game model depends on whether both stakeholders can benefit from information falsification after taking into account related costs and penalties; (2) when the purchasers' preference for product freshness and well-known places of origin is sufficiently high, farmers will consistently engage in the information falsification, with the platform allowing such behavior to persist; (3) if the downstream stakeholders attach importance to the authenticity of traceability information recorded on the blockchain, this will reduce farmers' willingness to falsify information and increase blockchain platforms’ willingness to verify authenticity; these two effects can lead to situations where the optimal evolutionary stable strategy exists. Based on the results, we discuss the details of blockchain-enabled audits to curb information falsification.

The impact of consumer skepticism on blockchain-enabled sustainability disclosure in a supply chain,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The growing recognition of sustainable supply chain practices is indisputable. Nevertheless, consumer skepticism regarding the credibility of product sustainability information, which includes environmental impact and social responsibility, poses a significant challenge.

In this paper, a game-theoretical model is developed to investigate the investment strategy in blockchain-enabled disclosure within a supply chain composed of one retailer and two manufacturers, each selling products with varying levels of sustainability. Considering consumer skepticism, we assume that consumers who trust sustainability information are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products, while skeptical consumers are not. Our analysis suggests that blockchain-enabled disclosure can effectively increase consumer trust in sustainability information and promote sustainable practices. However, our findings reveal a potential pitfall: intensified market competition between manufacturers, leading to reduced profits for both, while the retailer persistently benefits from blockchain-enabled disclosure. Furthermore, we find non-monotonic effects of consumer skepticism on retailer and manufacturer profits, with certain conditions resulting in a decreased likelihood of investing in blockchain-enabled disclosure as skepticism increases.

Politicization of e-voting rejection: reflections from Kazakhstan,2020,2,Topic_2_voting_electronic_voting systems,0.40469585414513704,"Purpose Despite certain political, organizational, technological and socioeconomic benefits that e-voting brings, governments around the world are beginning one by one to denounce its further use in the electoral process. In this regard, the paper aims to analyze reasons that led to the discontinuation of e-voting, resorting to the case of Kazakhstan, a transitional post-soviet country, which actively used the technology in 2004-2011, as a poster child of the global trend, elaborating on key political, socioeconomic, organizational and technological risks that could be associated with the possible return of this innovation in future elections. Design/methodology/approach The research is based on the combination of context and policy analysis, as well as focus groups studies and semi-structured interviews. The context analysis was aimed to understand various political and socioeconomic benefits in adopting e-voting in Kazakhstan. The policy analysis was useful in identifying implementation strategies of the government in promoting e-voting. The focus groups were helpful in understanding the perspectives of various audiences on e-voting. The semi-structured interviews were carried among independent developers in regard to the potential software products that could be used to propose new solutions in the area, including by experimenting with various blockchain platforms. Findings Analyzing the lessons from Kazakhstan, one can conclude that e-voting was introduced and used for several years by authorities in this country for certain economic and organizational benefits, but later they had to reject it and return to traditional paper ballot due to lack of confidence from the non-governmental sector in the capacity of public sector to ensure the integrity of e-voting procedures. As a result, building trust and applying innovative approaches should be a priority for policymakers in the area, if they wish to return to this technology, especially in adopting new presumably more reliable solutions based on blockchain technologies. Research limitations/implications The primary data that was collected by the author from field studies were indexed, refined and presented in a special matrix in a separate section, which were interpreted in the discussion session. These data could be used by other scholars for further interpretation and analysis in their own studies, setting new research agendas and testing hypotheses. This is a single case study research, which is focused on the analysis of reasons that led to the denunciation of e-voting in Kazakhstan, which results could be extrapolated mostly to similar transitional post-totalitarian settings. Practical implications The study can be used to inform ways of how to improve the current e-voting platforms, especially in ensuring better security and transparency of the systems, which could be useful for developers who work on blockchain-driven solutions. Social implications The results of the case study research and expert opinions expressed by various software developers in the e-government areas, which were presented in the paper, could be used by both an academic community and practitioners in understanding better a wide range of political, organizational, economic, social and technological drivers, risks and new opportunities in promoting e-voting technology as a trust generating social phenomenon.

An approach using design science research,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.777035864682553,"Purpose Information systems (IS) play an important role in contemporary society, but critical questions remain on their potential use and impact on democracy. This study aims to contribute to the discussion on which technology can be adequate to which major challenge of democratic governance, through the identification and pairing of challenges of democratic governance with specific information technologies with the potential to be used in applications related to this challenge. This perspective can be considered positioned in the confluence between IS, political science and public administration. Design/methodology/approach Design science research, a research approach in IS, was used. The suggestion of a conceptual framework with pairs of challenges in democratic governance and information technologies was initially developed. In a subsequent phase, this framework was discussed and assessed through interviews with a panel of selected experts in e-government and IS, reaching a revised conceptual framework. Findings Results suggest that the conceptual pairing of challenges in democratic governance with IS’s solutions such as artificial intelligence, systems integration or blockchain technologies, for instance, if used in a critical, transparent and accountable way, can play a role in capacitating the delivery of better public services and contribute to encouraging citizen trust and political participation. These results may contribute to open a methodological agenda dedicated to the selection of adequate IS resources to address specific challenges of democratic governance, as well as to help in the development of public policies in the area. Originality/value Previous studies on digital government offer important insights on the impact of information and communication technologies-enabled public governance tools for government openness, public service efficiency and user-friendliness, and for citizen political participation and societal mobilization. But the literature still lacks a systematic conceptual framework mapping and assessing the role of distinctive IS instruments in democratic challenge-solving and specifying functional relationships between specific technology and democratic outcomes. This paper aims to contribute to filling this analytical gap.",10.1108/TG-03-2020-0045,"Anastasiadou, Maria; Santos, Vitor; Montargil, Filipe"

How does fintech affect bank risk? A perspective based on financialized transfer of government implicit debt risk,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8072512339307502,"The relationship between government implicit debt risk and bank risk has drawn much academic attention. Prior studies have documented the mixed effect of fintech on financial stability, and little attention has been paid to its impact in the presence of government implicit debt risk. This paper investigates the impact of fintech on the transfer of governments' implicit debt risk to commercial banks using bank-level data of Chinese commercial banks from 2014 to 2019. With manually collected financial blockchain policy data, we find that the financial blockchain curbs the spillover of government implicit debt risk to commercial banks. The widening of LGFVs financing channels and generation of the real economic effects are proven to be two crucial mechanisms. Inhibitory effects are heterogeneous between different levels of regional financial and digital economic development and officials’ promotion pressure.

A game-theoretical approach for the adoption of government-supported blockchain application in the IoT-enabled agricultural supply chain,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9584602295504177,"Establishing a reliable, cost-effective, and data-accessible supply chain is a requirement for all administrations. The significance of such a supply chain lies in its ability to strengthen national resiliency, ensure economic security, and foster sustainable growth. Governments know financial investments and subsidies in infrastructure, logistics, and technology are necessary for a robust supply chain. This paper proposes an IoT-enabled agricultural supply chain that integrates with a cooperative Nash game between two parties: telecommunications operators and agricultural enterprises. The aim is to establish cooperative decision-making procedures in advance of the integration of blockchain technology into the supply chain, which is regulated by the subsidy policy of the government. The Nash game yields a unique Nash equilibrium, indicating that both parties can engage in cooperative negotiations regarding their participation in the blockchain application to maximize their financial profits. To illustrate the efficacy of Nash collaboration in blockchain adoption, this study presents two scenarios where non-cooperative behavior is explored to analyze stakeholder responses in competitive contexts. Numerical results justify the theoretical findings and suggest Nash cooperation among stakeholders instead of competition in the blockchain-based agri-food market, which leads to a more accessible market environment that ultimately benefits consumers. Moreover, the positive and negative aspects of the deployment of the government-supported blockchain application are derived through sensitivity analyses conducted on subsidy rate, agricultural market price, subsidy amount, and blockchain market. Practical managerial implications are derived from the findings and observations to help policymakers formulate blockchain policies in agricultural supply chains supported by governments.",10.1016/j.iot.2024.101163,"Hamidoğlu, Ali; Gül, Ömer Melih; Kadry, Seifedine Nimer"

Unveiling the role of supply chain parameters approved by blockchain technology towards firm performance through trust: The moderating role of government support,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9319609791578491,"This research study aims to reveal the role of supply chain parameters approved by blockchain technology toward firm performance through trust. This study has also examined the moderating role of government support between trust and firm performance. The underlying theories reinforce the usefulness and flexibility of a supply chain in regulating daily fluctuations and uncertainties in supply and demand. Blockchain technology adoption with supply chain tactics provides a more suitable environment for better firm performance. Governments address legal and security concerns related to blockchain technology and provide clear guidelines and standards for its use in supply chains, which build trust among firms and stakeholders. A conceptual model has been developed with the assistance of past empirical research studies and associated theories. This research study has examined the following relationships from a sample of 465 employees from textile industrial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. The current research study assesses these parameters using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. The analysis showed that supply chain parameters (alignment, agility, adaptability) approved by blockchain technology positively correlate with firm performance. Trust positively mediated the relationship between supply chain parameters approved by blockchain technology and firm performance. Furthermore, government support positively moderated the relationship between trust and firm performance. The study would provide directions for further research. These findings will give the global supply chain industry valuable insights into blockchain technology for firm performance.

MedBioCh: Advancing security and privacy in digital healthcare with revocable biometric systems and blockchain,2025,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.9312249428267743,"The digitization of healthcare has enhanced efficiency, accessibility, and patient management but has also raised critical concerns regarding data security, privacy, and system reliability. As digital services expand, ensuring secure identity management and protecting sensitive health data from cyber threats has become paramount. Traditional centralized health systems remain vulnerable to data breaches, single points of failure, and identity theft, highlighting the need for more resilient solutions. To address these challenges, we propose MedBioCh, a Medical Access Control System Based on Biometrics and BlockChain. MedBioCh system leverages blockchain technology and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for tamper-resistant storage and decentralized data management. It integrates biometric authentication for secure access control, ensuring privacy and identity protection. The proposed system relies on a fully secured biometric architecture through an innovative method for extracting revocable biometric features, based on Gabor filters and chaotic systems. This approach enhances the protection of biometric templates, prevents identity theft and unauthorized access, while maintaining system flexibility and adaptability. The chaotic system parameters are optimized to ensure accurate feature analysis, with attention directed toward the most distinctive traits, thereby improving authentication reliability and robustness. The effectiveness of the MedBioCh system was validated using a standard biometric dataset and implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. Experimental results show that MedBioCh system significantly improves security, fault tolerance, and scalability, mitigating the risks associated with traditional digital health systems. These improvements position MedBioCh system as a practical and effective solution for critical multi-stakeholder sectors such as healthcare, finance, and government, where data protection and integrity are of utmost importance.",10.1016/j.jisa.2025.104170,"Belhocine, Yacine; Meraoumia, Abdallah; Bendjenna, Hakim; Laimeche, Lakhdar; BinSaeedan, Wojdan; Alhoshan, Waad; Gasmi, Mohamed"
Towards the Development of a Blockchain System for Philippine Government Processes for Enhanced Transparency and Verifiability,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"There are cases of corruption and fraud within the Philippine government that have gone under the radar, often due to a lack of transparency and verifiability. The objective of this study is to prototype a blockchain network that can run a government process as a decentralized application such that it can enhance transparency and verifiability in the public sector. This can be accomplished by identifying a government process that would be converted into a decentralized application. One of these processes would be converted into a decentralized application. Afterwards, a blockchain framework should be identified — one which can create a public permissioned blockchain network. This framework can be used to design and implement the prototype blockchain network which the decentralized application can run on. The final prototype constitutes of smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum test network with a web frontend to easily interact with it. Mechanisms of the application that are deemed necessary to transparency and verifiability of the system are also identified. Finally, the variable cost of the system and possible limitation is explored in the paper. In this regard, the prototype offers a foundation with which other decentralized applications can follow and build upon. This is to promote transparency and verifiability within and among government processes.",10.1016/j.procs.2023.01.270,"Cabugwang, Karlo Angelo F.; Enriquez, Raphael Christen K.; Villabroza, Bienvenido E.; Pulmano, Christian E."
What advantages of blockchain affect its adoption in the elderly care industry?

To improve the efficiency of adopting this technology in the ECI and to facilitate decision-making by managers, this study combines the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology–organisation–environment framework models to study the factors affecting blockchain adoption intention in the ECI. In addition, the direct predictors of the relative advantages of blockchain technology in the ECI are explored. Through a questionnaire survey of 124 elderly care institutions in China, we collected 181 valid questionnaires and analysed them using a partial least squares regression structural equation model. The results show that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility, top management support and organisational readiness have a positive effect on blockchain adoption intention in the ECI, while the effects of complexity, government support and competitive pressure are insignificant. However, competitive pressure and government support can indirectly promote blockchain adoption intention by influencing top management support. Furthermore, technology trust and information security positively affect the relative advantages of blockchain technology and indirectly affect blockchain adoption intention, while privacy protection is insignificant.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101786,"Lu, Liyan; Liang, Changyong; Gu, Dongxiao; Ma, Yiming; Xie, Yuguang; Zhao, Shuping"

Blockchain-Based Framework for Secure Sharing of Cross-Border Trade Data,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6209293737184916,"The advent of the digital age has consistently provided impetus for facilitating global trade, as evidenced by the numerous customs clearance documents and participants involved in the international trade process, including enterprises, agents, and government departments. However, the urgent issue that requires immediate attention is how to achieve secure and efficient cross-border data sharing among these government departments and enterprises in complex trade processes. In addressing this need, this paper proposes a data exchange architecture employing Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE) in combination with blockchain technology. This scheme supports proxy decryption, attribute revocation, and policy update, while allowing each participating entity to manage their keys autonomously, ensuring system security and enhancing trust among participants. In order to enhance system decentralization, a mechanism has been designed in the architecture where multiple institutions interact with smart contracts and jointly participate in the generation of public parameters. Integration with the multi-party process execution engine Caterpillar has been shown to boost the transparency of cross-border information flow and cooperation between different organizations. The scheme ensures the auditability of data access control information and the visualization of on-chain data sharing. The MA-ABE scheme is statically secure under the q-Decisional Parallel Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent (q-DPBDHE2) assumption in the random oracle model, and can resist ciphertext rollback attacks to achieve true backward and forward security. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the appropriateness of the scheme for cross-border data collaboration between different institutions.",10.32604/cmc.2025.062324,"Xiao, Shenjian; Qin, Xiaoli; Tian, Yanzhao; Dang, Zhongkai"
Can blockchain help curb “greenwashing” in green finance? - Based on tripartite evolutionary game theory,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8763404652560304,"To encourage enterprises to take green innovation, the Chinese government has been promoting the development of green finance. However, it has brought about the risk of “greenwashing”. This article analyzes “greenwashing” from the perspective of government intervention, focusing on the stakeholder theory and institutional theory that influence the decision-making of participants in green finance, constructing a three-party evolutionary game model for enterprises, green financial institutions, and local governments. By comparing the stable strategy changes before and after the introduction of blockchain technology, the mechanism of blockchain in addressing the “greenwashing” risk in green finance is discussed. The study shows that: first, government regulation plays a crucial role in stimulating enterprises to engage in green innovation and encouraging green financial institutions to provide financial services; Second, before the application of blockchain technology, low-intensity regulation cannot curb the “greenwashing” of enterprises and fails to stimulate them to engage in green innovation. However, after applying blockchain technology, even under low-intensity regulation, enterprises will actively engage in green innovation under the reputation mechanism constructed in the architecture of a consortium chain. This work provides a theoretical framework and guidance for subsequent scholars to conduct quantitative research on the resolution of “greenwashing” in green finance from a government perspective using blockchain.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140447,"Li, Shanliang; Chen, Ruixuan; Li, Zonghuo; Chen, Xiangfeng"
A blockchain-based platform for ensuring provenance and traceability of donations for cultural heritage,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8423085654606439,"The preservation and restoration of cultural heritage has acquired increasing attention in recent years since it has priceless value from both historical and touristic points of view. However, this activity requires considerable funds to be carried out, and frequently, such costs cannot rely entirely on public sources. At the same time, crowdfunding platforms are becoming a widely recognized way to collect funds and finance projects. Indeed, in the literature, some attempts have been made to use crowdfunding platforms to support renovation and restoration projects for cultural heritage items. Even if the benefits of their use in general, particularly for cultural heritage, are widely recognized, skepticism remains regarding transparency, reliability, and trustworthiness. In this regard, the emerging blockchain technology could represent an innovative solution for promoting and guaranteeing such properties through the entire crowdfunding process. However, existing solutions based on the direct use of cryptocurrencies for collecting funds have encountered users' fear and reluctance due to their novelty and the absence of clear and complete regulation by governments. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a solution that is not based on using cryptocurrencies but concentrates on the immutability, traceability, and trustworthiness properties that blockchain offers. To do so, an integrated solution is proposed that combines traditional platforms with a set of smart contracts and a Decentralized Application (dApp), allowing the immutable storage of information inside the blockchain and their subsequent validation by the donors.",10.1016/j.bcra.2025.100278,"Migliorini, Sara; Gambini, Mauro; Belussi, Alberto"

Supply chain finance: What are the challenges in the adoption of blockchain technology?,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9165025683001581,"As an emerging information technology, blockchain has aroused extensive discussions around the world and been suggested as a solution to address current issues in supply chain finance (SCF). The Chinese government also attaches great importance to this technology, and many Chinese state-owned enterprises have invested in establishing their own blockchain research and development centres. However, there is a lack of studies on identifying challenges when deploying this technology; theoretical framework and conceptual exposition are also scarcely seen. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the challenges and obstacles in the adoption of blockchain technology in SCF. An exploratory case study of a Chinese state-owned enterprise was conducted to build up an initial conceptual framework. Semi-structured interview was applied to collect data from the case firm's employees, top management, and technical specialists. The results of the analysis indicate that in the adoption of blockchain technology, there are technological, operational, and other challenges. From a technological perspective, framework identification, cross-chain interoperability, and data governance are major barriers; whereas, from an operational perspective, the new business process and transformation in the entire supply chain are identified as challenges.

Platform developers in the aid sector have been eager to showcase the promise of decentralization and encrypted blockchain data as the inheritance of the world’s poor and developing nations. This article claims that humanitarian blockchain projects are inextricably linked to the politics of the crypto-economy, proprietary platforms, and a class of solutionists championing Silicon Valley’s cultural values. Blockchain humanitarianism has emerged through a private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector that embraces tech disruption and innovation. Ethically sound blockchain humanitarian projects are precluded by the inherent obscurantism of the technology, the inability to transpose blockchain’s governance logic in the social realm, and inextricable ties to the political economy of cryptocurrencies. Projects in the developing world have thus embodied a colonial logic of techno-experimentation for platform developers and imbricate the NGO sector into the PR logic of blockchain solutionism.",10.1016/j.patter.2021.100422,"Jutel, Olivier"
"Anticipate, automate, accelerate: A framework for blockchain in anticipatory action",2024,-1,Outliers,0.039280775024055394,"Anticipatory action (AA) refers to a series of interventions executed when a hazard presents imminent danger, as indicated by forecasts, early warnings, or pre-disaster risk analyses. It involves proactive measures undertaken by individuals or organizations before an expected disaster to lessen its impact on people, assets, and infrastructure likely to be affected. An increasing array of inter-governmental bodies, governments, United Nations entities, global non-governmental organizations, and Red Cross and Red Crescent movements, have been delving into and utilizing anticipatory action. It has been heralded globally by governments, donors and organizations alike as being a more protective, practical, and cost-effective method of disaster risk management. However, ongoing pilots by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and partners have exposed a significant level of friction between the capacity and speed of existing systems and stakeholders to execute these processes in a manner that is synchronized and timely enough to have the intended impact. This research investigates the potential of blockchain technology to streamline AA programs. It analyzes existing academic and non-academic sources (scholarly and gray literature) to develop a framework for identifying which blockchain applications can be most beneficial. By viewing smart contracts, data oracles, and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a toolbox, the framework examines how these technologies can be used to digitize and simplify AA processes. For AA practitioners, this approach offers a practical solution to potentially increase efficiency and speed within existing program structures. Additionally, it may have the secondary benefit of simplifying cash transfer delivery. Ultimately, this piece seeks to be more thought-provoking than prescriptive; as both areas of work (AA and blockchain technology) are continuously evolving, hopefully new cross-sectoral collaborations can ensue and provide more granular insights on what AA and blockchain synergies look like in practice.",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2024.104644,"Uwantege Hart, Sandra; Jones, Catherine; Carvalho, Beatriz"
Platform information sharing and selling contract strategies with blockchain adoption,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The recent rapid development of blockchain technology has drawn considerable attention. To examine the impact of blockchain on platform supply chains, we construct a supply chain consisting of two suppliers and an e-commerce platform. Each supplier may use either a reselling or an agency selling contract; therefore, three scenarios are possible: pure agency selling, pure reselling, or hybrid contracts. Considering blockchain’s role in eliminating transaction costs and achieving demand information transparency, we apply a game theory model to study each player’s pricing strategy and profits when blockchain and selling contract strategies vary. We find that the platform’s optimal selling contract and blockchain strategies strongly depend on commission rates, competition intensity, and transaction costs. Suppliers are willing to join the blockchain to gain demand information and reduce transaction costs. With low transaction costs and high competition intensity, the platform may ally itself with the agency supplier and authorize him to join the blockchain to maximize profits, which may ruin social welfare. From a social welfare perspective, we find that a pure agency contract is optimal, whereas the optimal blockchain strategy varies. Specifically, blockchain adoption may not benefit social welfare even when its operations costs are negligible. We further explore a scenario in which two suppliers can choose their selling contracts to derive insights into suppliers’ contract choices and government subsidy policies. Moreover, we explore the impact of marginal production costs on the optimal strategy for platforms.",10.1016/j.cie.2023.109506,"Wu, Jianghua; Yu, Jiahao; Wang, Xin"

Blockchain technology applications in maintaining heritage buildings,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Preservation of cultural heritage in the face of human and natural disasters, as well as improper maintenance practices, is a crucial endeavor that must be undertaken throughout the lifespan of heritage buildings. In order to maximize the value derived from these assets and strike a harmonious balance between accurate documentation and performance optimization, asset management strategies have been employed. In recent years, the advent of innovative methodologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) and laser scanning has opened new possibilities for their application in various contexts. However, successful implementation of these methodologies faces a range of challenges, including limited knowledge, inexperienced teams, and reluctance to embrace change on the part of administrators. To address these obstacles and enhance asset management practices, the integration of BIM, Chatbot, and Blockchain methodology has emerged as a viable solution. This methodology not only facilitates the improvement of data security and user data capture but also streamlines the process of updating BIM models. In this research, we propose a data-driven Chatbot framework based on Blockchain, specifically designed to manage maintenance activities through the utilization of BIM. The proposed framework serves as a valuable tool for government authorities and asset managers seeking to adopt BIM for the preservation of heritage buildings. Comprising three key components – the BIM model, the Blockchain model, and the Chatbot model – the framework offers comprehensive support. The BIM model encompasses all relevant information pertaining to the management of the heritage building, while the Chatbot model replicates human interaction through text-based communication. Users can access up-to-date BIM data by posing predefined questions to the Chatbot. On the other hand, the Blockchain model serves as a secure and immutable record-keeping system, validating and verifying user updates, thereby fostering trust among stakeholders. This proposed model empowers asset stakeholders to request and update asset information via a trusted and reliable channel. To showcase the capabilities of the framework, we present a real-world case study centered on the Omar Toson Palace in Cairo, Egypt. Through this case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our proposed framework in meeting the challenges associated with heritage building preservation.",10.1016/j.culher.2024.02.005,"Marzouk, Mohamed; Labib, Nouran; Metawie, Mahmoud"
Should blockchain be used to eliminate greenwashing for green and live-streaming platform operations under carbon trading systems?,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"This study examines a supply chain comprising a live-streaming platform and a manufacturer that sells its products via the platform in the agency or resale mode. Under the carbon trading system, the manufacturer adopts green technology and exhibits the greenwashing behaviour, and the platform chooses whether to use blockchain to eliminate this behaviour. We find that the existence of greenwashing generates a higher profit for the platform in the agency mode. In the resale mode, the existence of greenwashing generates a higher (lower) profit for the platform if the additional profit brought by blockchain is low (high) at a low or moderate cap. However, when the cap is high, the existence of greenwashing hurts the platform’s profit. Furthermore, considering the government’s decision, we find that the existence of greenwashing hurts (improves) the social welfare at a high (low) correlation coefficient between the carbon trading price and potential market demand.",10.1016/j.ejor.2025.02.017,"Xu, Xiaoping; Chen, Xinru; Cheng, T.C.E.; Choi, Tsan-Ming; Yang, Yuanyuan"
Investment in enhancing resilience safety of chemical parks under blockchain technology: From the perspective of dynamic reward and punishment mechanisms,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.837169286987933,"Industry and academia have long focused on safety risk management in chemical parks, and resilient safety is becoming a new goal for risk and emergency management in parks. In the context of blockchain, what is the behavioral law of chemical enterprises investing for resilient safety is a scientific question that needs to be studied urgently. This paper effectively combines prospect theory, mental account and evolutionary game theory, considers the herd effect, establishes a hypothetical model of limited rationality of chemical park resilience safety investment actors (core enterprises, supporting enterprises and local government regulators), analyzes the evolutionary stabilization strategies of the core enterprises, supporting enterprises and local government regulators under the static and dynamic rewards and punishments mechanisms, and finally, further conducts a Finally, numerical simulation analysis is further carried out. The results show that (1) the resilient safety investment of chemical park enterprises is jointly influenced by multiple factors, including external incentives and subjective factors of decision makers. (2) The government's dynamic reward and punishment mechanism can more effectively incentivize enterprises to invest in resilience safety. (3) Reducing the psychological pressure among supporting enterprises and reducing the influence of herd effect can push the system to tend to the state of positive investment. The marginal contribution of this paper is to reveal the evolution law of chemical park resilience safety investment behavior under blockchain technology. The findings provide empirical evidence for promoting resilient safety investment in chemical parks and enhancing the level of resilient safety in the parks.",10.1016/j.jlp.2024.105523,"Su, Chang; Deng, Jun; Li, Xiaoyang; Huang, Wenhong; MA, jiayi; Wang, Caiping; Wang, Xinping"
The heterogeneity of consumer preference for blockchain-based food traceability: The role of governmental trust and information-seeking behaviour,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.953713734619856,"Recent incidents of food fraud and growing concerns about sustainability in food production have led to increased consumer preference for food traceability. Governments, responsible for enforcing food traceability regulations and overseeing food systems, play a crucial role in this context. Consequently, trust in government could significantly influence consumer behaviour and their valuation of food traceability systems. Blockchain (BC) technology, recently implemented in food traceability, has gained popularity due to its potential to create a “trustless” trust environment. This study aims to understand how consumers with varying levels of trust in the government value BC-based traceability systems. An online choice experiment (n = 707) focused on Greek feta cheese was conducted to explore this relationship. Four consumer segments were identified, profiled, and labelled as Engaged, Sceptic, Vigilant, and Reliant. The findings reveal that consumers with low trust in government and a high tendency to seek product information place a high value on BC-based food traceability compared to other labelling schemes. Conversely, consumers who trust the government and do not actively seek product information show a preference for the well-known PDO certification over food traceability labels. These results highlight the potential for promoting BC-based traceability among consumers, as a sizeable segment demonstrates interest in such traceable products.",10.1016/j.foodqual.2024.105424,"Tran, Duc; De Steur, Hans; Gellynck, Xavier; Papadakis, Andreas; Schouteten, Joachim J."

Blockchain for energy market: A comprehensive survey,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9719327251642996,"The energy market encompasses the behavior of energy supply and trading within a platform system. By utilizing centralized or distributed trading, energy can be effectively managed and distributed across different regions, thereby achieving market equilibrium and satisfying both producers and consumers. Additionally, the energy market can address future production control and environmental concerns such as energy shortages and environmental deterioration. However, recent years have presented unprecedented challenges and difficulties for the development of the energy market. These challenges include regional energy imbalances, volatile energy pricing, high computing costs, and issues related to transaction information disclosure. These factors have hindered the smooth operation of the energy market. Researchers widely acknowledge that the security features of blockchain technology can enhance the efficiency of energy transactions and establish the fundamental stability and robustness of the energy market. This type of blockchain-enabled energy market is commonly referred to as an energy blockchain. Currently, there is a burgeoning amount of research in this field, encompassing algorithm design, framework construction, and practical application. It is crucial to organize and compare these research efforts to facilitate the further advancement of energy blockchain. This survey aims to comprehensively review the fundamental characteristics of blockchain and energy markets, highlighting the significant advantages of combining the two. Moreover, based on existing research outcomes, we will categorize and compare the current energy market research supported by blockchain in terms of algorithm design, market framework construction, and the policies and practical applications adopted by different countries.

Pricing and greenness investment for green products with government subsidies: When to apply blockchain technology?,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Green products have received increasing attention by firms and consumers in recent years, but consumers are often uncertain about the valuation of green products. To solve this problem, many firms have utilized blockchain technology to provide transparent and traceable information for their products. This study examines optimal strategies for pricing and ‘greenness’ investment for green products with government subsidies and explores the conditions for adopting blockchain technology. First, we find that both retailers and consumers always benefit from a manufacturer’s adoption of blockchain technology. When the blockchain’s operational cost is small or the consumer valuation uncertainty is high, the social welfare outcome will be positive after the adoption of blockchain technology. Second, although blockchain can reduce the valuation uncertainty for consumers, the demand in the blockchain-supported supply chain is not always higher than that in the traditional supply chain. In addition, when a government subsidizes either the manufacturer or the consumer, adopting blockchain is still profitable for the manufacturer even if the operational cost of blockchain technology is relatively large. However, the result is quite different when the government subsidizes the retailer. In the retailer subsidy program, the manufacturer’s adoption of blockchain technology hinges on the level of consumer valuation uncertainty.",10.1016/j.elerap.2021.101108,"Xu, Jian; Duan, Yongrui"

A discrete choice experiment with 1037 valid responses in China produced interesting results. Blockchain serves as a weakening role for personal trust, whereas a reinforcing role for system trust on consumers’ intention to purchase organic food.

Blockchain as a driving force for federalism: A theory of cross-organizational task-technology fit,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7497483810788145,"Digital technologies play an important role for the delivery of many public services. However, selecting and adopting the ‘right’ digital technologies is often challenging, especially for federally structured governments. Universal factors for successful adoption are hard to establish, and the particularities of federalism, such as the separation of competencies, complicate technology selection. Nevertheless, blockchain technology seems to flourish in these environments. Through a single-case study on the blockchain project of Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, we unpack one essential factor for this success: the fit between (cross-)organizational task structure and technological properties. This fit earns the Federal Office’s project considerable credit and traction with stakeholders and partner authorities – not least because it supports the argument that the digitalization of federal systems is possible without ‘digital centralization’ and redistribution of competencies. Our task-technology fit analysis contributes to a better understanding of the adoption of blockchain in the public sector.

Combating counterfeits with the Blockchain-technology-supported platform under government enforcement,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9791512056957133,"The intrinsic value of brand names has led to the widespread presence of counterfeits in multi-industries. Although government enforcement plays a role in combating counterfeits, it is difficult to fundamentally curb counterfeiting. This paper examines how the brand-name firm adopts the blockchain-technology-supported (BTS) platform in dealing with counterfeits under government enforcement. We consider a market with a manufacturer (i.e., a brand-name firm) and a counterfeiter. First, we develop a signaling game model to analyze the negative impact of deceptive sales. The results show that, under weak government enforcement and a high rampancy level of counterfeits, deceptive sales will decrease the expected demand for authentic products, the manufacturer’s expected profit, the expected consumer surplus, and the expected social welfare. Although government enforcement forces the counterfeiter to implement non-deceptive sales, it will decrease the expected consumer surplus under symmetric quality information. Then, we develop a Stackelberg game model to analyze the manufacturer’s adoption strategy for the BTS platform. We find that weaker government enforcement will incentivize the manufacturer to adopt the BTS platform. However, the manufacturer does not always adopt the BTS platform even if the counterfeiter implements deceptive sales. Finally, we analyze the effect of adopting the BTS platform under government enforcement. We reveal that the role of the BTS platform in improving consumer rights is stronger than that in combating counterfeits, and the effect of adopting the BTS platform will strengthen as government enforcement weakens.",10.1016/j.tre.2023.103155,"He, Chao; Tan, Chunqiao; Ip, W.H.; Wu, C.H."
Sustainable strategies for marine plastic waste remanufacturing systems under diverse carbon reduction policies,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9326216723784599,"This study examines the challenges facing the marine plastic waste remanufacturing industry in improving ecological outcomes and reducing carbon emissions. It focuses on how to effectively incentivize the front-line collectors to participate in and comply with government carbon policies. Using a differential game framework, we analyze the effects of various carbon reduction policies and revenue-sharing mechanisms on waste management performance, carbon mitigation, and blockchain adoption. The results show that under a carbon tax policy, suppliers adopting fixed-price acquisition strategies invest more in blockchain implementation and carbon reduction. When carbon taxes are low, increasing them significantly improves waste management performance and supplier-level emission reductions. Manufacturers' carbon reduction efforts also rise with higher carbon taxes. Blockchain adoption enhances profitability across stakeholders in the system. Among the two carbon policies examined—the carbon tax and the carbon cap—the carbon tax yields the most effective outcomes for marine plastic waste management and emission reduction. However, this environmental improvement does not directly translate into higher profits for all supply chain members. An extension of the model demonstrates that cost-sharing contracts can effectively coordinate dynamic collaboration within the supply chain.

The blockchain has always been regarded as the most potential solution for addressing the security and privacy issues of the Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV). The consensus mechanism is the core of the blockchain, it determines the security, efficiency, and scalability of the system. However, consensus mechanisms currently employed in V2V energy trading are traditional algorithms, which are unsuitable for the IoEV due to their high computational power and communication overhead. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a Block Alliance Consensus (BAC) mechanism based on Hashgraph. BAC can maintain the high throughput of the Hashgraph, and it solves the problem that the Hashgraph cannot support the dynamic addition and deletion of nodes if it is directly applied to V2V energy trading. We utilize the sharding technique, and each shard generates a consortium blockchain in accordance with the characteristic of the IoEV. The centralized component is retained to ensure macroeconomic control by state and local governments. We design a cryptography-based leader election combined with a reputation incentive mechanism to fairly elect centralized leader committee and motivate honest electric vehicles (EVs).

Blockchain enabled e-voting system adoption: examining the mediating role of perceived transparency,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Purpose Transparency is one of the finest characteristics of blockchain technology. As blockchain’s technical enablers are traceable and irreversible, transparency allows for more confidence in the system. This study aims to apply and extend the theoretical model of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) by empirically investigating the factors (performance expectancy, price value, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, social influence and effort expectancy) that influence users’ perceived transparency of blockchain-as-a-service for e-voting and its effect on adoption intention; to investigate the mediating effect of perceived blockchain transparency on the relationship between UTAUT2 antecedents and intention to use blockchain-based e-voting technology; and to investigate Generations Z and Y’s perceptions of how blockchain technology can be implemented to the current e-voting system. Design/methodology/approach The authors primarily used the MTurk crowdsourcing platform to host their online survey and collected 251 valid responses from their targeted participants, which the authors analyzed using Smart PLS 4.0. Findings The findings revealed that users’ perceived expectancy, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions, habit and price value positively influence the perceived transparency of blockchain-as-a-service for e-voting.

Towards efficient privacy and trust in decentralized blockchain-based peer-to-peer renewable energy marketplace,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important as a substitute for fossil energy production. However, distributed renewable energy production faces several challenges regarding trading and management, such as inflexible pricing models and inaccurate green consumption information. A decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity marketplace may address these challenges. It enables prosumers to market their self-produced electricity. However, such a marketplace needs to guarantee that the transactions follow market rules and government regulations, cannot be manipulated, and are consistent with the generated electricity. One of the ways to provide these guarantees is to leverage blockchain technology. This work describes a decentralized blockchain-based P2P energy marketplace addressing privacy, trust, and governance issues. It uses a private permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HF) and its smart contracts to perform energy trading settlements. The suggested P2P marketplace includes a particular regulator actor acting as a governmental representative overseeing marketplace operations. In this way, the suggested P2P marketplace can address the governance issues needed in electricity marketplaces. Further, the proposed marketplace ensures actors’ data privacy by employing HF’s private data collections while preserving the integrity and auditability of all operations. We present an in-depth performance evaluation and provide insights into the security and privacy challenges emerging from such a marketplace. The results demonstrate that partial centralization by the applied regulator does not limit the P2P energy trade settlement execution. Blockchain technology allows for automated marketplace operations enabling better incentives for prosumer electricity production.

The interplay of recycling channel selection and blockchain adoption in the new energy vehicle supply chain under the government reward-penalty scheme,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9084498861040753,"Recently, the rapid progress of the new energy vehicle (NEV) sector has resulted in a growing demand for power batteries. The urgency to find environmentally friendly and efficient methods for recycling retired power batteries has turned into a pressing issue. Therefore, this research proposes four multi-channel recycling models that encompass a battery supplier, a third-party recycler, and a NEV manufacturer. Among them, the battery supplier is subject to the government reward-penalty scheme and adopts blockchain to track information on power batteries. Recycled power batteries are either utilized in echelon utilization or dismantled for raw materials, depending on their varying capacity. We conduct a Stackelberg game analysis to examine the influence of blockchain adoption and government reward-penalty scheme on recycling channel selections, recycling rates, and social, economic, and environmental benefits. Through numerical analysis, the following key findings are obtained: (i) when the recycling price competition degree is relatively low and the sensitivity degree of consumers to the recycling price is relatively high, tripartite participation in recycling can achieve the highest recycling rate and social welfare. (ii) Within a certain range of reward-penalty intensity, the government reward-penalty scheme can significantly augment recycling rates, and lowering the recycling rate target may increase supply chain members' profits. (iii) The efficacy of blockchain adoption enhances the battery supplier's willingness to participate in recycling and the decision to invest in blockchain, which yields ancillary advantages for the NEV manufacturer.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.144384,"Xing, Peng; Wang, Mingxing"
Differential game theoretic analysis of the blockchain technology investment and carbon reduction strategy in digital supply chain with government intervention,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9575278494018842,"In the context of a low-carbon environment and the prevalence design digital supply chain (DSC), the interaction between digital and green has received much attention in supply chain low-carbon practices and academic research. The rising consumer environmental awareness (CEA) and transparency perception (CTP) of green product information have stimulated investments in blockchain technology and green production. However, the improved digital operation level resulting from blockchain technology investment further reduces carbon emissions. Considering these emerging features of DSC, the differential game is employed to investigate blockchain technology investment and green production investment strategies of DSC members from a long-run and dynamic standpoint. This study analyzes and compares DSC equilibrium strategies under four different scenarios. Theoretical results are verified through numerical experiments, and sensitivity analysis is conducted to unlock further insights. The results demonstrate that the digital operation level follows a monotonic trajectory, while the carbon reduction level exhibits no more than one change over time. In addition, CEA stimulates investment in green production and blockchain technology simultaneously. Both CEA and CTP improve the digital operation level, carbon reduction level and overall profit of the DSC. The improved synergic mechanism with bilateral participation is most effective in improving the economic efficiency and environmental benefit of the DSC. The economic advantage of the bilateral synergic mechanism over other mechanisms can be enhanced as CEA and CTP rise. The cost factor of blockchain technology investment and the manufacturer’s marginal benefit more significantly affect the demand and profit of green product.

Simulation result shows neutral ESG policy is optimal. Based on the given neutral ESG policy, we have done the research on ESG investment and decision strategies for platform participants. Our research shows that the tokens selling rate and efforts of green platform (ESG score greater than 0) developers are lower than the ones of brown platform (ESG score less than 0). Consequently, when developers’ token retention is about half of the initial amount, users should invest more brown tokens. Speculators should invest brown tokens for developers’ high token retention. Green token investments of speculators and users are needed in other cases. Next, the impact of the government’s three ESG policies on the maturity or termination of the platform also been analyzed. An important conclusion occurred: the government’s aggressive or conservative ESG policy cannot make the development of the green platform better; Therefore, we suggest a neutral ESG policy which means that the government could adopt high tax incentive and high tax burden on the green and brown platform while it is not necessary to implement the extra subsidy and punishment policy on the green and brown platform.",10.1016/j.najef.2024.102303,"Li, Renzhong; Fei, Chen; Fei, Weiyin"

Exploring the promotion of blockchain adoption in the healthcare industry through government subsidies,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8858599101780444,"Purpose Blockchain technology has been recognized as a potential solution to the challenges in managing healthcare information. Its adoption in the healthcare industry has garnered the attention of healthcare institutions and governments. Given the significant role of subsidies in promoting technology adoption, this study applies evolutionary game theory to examine the impact of government subsidies on the adoption of blockchain technology by healthcare institutions. Design/methodology/approach First, the authors analyze the interests of government administration departments and healthcare institutions separately in regards to blockchain adoption. Subsequently, the authors develop the payoff matrix of both participants and construct the evolutionary game model. And then, the authors calculate the replication dynamic equations and analyze the decision evolution of both participants through the replication dynamic equations and numerical experiments. Findings The numerical experiments demonstrate that government subsidies are effective in encouraging healthcare institutions to adopt blockchain technology. The study also reveals the necessary amount of subsidy required to guide healthcare institutions towards adoption. Additionally, the validity of the evolutionary game model in analyzing the interaction between governments and healthcare institutions is confirmed by the results. Originality/value Blockchain adoption in the healthcare industry differs from other emerging technologies, as there is the potential for it to reduce revenue for healthcare institutions. This study contributes to the analysis of theoretical models for promoting blockchain in the healthcare industry through subsidies. Additionally, it demonstrates the potential of evolutionary game theory in analyzing the adoption of blockchain technology, and the interaction between governments and healthcare institutions.",10.1108/K-04-2023-0683,"Li, Keqing; Liang, Changyong"
Are artificial intelligence and blockchain the key to unlocking the box of clean energy?,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8482959555955094,"The fourth industrial revolution has brought about key technological breakthroughs represented by artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain (BC), which provide an opportunity for the development of clean energy (CE). We employ a wavelet-based quantile-on-quantile approach to investigate the correlation among AI, BC and CE over different periods and time horizons. The results show that although the integration of AI and CE systems requires a lot of time, it can significantly boost CE development in the long run. However, BC cannot significantly promote CE development except for a few extreme periods. Our results are supported by the mechanism of interaction among AI, BC and CE development, which highlights their relationship. Therefore, the government should focus on promoting the development of new information technologies and their integration with the CE system, which is crucial for the implementation of energy transition strategies. In addition, low-carbon investors should focus on these technologies because of their relationship with CE.",10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107616,"Yang, Shengyao; Zhu, Meng Nan; Yu, Haiyan"
A hybrid framework for prioritizing the solutions to mitigate sustainable supply chain barriers in industry 5.0,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.827272904018476,"Industry 5.0 is a potential framework that aims to envision the most advanced industrial, transportation, energy-efficient, and sustainable supply chain (SSC) of the future. Industry 5.0 and SSC are essential ideas that are revolutionizing the operational strategies of enterprises in the modern day. Concurrently, these two principles propel the development of a very sustainable and resilient global economy. Contemporary organizations are increasingly adopting sustainable practices in the supply chain by using technology such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and collaborative robots (co-bots) to trace the source of products, guarantee ethical and sustainable sourcing and procurement, and efficiently and securely collaborate with humans. Focusing on the goal of sustainability, the current study utilized a three-step methodology and a hybrid framework to rank solutions for overcoming SSC barriers in the pharmaceutical industry supply chain. We conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify the barriers and solutions, then finalize them using the Delphi technique. The current study finalized 16 SSC barriers and 14 solutions. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is used to prioritize barriers and calculate the weight of each barrier. The main challenge that obstructs the adoption of SSC into practice is higher initial investment and unclear return on investments. The current study used Extended PROMETHEE II (EXPROM2) for prioritization of SSC solutions. The solution ranking indicates that governmental assistance and public–private partnerships are the most effective approaches for overcoming the listed barriers. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the appropriateness of the final findings of the current study. The current findings will allow organizations to pinpoint the most troublesome barriers and therefore implement solutions that may mitigate their severity.",10.1016/j.clscn.2025.100268,"Kamruzzaman, Md; Karmakar, Anup; Kibria, Md.Golam"
Institutional entrepreneurial orientation: Beyond setting the rules of the game for blockchain technology,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Regulations keep evolving on currency-based blockchain technology, making it difficult for entrepreneurs within this realm to find a home. Going beyond temporal regulations and traditional metrics to help entrepreneurs evaluate formal institutional environments, we apply and extend the theoretical framework of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) to the institutional level (termed institutional EO) to index an institution's innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking towards blockchain technology. Evaluating a country's institutional EO allows entrepreneurs to understand how embedded the institution is within a certain technology (in this case blockchain technology), which in turn, signals to entrepreneurs longer-term havens in which to locate to develop and commercialize the technology.",10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121734,"Cowden, Birton; Tang, Jintong"
Securing Land Registration using Blockchain,2020,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,0.8236682865352059,"The current land registration process involves a lot of vulnerabilities and people uses it to cheat the common people and the government. This paper discusses about a secure land registry implemented using blockchain which works on the basis of majority consensus. By implementing the land registry in blockchain, the security issue is resolved to a great extent. The hash value calculated for each block will be unique as it is linked to the hash of the previous block. The algorithm that is used for hashing is SHA256. Along with SHA256, Proof Of Work(PoW) algorithm is also used which makes the information related to each transaction more secure. Message digest that is generated for each block is of fixed size and each hash represents a complete set of transaction within a given block. The proposed land registry blockchain network consists of 12 nodes which calculates the proof of work. Nodes are responsible for verifying a transaction, mining a new block and adding the new block to the blockchain. A total of 200 land transactions are recorded using the blockchain methodology which offers a tamper proof and updated version of land registry. Elliptic curve cryptographic algorithm is used for signature generation which is used for verifying whether the transaction is signed by the owner or not. Merkle tree is used for linking the transactions using hash and in turn reduces the disk usage. The proposed implementation of land registry using blockchain thus offers a 99% reduction in manual effort spent in record keeping.",10.1016/j.procs.2020.04.183,"S, Krishnapriya; Sarath, Greeshma"
Business financing and blockchain technology adoption in agroindustry,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9238128516384603,"Purpose This paper aims to explore patterns of business financing and adoption of blockchain technology in the agricultural industry. The adoption of blockchain technology in terms of recording, storing, validating and securing data can solve a variety of agricultural problems such as agricultural business financing. If the banking and insurance industries are connected in real-time to activity data in the agricultural industry, they can create better credit ratings and profile models. So, finally, all parties in the agricultural industry have a greater chance to get business financing from banks. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a case study research approach with a framework of analysis of the theory of adoption of technology, organization and environment (TOE) and the theory of “mindfulness of adoption”. The case study method has advantages when verification is still questioned or the application of certain theories in practice as phenomena and contexts that occur in the field in accordance with the application of blockchain technology into a relatively new business, both technically and practically in the field. Findings The findings indicate that there are no barriers to the availability of blockchain technology for technology adoption. The characteristics of this technology are very suitable for solving financing and supply chain business problems in the agricultural industry. However, the adoption of blockchain technology in agriculture shows that there is complexity in the organizational context involving internal and external organizations. The number of organizations and small parties involved in the agricultural process challenges the adoption of blockchain technology as new technology. Then, the external environment of technology, especially government regulations in developing countries, is still an obstacle to the adoption of blockchain technology. Research limitations/implications This study faces several limitations, namely, the limited case of implementation of the blockchain technology due to the novelty of technology and government regulation. So that further research related to the adoption of blockchain technology needs to be done using field data such as surveys. Research related to the connectivity of the banking industry and other financial institutions also needs to be explored further, especially in creating a data-based credit risk model of the blockchain system. Originality/value On the practical side, case studies of technology adoption and its relationship with the financing of agricultural business are still little explored so this study contributes to exploring the application of blockchain technology in the agricultural industry. The adoption of blockchain technology has an impact not only on farmers but also on all parties involved in the supply chain including banks, insurance and other financial institutions. In addition, the distributed data exchange business model using blockchain technology is a new business model in the agriculture industry.",10.1108/JSTPM-03-2020-0065,"Rijanto, Arief"
Impacts of blockchain technology with government subsidies on a dual-channel supply chain for tracing product information,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Transparent product information is a critical factor that promotes product sales. To satisfy the consumers’ expectation of product quality information, in practice, manufacturers (e.g., Beinmate, Aptamil, and Qiao’s compound) have adopted Blockchain Technology (BT) to help consumers trace the associated product information. In addition, the governments also encourage the application of BT by implementing relevant policies. This paper proposes a stylized dual-channel supply chain model to investigate the value added from adopting BT for manufacturers. We consider a setting that a manufacturer sells its product through two channels, i.e., offline retailer and online e-tailer. Under this circumstance, we find that the manufacturer is always willing to adopt BT to disclose product information. In particular, the offline retailer and consumers can receive benefits from this innovation, while the action is a double-edged sword for the online e-tailer. Moreover, under a special scenario that the government offers a quantity/innovation subsidy, we show that there exists a win–win–win situation for the manufacturer, the both selling channels, as well as the consumers. Finally, we compare the two subsidy policies and show that innovation subsidy can always achieve a better social welfare than quantity subsidy. Numerical examples are conducted to select the optimal subsidy policies and examine the extensions of this work.",10.1016/j.tre.2023.103032,"Zhong, Yuanguang; Yang, Tong; Yu, Huilin; Zhong, Shuneng; Xie, Wei"

Smart Contract based Central Sector Scheme of Scholarship for College and University Students,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8112118748386631,"Education plays a vital role in human life. To encourage higher education, the Indian government has taken many initiatives. These include the disbursement of scholarships to financially help the students belonging to low-income families. Central Sector Scheme of Scholarship for College and University Students (CSS) is one such scheme that financially helps meritorious students in pursuing graduation and post-graduation. This scheme was introduced in 2008. Scholarships from CSS have been helping students to fund their educational expenses. But there have been some difficulties faced by the students in availing this scholarship. These include lack of traceability of application form, loss of application form in transit through Indian Postal Service, lack of transparency between students and their respective Education Boards, and lack of bank account verification. In this paper, we propose a Smart Contract for CSS Scheme that overcomes the above-mentioned drawbacks. It has four entities: Students, Education Boards, Colleges, and Banks. The Blockchain-based Smart Contract proposed in this paper, has been developed to provide a user-friendly environment to a student and maintain a transparent and constant connection between students and their respective Education Boards.

Blockchain technology adoption barriers in the Indian agricultural supply chain: an integrated approach,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9084912522644552,"Recent outbreaks of food contamination scandals in India have resulted in increased concerns amongst consumers about food safety. Further, to tackle such circumstances, conformation to quality has become a must in Agriculture Supply Chain (ASC). Agro-stakeholders have tried to accomplish this demand through the integration of technology in ASC. One such technology is blockchain, which is still in its infancy in terms of adoption in India. Fueled by this motivation, we aim to investigate the significant barriers for blockchain adoption in Indian ASC. The constructs are identified through a comprehensive literature search and opinion of domain experts from five agro-organizations, academia, and agro-stakeholders. Further identified construct is modeled using an integrated ISM-DEMATEL approach, which not only interrogates interrelationship amongst identified constructs but also evaluates the intensity of the relationship between them. The identified constructs are also clustered into a suitable group using Fuzzy-MICMAC. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is also performed to check the robustness of the proposed model. The results reveal that “lack of government regulation and lack of trust among agro-stakeholder to use blockchain” are significant adoption barriers of blockchain in Indian ASC.

ACR-MLM: a privacy-preserving framework for anonymous and confidential rewarding in blockchain-based multi-level marketing,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Network marketing is a trading technique that provides companies with the opportunity to increase sales. With the increasing number of Internet-based purchases, several threats are increasingly observed in this field, such as user privacy violations, company owner (CO) fraud, the changing of sold products’ information, and the scalability of selling networks. This study presents the concept of a blockchain-based market called ACR-MLM that functions based on the multi-level marketing (MLM) model, through which registered users receive anonymous and confidential rewards for their own and their subgroups’ sales. Applying a public blockchain as the ACR-MLM framework’s infrastructure solves existing problems in MLM-based markets, such as CO fraud (against the government or its users), user privacy violations (obtaining their real names or subgroup users), and scalability (when vast numbers of users have been registered). To provide confidentiality and scalability to the ACR-MLM framework, hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) was applied with a functional encryption (FE) scheme.

Blockchain technologies to mitigate COVID-19 challenges: A scoping review,2021,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,1.0,"Background: As public health strategists and policymakers explore different approaches to lessen the devastating effects of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), blockchain technology has emerged as a resource that can be utilized in numerous ways. Many blockchain technologies have been proposed or implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to uncover and summarise the main feature of these technologies. Objective: This study aims to explore proposed or implemented blockchain technologies used to mitigate the COVID-19 challenges as reported in the literature. Methods: We conducted a scoping review in line with guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). To identify relevant studies, we searched 11 bibliographic databases (e.g., EMBASE and MEDLINE) and conducted backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. The study selection and data extraction were conducted by 2 reviewers independently. Data extracted from the included studies was narratively summarised and described. Results: 19 of 225 retrieved studies met eligibility criteria in this review. The included studies reported 10 used cases of blockchain to mitigate COVID-19 challenges; the most prominent use cases were contact tracing and immunity passports. While the blockchain technology was developed in 10 studies, its use was proposed in the remaining 9 studies. The public blockchain technology was the most commonly utilized type in the included studies. All together, 8 different consensus mechanisms were used in the included studies. Out of 10 studies that identified the used platform, 9 studies used Ethereum to run the blockchain. Solidity was the most prominent programming language used in developing blockchain technology in the included studies. The transaction cost was reported in only 4 of the included studies and varied between USD 10−10 and USD 5. The expected latency and expected scalability were not identified in the included studies. Conclusion: Blockchain technologies are expected to play an integral role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Many possible applications of blockchain were found in this review; however, most of them are not mature enough to reveal their expected impact in the fight against COVID-19.

Public cognition of the application of blockchain in food safety management—Data from China’s Zhihu platform,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9860568615569792,"Food safety is a worldwide problem, mainly caused by environmental pollution, production and management of enterprises, government supervision failure and other reasons. Blockchain technology, as an emerging technology, has strong pertinency and applicability to food traceability due to its characteristics of decentralization, traceability and immutability. Therefore, it is expected to be effectively applied in food safety management and improve the guarantee level of food safety. However, for some reasons, blockchain has not been widely used in food safety management. So further study on the advantages and challenges of its application is beneficial to the sustainable development of food enterprises, consumers and the government. Its application can provide traceable information for food companies, consumers and governments. This can not only ensure the food safety of enterprises, but also improve the level of government supervision, so as to establish the trust between consumers, enterprises and the government, which improves the efficiency and level of food safety management.

Blockchain-enabled renewable energy certificate trading: A secure and privacy-preserving approach,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9051971124222316,"In the 21st century, transitioning to renewable energy sources is imperative, with fossil fuel reserves depleting rapidly and recognizing critical environmental issues such as climate change, air pollution, water pollution, and habitat destruction. Embracing renewable energy is not only an environmental necessity but also a strategic move with multiple benefits. By shifting to renewable energy sources and supporting their production through the acquisition of renewable energy certificates, we foster innovation and drive economic growth in the renewable energy sector. This, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Additionally, renewable energy certificates ensure compliance with regulations that mandate the use of renewable energy, enhancing legal adherence while promoting transparency and trust in energy sourcing. To monitor the uptake of renewable energy, governments have implemented Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) as a tracking mechanism for the production and consumption of renewable energy. They certify the generation of a specific amount of electricity from renewable sources, allowing for accurate tracking of renewable energy contributions to the overall energy mix. However, there are two main challenges to the existing REC schema: (1) The RECs have not been globally adopted due to inconsistent design; (2) The consumer privacy has not been well incorporated in the design of blockchain. In this study, we investigate the trading of RECs between suppliers and consumers using the directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain system and introduce a trading schema to help protect consumer information. The DAG system reduces the intense calculation of typical blockchains for scalability and lowers mining fees by eliminating the mining of blocks. The proposed approach allows renewable energy suppliers and consumers to trade RECs globally and to take advantage of secure trading transactions. Our results demonstrate lower transaction time by 41% and energy consumption by 65% compared to proof-of-stake.",10.1016/j.energy.2023.130110,"Liu, Wei-Jen; Chiu, Wei-Yu; Hua, Weiqi"
Blockchain as a confidence machine: The problem of trust & challenges of governance,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.945203448441619,"Blockchain technology was created as a response to the trust crisis that swept the world in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems were presented as a “trustless” alternative to existing financial institutions and even governments. Yet, while the trustless nature of blockchain technology has been heavily questioned, little research has been done as to what blockchain technologies actually bring to the table in place of trust. This article draws from the extensive academic discussion on the concepts of “trust” and “confidence” to argue that blockchain technology is not a ‘trustless technology’ but rather a ‘confidence machine’. First, the article provides a review of the multifaceted conceptualisations of trust and confidence, and the relationship between these two concepts. Second, the claim is made that blockchain technology relies on cryptographic rules, mathematics, and game-theoretical incentives in order to increase confidence in the operations of a computational system. Yet, such an increase in confidence ultimately relies on the proper operation and governance of the underlying blockchain-based network, which requires trusting a variety of actors.

The selection of practical dimensions requires both Quantitative indicators also require cultural and behavioral qualitative indicators; finally, through the analysis of social development trends and government policies, the external variable landscape signals are parameterized. Sustainable energy rather than fossil energy is the energy of the future. Weak landscape signals have significantly weakened the development of the sustainable energy niche: the proportion of coal consumption has declined slowly. Although it has transformed from a system to a niche, it has always been higher than that of other energy types. Only with long-term landscape pressure, positive changes to sustainable energy technologies and infrastructure, and continuous changes in consumer preferences, can sustainable energy ultimately dominate.",10.1016/j.egyr.2022.05.002,"Liu, Yishu; Li, Ziyuan; Huang, Lihua"
An empirical study on the adoption of blockchain-based games from users’ perspectives,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9771336048954037,"Purpose The purpose of the research is to investigate users’ adoption of blockchain-based games in China. Design/methodology/approach This research applied existing technology diffusion theories to develop a research model to examine users’ adoption of blockchain-based games. As a result, a research model with nine research hypotheses was developed. The developed research model was empirically tested using data collected from a survey of 210 blockchain-based games users. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyse the collected data. Findings The results indicated that seven of nine research hypotheses were supported. It was found that trust, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use were key determinants for users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games. The most influential relationship in the research model appeared to be the effect of perceived usefulness on users’ behavioural intention to use blockchain-based games.

Unlocking potential of open source model training in decentralized federated learning environment,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, creating a demand for sophisticated models that rely on substantial data and computational resources for training. However, the high costs associated with training these models have limited accessibility, leading to concerns about transparency, biases, and hidden agendas within AI systems. As AI becomes more integrated into governmental services and the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) advances, the necessity for transparent and reliable AI models becomes increasingly critical. Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) offers decentralized approaches to model training while safeguarding data privacy and ensuring resilience against adversarial participants. Nonetheless, the guarantees provided are not absolute, and even open-weight AI models do not qualify as truly open source. This paper suggests using blockchain technology, smart contracts, and publicly verifiable secret sharing in DFL environments to bolster trust, cooperation, and transparency in model training processes. Our numerical experiments illustrate that the overhead required to offer robust assurances to all peers regarding the correctness of the training process is relatively small. By incorporating these tools, participants can trust that trained models adhere to specified procedures, addressing accountability issues within AI systems and promoting the development of more ethical and dependable applications of AI.",10.1016/j.bcra.2024.100264,"Pavlova, Ekaterina; Melnikov, Grigorii; Yanovich, Yury; Frolov, Alexey"

Green credit policy (GCP) is considered an important financial policy tool to promote green and sustainable development, but government intervention may also bring about resource misallocation. By constructing a theoretical model of enterprise production function from the perspective of excess capacity, combined with the data of listed enterprises from 2008 to 2023 and the empirical test of the difference in difference (DID) model, this paper studies whether GCP will lead to non-green behaviors in ECIs. The results show that: (1) The GCP will cause enterprises to increase their holdings of speculative financial assets and the degree of greenwashing. (2) GCP increases financing constraints, guides financing methods from traditional credit to financial loans, and promotes capital liquidity risk and debt repayment pressure as the main channels. (3) Strengthening financial supervision and popularizing the application of blockchain technology are important measures to alleviate enterprises’ non-green behaviors. (4) The impact of GCP is more significant in the metal industry, the chemical industry, growing enterprises, and regions with low marketization degrees.

We express skepticism regarding centralized digital currencies and focus our economic analysis on private digital currencies. We specifically highlight the potential for private digital currencies to improve welfare within an emerging market with a selfish government. In that setting, we demonstrate that a private digital currency not only improves citizen welfare but also encourages local investment and enhances government welfare. The fact that a private digital currency enhances government welfare implies a permissive regulatory policy which enables citizens to realize the previously referenced welfare gains.",10.1016/j.jfs.2024.101281,"Raskin, Max; Saleh, Fahad; Yermack, David"
Blockchain-enabled cyber-physical system for construction site management: A pilot implementation,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Prefabricated construction has become one of the most innovative methods to address the pressing housing demands. However, conventional prefabricated construction projects often suffer from challenges of managing numerous paper-based documentation, non-standardized management and intricate stakeholders in construction site management (CSM). The current design approaches lack sufficient consideration of the activity-based user relationships. To facilitate the system framework design and implementation for CSM, this study proposes a generic Cyber-physical Centered (CCD) Design, illustrating an effective and systematic approach to identify user-activity relationships in a cross-collaborative context. The consideration of entity, value chain and user-activity relationships facilitate identity management and value chain management services. The proposed approach was then utilized to a pilot project to design and implement the Blockchain-enabled Cyber-physical Site Management System (BCSMS) integrated with Digital Work Supervision System (DWSS), incorporating considerations on multi-source information flow and user-centric applications design. The implemented BCSMS decentralized two types of fundamental documents in CSM - Request for Inspection and Survey Checking (RISC) form and site diary. It addresses information fragmentation and asymmetry in a cross-collaborative environment caused by manual-input and error-prone records. The proposed system was evaluated by two important system performance indicators in terms of average response time and transaction per second. The system performance test shows that the accountability of BCSMS is significant compared to DWSS, given the p-value 0.01. Blockchain effectively improves DWSS with enhanced data submission, identity management and data-driven site performance evaluation functions. This study also qualitatively analyzed the pros and cons of proposed blockchain-enabled cyber-physical system (CPS) from society-economy-technology aspects for technical practitioners, construction stakeholders and governments.",10.1016/j.aei.2023.102102,"Xiao, Jijie; Zhang, Wennan; Zhong, Ray Y."
Assessing the feasibility of blockchain technology in industries: evidence from Turkey,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8823748704801297,"Purpose The objective of this study is to assess quantitatively how feasible blockchain is for various industries, such as logistics and supply chain, health, energy, finance, automotive, pharmaceutical and agriculture and food using a comprehensive list of indicators. Design/methodology/approach A decision aid was applied to the problem of identifying the feasibility of blockchain in Turkish industries. To this end, first, a set of indicators was identified. Then, the fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS were utilized to assess the feasibility comparatively using the data gathered from a group of experts. Finally, a scenario analysis was conducted to ensure the consistency of our evaluation. Findings The findings of this study suggest that comparatively, logistics and supply chain, finance and health industries are the most feasible industries for blockchain. This study further suggests that blockchain is the least feasible for the automotive industry compared to the rest of the identified industries. Research limitations/implications It is cumbersome to find out the respondents who have sufficient knowledge of both blockchain and the identified industries. Even if we took the utmost care in identifying the right respondents, we limited our search to the biggest industrial hubs of Turkey. Practical implications The findings of this research may help various decision-makers employed in governments, conglomerates, software and consulting firms and national research institutions make more informed decisions and allocate their resources more effectively. Originality/value To this date, the current studies have solely investigated possible research opportunities in blockchain and demonstrated several blockchain applications in stand-alone cases.

Circular economy visibility evaluation framework,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8659677336930506,"Sustainability is high on the agendas of public and private organizations. Governments are setting targets for reducing the use of virgin raw materials in products and to eliminate waste. To accelerate the transition towards a Circular Economy (CE) policymakers are launching instruments. However, policy instruments, such as financial incentives or new regulatory guidelines, are prone to manipulations when the stakes for the involved stakeholders are high. Therefore, policymakers and government authorities need a solid system to monitor and control the implementation and effectiveness of their CE measures. To this end, digital technologies are key to enabling visibility and monitoring of materials flows. They allow governments and other stakeholders to use data to steer the transition towards a CE. However, data from different materials supply chains reside in a diversity of digital platforms used by a diversity of stakeholders involved. Blockchain-based platforms can support the required visibility by combining data from different stakeholders across different materials supply chains. But connecting all data for CE visibility throughout the entire materials flows into one singular platform is unlikely. With the growing number of blockchain-based platforms that each covers parts of data on CE flows, there is a need to assess the level of visibility they offer and to determine which data is lacking to monitor full CE flows. In this article, the development of a framework to evaluate blockchain-enabled information systems on their ability to act as monitoring systems for CE purposes is presented. The design science research approach was followed to develop the framework. Insights provided by academic literature as well as empirical data from three extant blockchain-enabled platforms were used (i.e., TradeLens, FoodTrust, and Vinturas). The evaluation framework can be deployed by public and private actors (e.g., governments and banks) for monitoring purposes, but also by IT providers to offer CE visibility solutions.",10.1016/j.jrt.2022.100026,"Kofos, Angelos; Ubacht, Jolien; Rukanova, Boriana; Korevaar, Gijsbert; Kouwenhoven, Norbert; Tan, Yao-Hua"
Transitioning the silk industry towards circularity: A thematic analysis of sustainable value chain practices,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8522664662456202,"The demand for natural fibers, including silk, is steadily rising, yet research on transitioning the silk industry from a traditional linear model to a circular economy still needs to grow. This study addresses this gap by outlining areas of interest to support silk companies in applying circular practices to achieve sustainability. To this end, ten semi-structured interviews with silk industry experts were carried out, and a thematic analysis was conducted, integrating findings from the extant literature to enhance the depth and contextualization of the results. Six critical themes emerged: waste utilization, circular approaches, consumer education, technology advancement, traceability and transparency, and governmental regulations. The findings reveal that production waste, such as mulberry branches, silkworm litter, low-grade cocoons, and sericin, can be repurposed into fertilizers, animal feed, cosmetics, and textiles, offering both environmental and economic benefits. Circular practices like designing for product longevity, minimizing chemical usage, reusing silk garments, and promoting recycling are key to achieving resource optimization and waste reduction. Technology advancements, including artificial intelligence and blockchain, enhance efficiency and ensure traceability and transparency, fostering stakeholder trust. Consumer education is also vital for creating awareness regarding sustainable practices. Additionally, government policies play a transformative role by supporting training programs, incentivizing innovation, and driving circularity within the industry. This study proposed a theoretical framework that offers actionable insights to industry practitioners, researchers, and policymakers for embedding circularity throughout the silk industry, contributing to global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly responsible consumption and production.

"AudiWFlow: Confidential, collusion-resistant auditing of distributed workflows",2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7649077715469871,"We discuss the problem of accountability when multiple parties cooperate towards an end result, such as multiple companies in a supply chain or departments of a government service under different authorities. In cases where a fully trusted central point does not exist, it is difficult to obtain a trusted audit trail of a workflow when each individual participant is unaccountable to all others. We propose AudiWFlow, an auditing architecture that makes participants accountable for their contributions in a distributed workflow. Our scheme provides confidentiality in most cases, collusion detection, and availability of evidence after the workflow terminates. AudiWFlow is based on verifiable secret sharing and real-time peer-to-peer verification of records; it further supports multiple levels of assurance to meet a desired trade-off between the availability of evidence and the overhead resulting from the auditing approach. We propose and evaluate two implementation approaches for AudiWFlow. The first one is fully distributed except for a central auxiliary point that, nevertheless, needs only a low level of trust. The second one is based on smart contracts running on a public blockchain, which is able to remove the need for any central point but requires integration with a blockchain.",10.1016/j.bcra.2022.100073,"Zhou, Xiaohu; Nehme, Antonio; Jesus, Vitor; Wang, Yonghao; Josephs, Mark; Mahbub, Khaled; Abdallah, Ali"
A Blockchain-based Land Title Management System for Bangladesh,2022,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,0.26045136598250157,"Bangladesh is a small country with a large population.

CBFF: A cloud–blockchain fusion framework ensuring data accountability for multi-cloud environments,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.634802789931537,"In order to develop emerging industries such as smart healthcare and intelligent transportation, the government has established various organizations and platforms to manage the growth of industries and encourage the cooperation of companies. However, as different companies’ data are scattered on different cloud platforms, it is difficult to have a unified control and reliable accountability for the operation of cloud data, which obstructs the establishment of platforms and cooperation. In this paper, to address the problems above, we propose a Cloud–Blockchain Fusion Framework (CBFF) to achieve data accountability among multiple clouds. CBFF improves the trustworthiness of operation to cloud data by designing secure mechanisms between clouds and blockchain. It designs a unified data Naming and Addressing Mechanism to publish and locate cloud data globally in a multi-cloud environment. Also, it proposes the Operation Tracing Mechanism to achieve reliable operation logging and tracing. With CBFF, we present a prototype implementation system using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and Alibaba Cloud Computing.

"Blockchain solution benefits for controlling pandemics: Bottom-up decentralization, automation with real-time update, and immutability with privacy preservation",2022,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.9231282057102526,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has created turmoil around the world. To fight this ongoing global crisis and future ones, all stakeholders must collaborate and share timely and truthful information. This paper proposes a blockchain solution based on its inherent technological advantages. We posit that benefits can be derived from three unique blockchain features: bottom-up decentralization, automation with real-time update, and immutability with privacy preservation. A decentralized common platform provides easy access and increases participation in disease surveillance, which reduces the estimation errors of the compartmental model parameters. Automation with real-time update facilitates prompt detection and diagnosis, accurate contact tracing, and targeted mitigation and containment, achieving faster recovery and slower transmission. Being immutable while preserving privacy, the blockchain solution enhances respondents’ willingness to truthfully report their contact history, avoiding false and erroneous data that will cause wrong estimates on pandemic transmission and recovery. Thus, the blockchain solution mitigates three types of risks: sample variance, delay, and bias. Through simulation, we quantify the value of the blockchain solution in these three aspects. Accordingly, we provide specific action plans based on our research findings: before building blockchain solutions for controlling COVID-19, governments and organizations can calculate the blockchain benefits and decide whether or not they should invest in such blockchain solutions by conducting a cost-benefit analysis.",10.1016/j.cie.2022.108602,"Li, Xiaoming; Liang, Huigang"
"Crossing the valley of death: Network structure, government subsidies and innovation diffusion of industrial clusters",2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8343967102544004,"To successfully cross the “valley of death” between source innovation and industrialization requires two-way efforts of technological innovation and innovative achievement transformation, which is a socialization process of innovation adoption and diffusion. Industrial clusters are the effective organizational carriers for the diffusion of innovation achievements, therefore, the research aims to explore the transformation mechanism of scientific and technological achievements in industrial clusters, especially considering the influence of network structure and government subsidies in helping industrial clusters to cross the valley of death and improve the efficiency of scientific and technological achievements transformation, so as to put forward targeted transformation countermeasures. Accordingly, a “two-stage and double-driving” innovation diffusion dynamics model was built and applied to the empirical research on China's blockchain industrial cluster by network analysis and system dynamics. It is found that government subsidies play a crucial role in the innovation adoption stage, especially for high innovative industrial clusters. In addition, there is an adoption threshold for the utility of government subsidies, and a reasonable exit mechanism should be established when adoption rates reach a certain proportion. However, for the low innovative industrial clusters, government subsidies continue to be effective. On the contrary, internal factors play a vital role in the stage of innovation diffusion, especially for industrial clusters that have developed close cooperation between upstream and downstream. This study provides the following policy implications for industrial clusters to overcome the valley of death, including carrying out classified guidance and precise implementation, appropriate subsidies and reasonable withdrawal, and improving the cultivation mechanism of “opinion leaders” enterprises.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.102119,"Yin, Yue; Yan, Ming; Zhan, Qiushi"
Toward blockchain-based renewable energy microgrid design considering default risk and demand uncertainty,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8377356013834826,"Renewable energy is a promising solution for addressing social and environmental issues related to the rapidly rising electric power consumption of manufacturers. Recently, a number of policies have been proposed by governments to stimulate the use of renewable energy by manufacturers. Financial incentives are considered as an efficient lever to increase the penetration of renewable energy. This study solves a blockchain-based renewable energy microgrid design problem, where the bank finances a loan to the power company to establish renewable generation units and the power company also offers a credit period for manufacturers to stimulate demand. Blockchain technology can be applied to mitigate default risk. The objective is to determine the number and location of renewable generation units, energy price in the time-of-use scheme, credit time to manufacturers, and blockchain implementation effort while maximizing the expected network profit. A solution method based on robust type-2 fuzzy programming was developed to solve the described problem. The application of the proposed approach was examined using an empirical case study.

Digitalised circular construction supply chain: An integrated BIM-Blockchain solution,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Blockchain and smart contracts are measures to speed up the diffusion of circular economy into construction processes. Nevertheless, integrated solutions that cover all the aspects of circular supply chain including network structure, business processes, and the products are still missing. This paper is an attempt to bridge this gap, through offering a workable solution to address the disconnected nature of blockchain adoption across construction procedures. Informed by the overall approach of design science research (DSR), the solution is created following the five-staged procedure of DSR: (1) problem identification, (2) treatment suggestion, (3) treatment design, (4) evaluation and (5) conclusion. Findings establish that the proposed solution is novel in several ways; it: (1) enables construction practitioners to share their building components information on a safe and immutable medium; (2) enables government authorities (i.e., city council) to track the treatment and delivery of hazardous products/materials; (3) supports the upstream circular economy design through fostering collaboration among ‘designers to designers’ and ‘designers to asset owners’ in a blockchain network; and (4) supports developing ‘a bank of reusable BIM families’, encouraging designers to use these items in their designs.

Privacy preserving in blockchain-based government data sharing: A Service-On-Chain (SOC) approach,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7077915174099341,"Sharing government data is of great significance to social development, but insecure and inappropriate sharing may lead to privacy breaches. Data sharing in consortium blockchain has provided a promising direction for efficient privacy preserving government data sharing. However, since government data is not owned by a single person or any government employers, it is hard to attribute participants’ responsibility for motivating data sharing behavior in blockchain systems. Furthermore, the scope and scale of government data to be shared among departments is unclear, as the purposes for retrieving shared data are dynamically changing. In order to solve these problems, we propose a Service-On-Chain (or simply, SOC) approach. The SOC approach can effectively identify different departments’ data retrieving requirements while efficiently sharing government data with trustworthiness in data content and controllability in data ownership. In particular, we utilize smart contracts to provide an onchain service to define data sharing agreements between government departments, which can identify ambiguous data retrieving requirements and formalize the process logic. We apply the SOC approach to a real world scenario and demonstrate that the SOC approach provides a feasible solution for secure and efficient sharing of data among government departments.",10.1016/j.ipm.2021.102651,"Piao, Chunhui; Hao, Yurong; Yan, Jiaqi; Jiang, Xuehong"

This has led to various attempts to apply blockchain technology (BCT) to the food cold chain, such as IBM's FoodTrust and Alibaba's Food Trust Frameworks. This system is expected to guarantee food traceability and sustainability. In this research, we focused on the importance of maritime and aviation transportation in the entire supply chain, and we established the BCT-based beef cold chain system, which includes the reefer chain. Specifically, we raised the monitoring and physical infrastructure issues at the port (or airport) and maritime (aviation) transportation node and took these into consideration. Additionally, we conducted scenario analysis to investigate the effects of the suggested system. The amount of food losses and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated by different scenarios in accordance with the recall recovery time and node where a recall occurrence is recognized. For both import and export models, when the proposed BCT-based beef cold chain platform is applied, the number of discarded reefer containers and the associated GHG emissions go down by 42.1% and 21.8%, respectively. Interestingly, when we assumed the recall recognition stage was right after the defects occur, the largest effects of improving performance of the proposed platform were 48.3% in import (IM) node of the port level.

However, when price is the only factor determining the winner, how to guarantee the trustworthiness of the auction outcomes, and at the same time preserve the privacy of losing bidders is a challenging issue. In this paper, to address this issue, we present a sealed-bid auction protocol with privacy preserving and public verifiability atop blockchain. No bidder is able to repudiate or change any bidding to outbid others and all public information comes with proof that even observers are able to validate the auction. Proofs post along the way to validate biddings and identify the winner are in the form of group elements with communication complexity O(log⁡(nm)), n,m denoting the upper bound bit length of the bidding price and the number of bidders respectively. The logarithmic complexity significantly reduces the communication cost and makes it practical for large-scale auction. Moreover, our protocol can be easily extended to any type of ordinal-price sealed-bid auction such as second-price with privacy preserving.

A survey of consensus algorithms in public blockchain systems for crypto-currencies,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.49987279131937107,"In recent years, crypto-currencies (a form of decentralised digital currencies) have been quite popular as an alternative form of payments. They are underpinned by a breakthrough technology called Blockchain which extensively use a number of cryptographic mechanisms and other advanced techniques from the domain of distributed computing. This blockchain technology has received unparalleled attention from academia, industry, and governments worldwide and is considered to have the potential to disrupt several application domains, other than currencies, touching all spheres of our lives. The sky-rocket anticipation of its potential has caused a wide-scale exploration of its usage in different application domains. This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various purposes. However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious shortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be addressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component of any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which determines its performance and security in many ways. Therefore, to address the limitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel consensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these algorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain performs the way it functions. Towards this aim, there are a number of existing works that have surveyed and reviewed a number of consensus algorithms. However, all these works have some major shortcomings. For example, the factors upon which the consensus algorithms have been analysed are not comprehensive. Importantly, a wide range of consensus algorithms utilised in public blockchain systems supporting mainly crypto-currencies have different variants. Such variants and their internal mechanisms utilised in many existing crypto-currencies have not been considered at all. This article fills these gaps by analysing a wide range of consensus algorithms leveraged in different public blockchain systems using a comprehensive taxonomy of properties. We have also analysed more than a hundred top crypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus algorithms to understand their properties and implicate different trends in these crypto-currencies.

Therefore, streamlining this process is vital to improve efficiency and save more lives. Because of its effective data sharing mechanism among different entities with a number of security features, blockchain can be an effective tool for different applications in the health sector. Furthermore, blockchain provides a distributed system along with greater privacy, transparency, and authenticity. In this article, we have presented a blockchain-based system that seamlessly integrates testing and vaccination systems, allowing the system to be transparent. The instant verification of any tamper-proof COVID-19 test result has been developed, which will serve as “Test Certificates”. A transparent and efficient vaccination system has also been exhibited and implemented as the “Digital Vaccine Passport” (DVP) system. The infection rate-based prioritization will ensure a transparent and fair vaccination process as well as tackle the distribution issue of the limited amount of vaccine. The comparative review with other existing works is also discussed, highlighting a clear difference from the existing works. Our proposed system is distinctive on the basis of prioritization of vaccines and seamless integration of test certificates and vaccine passports, which will aid in controlling the pandemic situation. This system will also be handy in the case of tackling any future pandemics initially.",10.1016/j.bcra.2022.100092,"Nabil, Shirajus Salekin; Alam Pran, Md Sabbir; Al Haque, Ali Abrar; Chakraborty, Narayan Ranjan; Chowdhury, Mohammad Jabed Morshed; Ferdous, Md Sadek"
Blockchain government - a next form of infrastructure for the twenty-first century,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Today, more than 100 blockchain projects created to transform government systems are being conducted in more than 30 countries. What leads countries rapidly initiate blockchain projects? I argue that it is because blockchain is a technology directly related to social organization; Unlike other technologies, a consensus mechanism form the core of blockchain. Traditionally, consensus is not the domain of machines but rather humankind. However, blockchain operates through a consensus algorithm with human intervention; once that consensus is made, it cannot be modified or forged. Through utilization of Lawrence Lessig’s proposition that “Code is law,” I suggest that blockchain creates “absolute law” that cannot be violated. This characteristic of blockchain makes it possible to implement social technology that can replace existing social apparatuses including bureaucracy. In addition, there are three close similarities between blockchain and bureaucracy. First, both of them are defined by the rules and execute predetermined rules. Second, both of them work as information processing machines for society. Third, both of them work as trust machines for society. Therefore, I posit that it is possible and moreover unavoidable to replace bureaucracy with blockchain systems. In conclusion, I suggest five principles that should be adhered to when we replace bureaucracy with the blockchain system: 1) introducing Blockchain Statute law; 2) transparent disclosure of data and source code; 3) implementing autonomous executing administration; 4) building a governance system based on direct democracy and 5) making Distributed Autonomous Government(DAG).",10.1186/s40852-018-0086-3,"Jun, MyungSan"
Energy consumption by cryptocurrency: A bibliometric analysis revealing research trends and insights,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7313037960868709,"Cryptocurrency is rapidly emerging as a prominent player in the global financial system, characterized by its decentralized nature and the absence of centralized government oversight. However, this autonomy raises significant environmental concerns primarily stemming from the energy-intensive mining process. Crypto mining, central to the creation of new coins and transaction validation, results in substantial carbon emissions and energy consumption. This study employs bibliometric analysis using RStudio to scrutinize the data sourced from the Scopus database. Data selection adhered to specific inclusion criteria, focusing on research articles and documents in the English language. Exclusion criteria targeted the elimination of review papers, conference reviews, short surveys, notes, and articles in languages other than English. China emerges as the foremost contributor with a frequency of 348 and a total citation count of 1259, followed by the USA with 594 citations. Notably, the keywords ""blockchain"" and ""bitcoin"" surface most frequently, occurring 293 and 148 times, respectively. The study posits that China's decision to ban cryptocurrency due to economic concerns has likely contributed to heightened global awareness of cryptocurrencies. In contrast, the USA has actively embraced cryptocurrencies, fostering their widespread circulation. Consequently, these two countries have emerged as leading contributors to energy consumption in the cryptocurrency sector. Blockchain, originally a broad concept, has found applications in diverse domains such as marketing, finance, healthcare, supply chain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This widespread adoption has expanded the scope of energy consumption considerations from cryptocurrencies to encompass blockchain technology as a whole. Future research should focus on mining regulation, alternative mechanisms, renewable energy sources, technological advancements, and carbon offsetting solutions. The article also addresses its limitations and the future scope of the study in detail.",10.1016/j.nexus.2024.100274,"Anandhabalaji, V.; Babu, Manivannan; Brintha, R."
Investigating the influence of organizational factors on blockchain adoption,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Purpose Blockchain possesses the potential to disrupt and reshape a plethora of industries in the next decade. However, blockchain adoption rates in technology developed countries, such as Ireland, are relatively low. Motivated by blockchain’s potential to transform sociotechnical systems, the lack of systematic inquiry pertaining to blockchain studies from an information system perspective, the authors propose the following research question: “How do organizational factors influence blockchain adoption in organizations based in a developed country?” Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to elucidate the impact of organizational factors on the adoption of blockchain and the adoption of blockchain in companies based in Ireland. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review was conducted, and the methods of qualitative content analysis were used to identify the most important technology–organization–environment (TOE) blockchain adoption factors. Organizational factors are often viewed as the most significant determinants of IT innovation adoption in organizations. Consequently, using a multiple-case study of 20 companies based in Ireland, the authors investigate how the top three organizational factors identified from the blockchain literature affected these companies decision to adopt or not adopt blockchain. Findings The literature review on blockchain adoption identified specific technological, organizational and environmental factors. Furthermore, the case study findings identified three patterns: top management support and organizational readiness are enablers for blockchain adoption, and large companies are more likely to adopt blockchain than small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors explain these patterns by examining the nature of blockchain and the characteristics of Ireland as a developed country. Practical and scientific contributions are also presented. Research limitations/implications This study makes several important scientific contributions. First, the findings revealed that top management support and organizational readiness are significant enablers of blockchain adoption. Ireland is recognized as a technology developed country; however, the findings in relation to top management support contradict existing IT adoption literature pertaining to developed countries. Second, previous IT innovation adoption literature suggests that organizations size has a positive influence on a company’s IT innovation adoption process. This study demonstrates that large organizations are more likely to not only adopt blockchain but are also more likely to conduct increased levels of blockchain research and development activities. Finally, and most significantly, the authors identified several patterns, which relate specifically to Ireland as a developed country that influenced the findings. These findings could hold particular relevance to governments and organizations of other developed countries in terms of accelerating blockchain adoption. Practical implications The findings about the low level of blockchain awareness and the lack of information pertaining to viable business use cases indicate that the Irish government could play a more significant role in promoting the benefits of blockchain technologies. Further, the findings could also encourage IT providers to formulate enhanced strategies aimed at disseminating information pertaining to blockchain technologies. Second, the positive influence of top management support and organizational readiness, particularly about core competencies, on blockchain adoption suggests that equipping managers with the requisite knowledge and skills will be crucial in adopting these IT innovations. Finally, organizations who adopted blockchain used cloud-based blockchain platforms and tools to overcome the constraints of their initial low levels of organizational readiness. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to identify specific TOE blockchain adoption factors. Further, the authors examine how the three most identified organizational adoption factors impact organizations decisions to adopt blockchain. Finally, the authors discuss how the resulting three patterns identified by examining the nature of blockchain and the characteristics of Ireland as a technology developed country.",10.1108/IMDS-08-2018-0365,"Clohessy, Trevor; Acton, Thomas"
Optimization and evolution of UAV insurance provision framework: Insights into multi-sector cooperation,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.505352025471225,"The rapid expansion of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents considerable challenges in risk management. Although insurance is essential for mitigating the risks associated with UAV operations, aviation insurers face major obstacles in providing effective coverage due to insufficient actuarial data, limited expertise, and regulatory uncertainties. This study aims to optimize the UAV insurance provision framework to help address the issue of inefficient coverage. Through a comparative analysis of traditional and cooperative UAV insurance provision frameworks, the study identifies multi-sector cooperation as the most effective approach. This framework involves close cooperation among aviation insurers, the government, and UAV manufacturers. To examine the stability of this framework, an evolutionary game theory model is developed, with aviation insurers and the government as the main players. Factors such as cooperative profits, cooperative costs, and the benefits of free-riding are identified as pivotal to the framework's stability. The system's sensitivity to variations in these factors is demonstrated through simulations. The study also outlines a potential evolutionary path for the UAV insurance provision framework, emphasizing a phased approach that adapts to the evolving UAV landscape. This research offers valuable insights into optimizing UAV insurance provision and provides practical guidance for aviation insurers, policymakers, and UAV manufacturers in fostering cooperative strategies that enhance the overall safety and sustainability of UAV operations.",10.1016/j.jairtraman.2025.102740,"Ma, Qian"
A highly credible and efficient real-time carbon MRV + O system for delicacy management of distributed carbon abatement behaviors,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.915427218935914,"The current monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) and offset (O) systems usually require at least one or two months, which is time-consuming. We proposed a highly efficient real-time MRV + O mechanism based on Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology. This mechanism includes the accounting model for a certain distributed carbon reduction scenario, real-time M system, real-time RV system, and real-time O system, enabling individuals to reliably declare their distributed carbon abatement behaviors in real-time. We modified the existing calculating methodology for carbon reduction published by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and included factors such as air conditioning systems etc., in the selected distributed carbon reduction scenario named battery electric vehicles (BEVs)/hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) driving. In our case study in Shanghai, we analyzed the hourly carbon dioxide emissions reductions based on approximately 20,000 driving records of four different kinds of BEVs/HEVs using our real-time MRV + O framework to verify the effectiveness of our system. We found that the proposed system can achieve hourly analysis and avoid falsified values; BEVs and HEVs could reduce greenhouse emissions by 64.54% and 46.42%, respectively. As public engagement is essential to achieve carbon neutralization in a country, this system can accelerate the sustainable transformation by delicacy management of distributed carbon abatement behaviors.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.122265,"Li, Qingqing; Shi, Jinbo; Ni, Kan; Wang, Ruohan; Zhang, Chongyi; Yang, Nan; Yang, Yifei; Shen, Yifan; Guo, Ru; Liao, Zhenliang"
Capitalism after Satoshi,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the long-run economic structure and economic policy consequences of wide-spread blockchain adoption. Design/methodology/approach The approach uses institutional, organisational and evolutionary economic theory to predict consequences of blockchain innovation for economic structure (dehierarchicalisation) and then to further predict the effect of that structural change on the demand for economic policy. Findings The paper makes two key predictions. First, that blockchain adoption will cause both market disintermediation and organisational dehierarchicalisation. And second, that these structural changes will unwind some of the rationale for economic policy developed through the twentieth century that sought to control the effects of market power and organisational hierarchy. Research limitations/implications The core implication that the theoretical prediction made in this paper is that wide-spread blockchain technology adoption could reduce the need for counter-veiling economic policy, and therefore limiting the role of government. Originality/value The paper takes a standard prediction made about blockchain adoption, namely disintermediation (or growth of markets), and extends it to point out that the same effect will occur to organisations. It then notes that much of the rationale for economic policy, and especially industry and regulatory policy through the twentieth century was justified in order to control economic power created by hierarchical organisations. The surprising implication, then, is that blockchain adoption weakens the rationale for such economic policy. This reveals the long-run relationship between digital technological innovation and the regulatory state.",10.1108/JEPP-03-2019-0012,"Berg, Chris; Davidson, Sinclair; Potts, Jason"
Behavior analysis of photovoltaic-storage-use value chain game evolution in blockchain environment,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8585396266809948,"In view of the stability of photovoltaic utilization and trust in transactions, this paper constructed a photovoltaic-storage-use value chain in the block chain environment, and studied the behavioral strategies of photovoltaic power generators, energy storage providers and users in the value chain by using a three-party evolutionary game model. This paper analyzes the influence of the initial willingness of game players, the cost and utilization degree of blockchain technology, government subsidies, the price reduction coefficient of users, and the loss of photovoltaic-storage being wholesaled on the results of evolutionary equilibrium. The results show the cooperation between photovoltaic power generators and energy storage providers will become one of the trends of photovoltaic development in the future, and users will greatly enhance the utilization degree of photovoltaic and realize the value co-creation of the three parties. The decrease of blockchain technology cost, the increase of blockchain utilization, the increase of government subsidies, the increase of user price reduction coefficient, the decrease of photovoltaic-storage loss coefficient of being wholesaled and so on encourage the increase of cooperation of photovoltaic power generators and energy storage providers, and users' behavior of using photovoltaic.

Accepting financial transactions using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency: A customer perspective approach,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Blockchain, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, are innovative FinTech technologies that speedily invade the finance market and changing the power of the global economy. However, there was a low acceptance of these technologies among consumers. There is a clear gap in-between that has not yet been taken into consideration and has been misunderstood on many platforms. This paper intends to estimate the usability of blockchain technology by investigating behavioral elements that affect customers' intention towards blockchain-based cryptocurrency transactions. Given the complexity of the technology, this study proposes a new integration model: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) together with new external variables regarding blockchain adoption characteristics such as trust, regulatory support, social influence, design, and experience. Surveys were conducted among international users to identify the impacts of these variables on their intention. Our findings indicate two powerful constructs (regulatory support and experience) that encourage customer trust towards blockchain-based applications. People surveyed agreed on a great sense of security and can trust the Blockchain-based applications when they are regulated and insured by the local government. Also, at a certain level of experience, users feel confident to use blockchain-based applications, a high level of trust supports technology adoption. As such, governments and businesses can dedicate efforts to enhance customers' trust and ultimately promote better acceptance of blockchain technology and its applications.",10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101320,"Albayati, Hayder; Kim, Suk Kyoung; Rho, Jae Jeung"
Improving the Financial Security of National Health Insurance using Cloud-Based Blockchain Technology Application,2022,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.9030646489316513,"Since Bitcoin's success, there has been a greater emphasis on researching the use of blockchain in a wide range of applications, such as agriculture, education, government, voting systems, etc. This generation of Blockchain applications is termed blockchain 3.0. Blockchain technology provides enhanced security, auditability, privacy, accountability, and many more features over a centralized system. Fraud in insurance is an international problem affecting all insurance subdomains in both developed and developing countries. Fraud, corruption, and many other data-related problems are threatening the financial security of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana and if not attended to, the core aims of the scheme to provide universal healthcare services will not be realized.

Consumers’ Intentions to Adopt Blockchain-Based Personal Health Records and Data Sharing: Focus Group Study,2020,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.9630997524994588,"Background Although researchers are giving increased attention to blockchain-based personal health records (PHRs) and data sharing, the majority of research focuses on technical design. Very little is known about health care consumers’ intentions to adopt the applications. Objective This study aims to explore the intentions and concerns of health care consumers regarding the adoption of blockchain-based personal health records and data sharing. Methods Three focus groups were conducted, in which 26 participants were shown a prototype of a user interface for a self-sovereign blockchain-based PHR system (ie, a system in which the individual owns, has custody of, and controls access to their personal health information) to be used for privacy and secure health data sharing. A microinterlocutor analysis of focus group transcriptions was performed to show a descriptive overview of participant responses. NVivo 12.0 was used to code the categories of the responses. Results Participants did not exhibit a substantial increase in their willingness to become owners of health data and share the data with third parties after the blockchain solution was introduced. Participants were concerned about the risks of losing private keys, the resulting difficulty in accessing care, and the irrevocability of data access on blockchain. They did, however, favor a blockchain-based PHR that incorporates a private key recovery system and offers a health wallet hosted by government or other positively perceived organizations. They were more inclined to share data via blockchain if the third party used the data for collective good and offered participants nonmonetary forms of compensation and if the access could be revoked from the third party. Conclusions Health care consumers were not strongly inclined to adopt blockchain-based PHRs and health data sharing. However, their intentions may increase when the concerns and recommendations demonstrated in this study are considered in application design.",10.2196/21995,"Lu, Chang; Batista, Danielle; Hamouda, Hoda; Lemieux, Victoria"
Impacts of blockchain-based digital transition on cold supply chains with a third-party logistics service provider,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Blockchain is a driver for digitalization in the fresh industry, but the resulting improvements in each supply chain member’s performance are difficult to predict. In this study, we examine the effects of blockchain-based digital transition in a cold supply chain with a manufacturer, a retailer, and a third-party logistics service provider (3PL). Our study provides several managerial implications. First, blockchain adoption would lead to a preservation service level increase if the 3PL charges a low transportation fee, but a preservation service level decrease if the 3PL charges a high one. Second, the blockchain adoption may induce the manufacturer to increase its wholesale price, which does not cause the retailer to cut the order quantity but instead sets a lager one. Third, our results indicate that simply relying on the market mechanism may not enable the cold supply chain to make the optimal decision; thus, government intervention or an exogenous coordination mechanism must be introduced to drive the cold supply chain members to reach a consensus on blockchain-based digital transition. Finally, the main results in the basic model are proven to remain robust. Managerial implications are discussed and provided.",10.1016/j.tre.2023.103014,"Zhang, Xuefeng; Li, Zhe; Li, Guo"
Emission trading innovation mechanism based on blockchain,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8632082174527935,"The rationality and scientific nature of the emission trading mechanism is the key to the effective implementation of environmental and economic policies. As far as China is concerned, there are phenomena such as information asymmetry, low supervision efficiency, and alienation of government and enterprise behaviors caused by the incomplete mechanism of emission trading in the practice of different pilots. The introduction of blockchain technology can innovate the traditional transaction model and form a decentralized peer-to-peer transaction and a trusted emission trading market. To this end, based on the current emission trading mechanism and the characteristics of blockchain technology, this paper couples the core technologies of blockchain with the functional requirements of application scenarios. Then, an innovative application framework is built based on the consortium blockchain Fabric from three aspects: emission trading supervision, secondary trading market construction, as well as emission trading incentive and punishment mechanisms. Technologies such as the consensus mechanism, smart contract, Merkle tree and asymmetric encryption are comprehensively applied in this process. In the construction of the blockchain framework of the secondary market for emission trading, institutional changes and innovations brought about by the blockchain at various levels are analyzed in terms of participants, transaction processes and the transaction scope. At the same time, smart contract functions and algorithms are designed for the purchase, transfer-out and trading of emission rights, and the operation business logic of the smart contract is analyzed. On the whole, this paper explores the application framework of blockchain technology in the field of emission trading at the macro level, and analyzes the application mechanism of the corresponding technologies of blockchain at each coupling point in the framework at the micro level. The collaborative analysis at the two levels shows that blockchain technology and the requirements of emission trading mechanism can be effectively coupled, and the application of blockchain technology can promote the effective supervision of enterprises' emission behavior, making the processes of the purchase, transfer and transaction of emission rights intelligent and automated, and providing technical support for cross-regional emission trading to reduce transaction costs and management complexity. In addition, the issuance of emission credits based on smart contract will be a new incentive for companies to actively participate in transactions. Based on the above analysis, this paper believes that the innovative application of blockchain technology is of great significance in the promotion of the market-based allocation of element of emission trading and the rational allocation of environmental resources. It will lead to a major breakthrough in the traditional trading system in terms of trading modes, forming a value transmission network of environmental resources between the government and polluters.",10.1016/j.cjpre.2022.01.010,"Zhao, Nan; Sheng, Zhaohan; Yan, Hao"

Driven by this, Electric vehicles (EV) have been strongly advocated by the government for their zero-emission merit. However, the promotion of EV is not smoothly caused by inconvenient charging issues. For the high construction cost and land scarcity, current public charging stations could not meet the booming charging demands and worry the potential EV users. To address the problem, this paper proposed a peer-to-peer (P2P) private charging pile sharing system supported by blockchain technology. In this system, the charging records of EV users could be packaged and uploaded into the blockchain, which is immutable and tamper-resistant. The detailed blockchain hierarchy is also designed to make this system more practical. Meanwhile, the Multi-Agent-Based (MAB) model is adopted to evaluate the performance of this sharing system.

Design and implementation of a New Blockchain-based digital health passport: A Moroccan case study,2022,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.7423711518846082,"In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, the Moroccan Interior and Health Ministries have proposed to use the health pass with a QR code to identify vaccinated people. Additionally, the government suggested a mobile application to control the health passport authenticity. However, the key problem is the possibility of anyone scanning the QR code and figuring out citizens' private information, causing severe issues about individual privacy. In this work, the main contribution is integrating a private Blockchain-based digital health passport to ensure high protection of sensitive information, security and privacy among all the actors (Government, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Health, verifiers) that comply with the CNDP (National Commission for the Control of Personal Data Protection) and the Moroccan Law 09–08. In our proposed architectural framework solution, we identify two types of actors: authorized and unauthorized, to limit and control access to the citizens' personal information. Besides, to preserve individuals' privacy, we adopt on-chain and off-chain storage (Interplanetary File Systems IPFS). In our case, smart contracts improve security and privacy in the health passport verification process. Our system implementation describes the proposed solution to grant individual privacy.

A blockchain-based framework for on-site construction environmental monitoring: Proof of concept,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"On-site construction environmental monitoring (OCEM) can help to govern the behaviors of construction stakeholders in terms of pollutant emissions and environmental protection. Current OCEM systems, nevertheless, were built utilizing a centralized architecture, such as the government's local database, which leads to information imbalance and disputes among multiple stakeholders. When there are no trustworthy data records to justify construction companies' compliance, for example, arguments or even conflicts may emerge between neighboring residents and the contractors. Blockchain has the potential to be a reliable platform for environmental monitoring due to its decentralization, immutability, transparency, and autonomous enforcement of agreements. However, there has been limited investigation into the blockchain's possibilities in OCEM. Aiming to bridge the knowledge gap, this paper proposed a blockchain-enabled framework for OCEM. To begin, an overall conceptual framework was created, in which construction pollutant data was collected via sensors and then uploaded to the blockchain network. Then, based on the consensus algorithm, the on-chained information flow was introduced. Smart contracts were programmed to automatically monitor the level of construction pollutants and evaluate environmental performance. Finally, a case study was carried out to validate the theoretical viability of the proposed framework in a laboratory environment, in which a blockchain prototype based on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture was presented. The results indicate that blockchain can assist OCEM by supplying trustworthy environmental data and allowing for continuous monitoring.

Assessing engagement decisions in NFT Metaverse based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB),2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7763467044017928,"Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have reached enormous levels of interest all over the world; The attraction was huge besides buying or creating an NFT. However, the actual use requires consideration of many aspects and sources to make decisions and engage in the NFT market. Moving forward and selecting what to create or where to buy, it is necessary to assess the NFT and whether it is worth investing in or not. On the other hand, Metaverse has become a trending topic and market interest has increased dramatically. However, NFT is crucial to enable the Metaverse; NFT approved its essential to the success of Metaverse adoption. In conclusion, this choice is complicated, especially when it involves extensive knowledge and information from different sources and perspectives (Engineering and Social Science). Some aspects are related to the customer experience and trust, and others are more likely to be asset-related. As we look at the blockchain market, we distinguish a variety of platforms and applications that can be used conveniently, presenting numerous options and possibilities. That brings to mind some ideas and asks some questions to assist the engagement in the NFT metaverse; When is the best moment to engage in the NFT metaverse? Is trading or engaging in the NFT metaverse trustworthy? Is it legal to use and trade NFTs, is there any need for governments to get involved? What NFT piece should create or what price to buy? What is the best and most secure platform to use? Assessing the NFTs requires deep research into different sources of controversial information and data. However, no such reference or study covers these considerations in detail; the lack of trusted resources and knowledge impacts the user experience and engagement. This paper contributes to social science studies by performing a multi-factor (comprehensive) analysis that includes the NFT Metaverse engagement decision and user behavior. We are using an extended model of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), proposing a model which includes external factors to help identify the variables that influence the engagement with NFTs in the metaverse. This comprehensive study has a multi-perspective approach; customer perspective, social perspective, technology perspective, legal perspective, and market perspective. We present extensive knowledge and information to be a helpful piece of awareness for everyone who intends to buy, invest, or create an NFT. This study uses a quantitative analysis method and provides meaningful results explaining this dilemma and the reasons behind the massive adoption of NFT and its fluctuation worldwide.

Evaluating the carbon emission reduction in construction and demolition waste management in China,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9045219303303823,"Construction and demolition waste reduction (C&DWR) is an important measure to protect the environment and promote sustainable development in the construction sector. The present policy in China remains a lack of emphasis on carbon tax and penalty for reducing construction waste. This paper proposes a construction and demolition waste (C&DW) management model to identify the waste reduction effects of various policies in China. It simulates the effects of single policies and combined policies on waste reduction and carbon emission by using the approach of integrating system dynamics and grey model theory. The results reveal that: (1) Penalties can effectively reduce the amount of illegal dump waste and carbon emissions from illegal dump waste, with an appropriate penalty value (in Chinese CNY) suggested as ∈160,320. (2) Subsidies can vastly increase the amount of waste recycled and a carbon tax can reduce carbon emissions; the recommended values are suggested as subsidies ∈30,45 and carbon tax ∈40,70. (3) Compared to other policies, the combined policy of penalty–waste disposal charging fee–subsidy–carbon tax (160, 60, 45, 70) achieves the greatest environmental benefits in terms of reducing waste and carbon emission. (4) Governments should improve waste minimization incentive policies and gradually introduce trials for a carbon tax policy, encourage the use of digital governance combined with blockchain technology to regulate C&DW. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers to develop effective waste reduction strategies and promote sustainability through the implementation of C&DWR theories.",10.1016/j.enbuild.2024.114932,"Yi, Yanqing; Liu, Jingkuang; Cristina Lavagnolo, Maria; Manzardo, Alessandro"
Digital transformation and carbon emission reduction: The moderating effect of external pressure and support,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"As an important path to promote the integration of the digital economy and the real economy, digital transformation (DT) can not only help industrial enterprises achieve high-quality economic development, but also promote the green and low-carbon transformation. This paper uses industrial enterprises in China's A-share listed enterprises from 2012 to 2021 as research samples to explores the impact of DT on carbon emission reduction (CEMR). The study finds that: (1) DT can significantly promote CEMR, which is still established after various robustness and endogeneity tests. (2) The mechanism test show that information effect, governance effect, resource effect, and technology effect are all significant mechanisms underlying the overall effect of DT on CEMR. (3) The moderating effect test of external pressure and support show that in enterprises with stronger external pressure such as high environmental regulations and high market competition, and enterprises with more external support such as high credit lines and high government subsidies, DT has a greater positive effect on promoting CEMR. (4) The heterogeneity analysis of the internal characteristics of enterprises shows that the positive effect of DT on promoting CEMR is stronger in SOEs and enterprises in carbon-intensive industries. (5) The heterogeneity analysis of external institutional environment shows that the positive effect of DT on promoting CEMR is stronger in enterprises with poor marketization level and legal environment. (6) The heterogeneity analysis of different dimensions of DT shows that artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud-computing, big data and digital technology application can significantly promote CEMR, but there are certain differences in the impact effect. This paper adds important nuance to our understanding of the relationship between DT and CEMR at the enterprise level, allowing for development of better targeted policy in support of low-carbon economic development in China.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.145108,"Han, Shaozhen; Zhang, Hanshi; Li, Hui; Xun, Zhou"

Fortifying Uzbekistan's integrity landscape: Harnessing India's tech-driven anti-corruption strategies,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.839013190617338,"Corruption poses significant challenges to sustainable development and social justice in Uzbekistan. This paper explores how Uzbekistan can strengthen its anti-corruption framework by leveraging emerging technologies and drawing lessons from India's experience in using information and communication technology (ICT) to combat corruption. The study employs a qualitative research methodology, analysing data from government reports, case studies, and expert interviews to identify specific areas where Uzbekistan can learn from India's successes and challenges in applying ICT solutions. The findings highlight several key ways ICT can bolster anti-corruption efforts in Uzbekistan, such as increasing transparency through e-governance platforms, improving accountability via digital monitoring systems, and enabling citizen participation with online reporting tools. The paper provides concrete examples and data from India demonstrating how technologies like biometrics, blockchain, and data analytics have helped detect fraud, streamline bureaucratic processes, and empower citizens to report corruption. However, the research also reveals critical legal, institutional and cultural barriers Uzbekistan must address to effectively implement these tech-based approaches, such as outdated regulations, lack of technical expertise, and public distrust. Comparing India and Uzbekistan's contexts, the paper offers tailored recommendations for how Uzbekistan can adapt India's ICT models to overcome its unique constraints. The study concludes that while technology is not a panacea, strategically integrating ICT into Uzbekistan's anti-corruption arsenal – with insights from India's experience – can be a powerful tool to promote good governance, curb corruption, and ultimately advance social justice for citizens.

Integrated techno-economic and life cycle assessment of shared circular business model based blockchain-enabled dynamic grapevoltaic farm for major grape growing states in India,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8149404715370858,"Grape farms face many climate risks during cultivation, and regulatory and sustainability-related challenges after the harvest. To support the farmers, Government of India (GoI) aims to promote adaptive capacity throughout the grape value chain by improving resilient infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel Grapevoltaics farm design based on shared circular business model principles where resources like energy, water, and land are shared between grape farmer and solar plant operator. The resilience (in the near term) and sustainability (in the long term) of such multifunctional systems may be influenced by the decisions taken by the involved stakeholders in terms of resource sharing and support extension when facing climate risk events. To address stakeholder engagement, the proposed Grapevoltaic farms leverage blockchain smart contract, making them Blockchain-enabled Grapevoltaics (BCeDGVs). To understand the feasibility, 1-ha Grapevoltaic farm is modeled for 12 grape growing regions accross India and analysed using Resilience Performance, Life Cycle Analysis, and Techno-Economic (RePLiCATE) approach. The results show that the solar panels provide resilience support based on the rules of engagement written on blockchain smart contracts. The BCeDGVs has 1295.28–2908.08 kWh/kWp/day electricity generation potential across India with a lifetime average of 15,380.65 MWh even after considering the national average photovoltaic degradation rate of 1.9%. The observed grape yields vary between 2 and 31.25 Mt/ha with an average yield of 45 Mt/ha (table grape) and 40 Mt/ha (wine grape), and the rainwater harvest varies between 1.23 to 7.32 Ml. The economic assessment revealed that grape farmers and photovoltaic plant operators across India under BCeDGVs could have revenues ranging between INR 56.25 to 225 million and INR 29.48–66.19 million, respectively, suggesting to relook into the feed-in tariffs and crop selling prices. The environmental sustainability results suggest that 1.984 ha/MW land-use mitigation and 12–100% reduction in groundwater dependency are possible while maintaining the minimum and maximum national average global warming potentials as 0.074 and 0.088 kg CO2-eq./kg grape, respectively. Overall, the integrated assessments find that the BCeDGVs may promote low carbon, climate resilient grape cultivation in India and has possible integration with GoI's GrapeNet platform.

Some risks of tokenization and blockchainizaition of private law,2018,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.69670467552692,"The paper focuses on the analysis of the problems that may be driven by mass tokenization of the objects of civil law, i.e. the creation of a digital representation of such objects in the form of a record in blockchain. This occurs where the value of such objects is transferred subsequently by means of disposal of such tokens, which is a subject of separate rights to it. The paper outlines two core problems, which were inspired by recent legislative activities in Belarus and Russia. The first is a possible displacement of existing legal regimes of objects of civil rights by the legal regime of the token. Secondly, the problem of definition of the nature of rights to tokens arises (in rem versus ad personam) as well as remedies for their violations. Provisions of the Belarus Decree “On the development of digital economy” of 21 December 2017 and drafts of the laws on blockchain and ICO, discussed in Russian Parliament and Government are taken to illustrate these problems.",10.1016/j.clsr.2018.05.010,"Savelyev, Alexander"

Several blockchain-based big data trading methods have been proposed; however, they do not adequately address the security issues introduced by dishonesty in the data provider and data agent or the fairness of data revenue distribution and price bargaining. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized data trading system in which data trading is completed by smart contract-based data matching, price negotiation, and reward assigning. Moreover, the proposed data trading system evaluates the data quality on the basis of three metrics, records the evaluation results in a side-chain, and distributes the data users’ application revenue to the data provider according to the evaluated data quality.

"Strategic Guidance and Technological Solutions for Human Resources Management to Sustain an Aging Workforce: Review of International Standards, Research, and Use Cases",2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8002733121382561,"Background New technologies offer opportunities to create a healthy, productive, and capable aging workforce. There is little research from an organizational perspective about how technology can help create a sustainable aging workforce. Objective This study aims to (1) explore how technological solutions in organizations can help create and maintain a healthy, productive, and capable aging workforce; and (2) provide recommendations and strategic guidance that benefit both the aging worker and the organization. Methods International standardization practices, ethical frameworks, collaborative research, and use cases are used to demonstrate how technological solutions can be translated into practice and formed the basis for the development of a set of recommendations to create and maintain a sustainable aging workforce. Results Organizations need to look at aging through different lenses to optimize an age-inclusive workforce rather than viewing it by chronological age alone. International standards in technology, human resources management, and aging societies can form part of the solution to improve aging workforces. Digitalization of workplaces, digital literacy, innovation, intergenerational collaboration, and knowledge management form important elements of the international standard on age-inclusive workforce. Using internationally agreed ethical frameworks that consider age bias when designing artificial intelligence–related products and services can help organizations in their approach. Age bias in artificial intelligence development in the workplace can be avoided through inclusive practices. No blockchain application was found yet to improve the aging workforce. Barriers to blockchain adoption include fear of layoffs, worker resistance and lack of blockchain competence, worldwide adoption, support, and funding. Integrating blockchain into the internet of things may allow for improved efficiencies, reduce cost, and resolve workforce capacity problems. Organizations could benefit from implementing or funding wearable technologies for their workers. Recent tools such as the Ageing@Work toolkit consisting of virtual user models and virtual workplace models allow for the adaptation of the work processes and the ergonomics of workplaces to the evolving needs of aging workers. Lastly, selected use cases that may contribute to sustaining an aging workforce are explored (eg, the Exposure-Documentation-System, wireless biomedical sensors, and digital voice notes). Conclusions The synergy of international standardization and ethical framework tools with research can advance information and communication technology solutions in improving aging workforces. There appears to be a momentum that technological solutions to achieve an age-inclusive workforce will undoubtedly find a stronger place within the global context and is most likely to have increased acceptance of technological applications among aging workers as well as organizations and governments. International standardization, cross-country research, and learning from use cases play an important role to ensure practical, efficient, and ethical implementation of technological solutions to contribute to a sustainable aging workforce.",10.2196/27250,"Wissemann, Ann Kathrin; Pit, Sabrina Winona; Serafin, Patrick; Gebhardt, Hansjürgen"

Traceability system (TS) is designed to assure safe and good quality food, while reducing the costs of food recalls. It should encompass all stakeholders, including governments, companies, and consumers, each of whom has an important role in the implementation and guardianship of such systems. The EU and China are amongst the main players implementing TS and are constantly exploring new opportunities and monitoring challenges for TS in a time of shifting consumer demands and rapid new technology innovation. Scope and approach This article states development stages from TS 1.0 to 3.0. and reviews TS development in a number of key countries and regions. Comparisons between the EU and China are drawn in terms of government, corporate, and consumer involvement in traceability. Key findings and conclusions A functional TS, while providing bi-directional communication between trading partners, must meet the laws and regulations where it operates. A functional system must also consider consumer value and perception, which varies with geography.

Skin lands in Ghana and application of blockchain technology for acquisition and title registration,2020,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,0.7095976066093004,"Purpose The land sector in Ghana, particularly skin lands acquisition and title registration are fraught with several issues including unreliable record-keeping systems and land encroachments. The paper explores the potential of blockchain application in skin lands acquisition and title registration in Ghana with the aim of developing a blockchain-enabled framework for land acquisition. The purpose of this paper is to use the framework as a tool towards solving some of the loopholes in the process that leads to numerous issues bedeviling the current system. Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts a systematic literature review approach fused with informal discussions with key informants and leverages on the researchers’ own experiences to conceptualize blockchain application in skin lands acquisition in Ghana. Findings Problems bedeviling skin lands acquisition and title registration emanated from the issuance of allocation notes, payment of kola money and use of a physical ledger to document land transactions. As a result, the developed framework was designed to respond to these issues and deal with the problems. As the proposed blockchain framework would be a public register, it was argued that information on all transactions on a specific parcel of land could be available to the public in real-time. This enhances transparency and possibly resolves the issue of encroachments and indeterminate land boundaries because stakeholders can determine rightful owners of land parcels before initiating transactions. Practical implications Practically, blockchain technology has the potential to deal with the numerous issues affecting the smooth operation of skin lands acquisition and title registration in Ghana. Once the enumerated issues are resolved, there will be certainty of title to and ownership of land and property to drive investments because lenders could more easily ascertain owners of land parcels that could be used as collateral for securing loans. Similarly, property developers and land purchasers could easily identify rightful owners for land transactions. The government would be able to identify owners for land and property taxation. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature on blockchain and application to land acquisition and title registration with a focus on a specific customary land ownership system.",10.1108/JPPEL-12-2019-0062,"Mintah, Kwabena; Baako, Kingsley Tetteh; Kavaarpuo, Godwin; Otchere, Gideon Kwame"

Matching daily home health-care demands with supply in service-sharing platforms,2021,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.8047454447298883,"The availability of innovative technologies (e.g., the Internet of Things, big data analytics, blockchain, the cloud, and applications) has led to a shift in the provision of home health-care (HHC) services from traditional institutions to service-sharing platforms. In the HHC context, one main challenge faced by service-sharing platforms is the matching of demand with supply, while considering the heterogeneity of care requests and service providers. From a centralized perspective of service-sharing platforms regarding three stakeholders (i.e., platform, caregiver, and customer), different matching strategies are used, including the “self-interested”, “customer-first”, “hard-work-happy-life”, and “social-welfare” strategies. When addressing the matching problem at an operational level, the platforms must comply with various requirements and rules, including break requirements, temporal dependencies, and flexible service durations. In this study, mixed-integer linear programming models and a branch-and-price approach are designed to match demand with supply using different matching strategies while satisfying all of the requirements and rules. The effects of key factors on performance indicators (e.g., platform revenue, caregiver profit, and customer surplus) are examined, and the matching strategies are compared. The results indicate that the “customer-first” and “self-interested” strategies benefit more from flexible service durations, however they are more and less negatively affected by break requirements and temporal dependencies, respectively, as compared to the “social-welfare” and “hard-work-happy-life” strategies. A comparison between the “social-welfare” strategy and the other three strategies indicates that the former strategy is beneficial for all three stakeholders of the service-sharing platforms as well as the government. Another comparison between the service-sharing platforms and traditional HHC institutions indicates the sharing economy has a positive impact on caregiver profit and customer surplus.",10.1016/j.tre.2020.102177,"Lin, Meiyan; Ma, Lijun; Ying, Chengshuo"

Self-sovereign identity management in ciphertext policy attribute based encryption for IoT protocols,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5975946236502336,"In the Internet of Things, access control and identity management rely on centralized platforms. However, centralized platforms will compromise user privacy with identity leakage. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a novel model for identity management that does not require third-party centralized authority. Thus, SSI is a potential solution to the identity management problem in IoT access control. This paper’s motivation is to address the problems of lack of identity sovereignty, centralized authorization, and high computational overhead for IoT access control. We propose a novel access control scheme for IoT that decentralizes identity management and tackles single-point-of-failure issues. This scheme leverages ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and SSI to achieve the overall goal. Specifically, Our scheme eliminates the central authority and empowers users to manage their identity, allowing users to decide what attributes they disclose. Regarding the distribution of roles in the architecture, this paper follows the generic SSI model (ISSUER–HOLDER—VERIFIER) that allows a user to access a service from a service provider. To enable real-world deployment of our scheme, we establish an attribute authorization authority(such as the government) as a trusted identity point of entry. Users generate decentralized identifiers to enjoy services of interest in a privacy-preserving manner. The analysis demonstrates the practicality and superiority of our scheme. Our scheme requires less computation and is suitable for resource-constrained IoT scenarios.",10.1016/j.jisa.2024.103885,"Deng, Weichu; Li, Jin; Yan, Hongyang; Voundi Koe, Arthur Sandor; huang, Teng; Wang, Jianfeng; Peng, Cong"

Towards a circular economy for packaging waste by using new technologies: The case of large multinationals in emerging economies,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.850009246428527,"Earth’s capacity to sustain mankind is reaching a tipping point. Packaging waste is one of the critical problems that is leading to such a situation and a focus of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. However, large multinational enterprises look at their products and its packaging in a separate way, which leads them to think that when the product is consumed, their responsibility ends, leaving the government to deal with the issue of managing the packaging waste. Due to the complexity of the issue and the fact that this is particularly problematic in emerging markets, we used an in-depth and longitudinal case study analysis. We found that there were a desire and ability, with the use of the right technology, among urban groups to tackle the problem if with the right incentives to the different involved actors and from a holistic perspective. Our findings allowed us to advance a holistic framework based on incentives by using digitalization and new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence. Doing so, we advance the theory in the circular economy by enhancing it with the use of new technologies and advance a resources value loop that adds to the product life cycle theory.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125139,"Ajwani-Ramchandani, Raji; Figueira, Sandra; Torres de Oliveira, Rui; Jha, Shishir; Ramchandani, Amit; Schuricht, Louisa"
How can the holder trust the verifier? A CP-ABPRE-based solution to control the access to claims in a Self-Sovereign-Identity scenario,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7769971613345374,"The interest in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in research, industry, and governments is rapidly increasing. SSI is a paradigm where users hold their identity and credentials issued by authorized entities. SSI is revolutionizing the concept of digital identity and enabling the definition of a trust framework wherein a service provider (verifier) validates the claims presented by a user (holder) for accessing services. However, current SSI solutions primarily focus on the presentation and verification of claims, overlooking a dual aspect: ensuring that the verifier is authorized to access the holder's claims. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces an innovative SSI-based solution that integrates decentralized wallets with Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Proxy Re-Encryption (CP-ABPRE). This combination effectively addresses the challenge of verifier authorization. Our solution, implemented on the Ethereum platform, enhances accountability by notarizing key operations through a smart contract. This paper also offers a prototype demonstrating the practicality of the proposed approach. Furthermore, it provides an extensive evaluation of the solution's performance, emphasizing its feasibility and efficiency in real-world applications.",10.1016/j.bcra.2024.100196,"Buccafurri, Francesco; De Angelis, Vincenzo; Nardone, Roberto"
An analysis of housing affordability in Malaysia: random effect approach,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Purpose The purpose of this study paper is to highlight certain related barriers and issues of housing affordability and examine the factors that influence housing affordability in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach This study used panel data including several variables, namely, household expense, population, home financing, interest rate, inflation rate (IF) and rental rate (RR). The regression models of panel data, namely, the ordinary least square model, the fixed effects model and the random effects model, were evaluated for their suitability. Findings The findings revealed that RR and IF have a positive and significant impact towards housing affordability. The results provide strong evidence that RR as alternative in determining the home affordability as it helped in reducing the cost and the financing duration period of houses while at the same time increasing the level of capability of homeownership. Meanwhile, the level of IF has positive and significant impact towards housing affordability because it will cause a drop or increase in the purchasing power of households, as well as a decline or increase in the capability to own a house. Research limitations/implications The most significant aspects to consider when analysing housing affordability in Malaysia are demand and supply. However, this study focuses on only five variables and only covers Malaysia. As a result, future researchers should analyse the study’s location, such as by region or district, and include additional variables from both the demand and supply sides. Homeownership of affordability requires a broader and more realistic definition in the current context of a more disruptive environment where technology such as fintech, blockchain and the internet of things acts as enablers for not only promoting homeownership but also ensuring homeownership sustainability. As a result, democratising Islamic home financing appears to be a viable option that requires rethinking, and further research is recommended. Practical implications The study proposes an end-to-end solution to promote homeownership levels by considering the level of RR as significant variables among stakeholders such as the house buyers/owners, sellers, investors as well the government agencies in influencing affordability in Malaysia. Originality/value This paper discusses the indicators of housing affordability index over the 21-year period of 2000–2020, covering all states in Malaysia. The comparison of affordability level can be seen through all states and by regions. Besides that, the findings revealed that RR and IF have a positive and significant impact towards housing affordability. RR is considered an essential variable in promoting homeownership in Malaysia and warrants further investigation towards policy implication. This paper also provides contribution on data on RR by states in Malaysia that can be used by policymakers to some extent.",10.1108/JIABR-05-2022-0132,"Musaddad, Hafirda Akma; Maamor, Selamah; Zainol, Zairy"

Unlike prior research on consumer adoption, this study examines unique factors influencing the adoption of small and medium entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach Based on the experiences of firm owners (entrepreneurs), managers and key stakeholders, a phenomenological qualitative approach investigates factors driving cryptocurrency adoption within entrepreneurial firms in Pakistan. The study is framed by the extended Technology-Organization-Environment-Innovation (TOE-I) framework and social cognitive theory (SCT). Semi-structured interviews and narrative analysis uncover key determinants and adoption trajectories. Findings Thematic analysis identifies critical factors influencing cryptocurrency adoption, including technological aspects (e.g. Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, cybersecurity risks), organizational components (e.g. digital transformation assets) and environmental factors (e.g. the role of national and local government institutions and industry transitions). It also highlights the importance of innovation characteristics of entrepreneurs such as digital literacy, strategic networking and collaboration, adaptability and flexibility, and senior management (older employees) education. Additionally, the study outlines limitations and directions for future research about the conceptual framework. Originality/value This research enhances the understanding of crypto-driven innovation in entrepreneurial firms by integrating the TOE-I and SCT frameworks, offering a deeper theoretical perspective on technology adoption. It highlights how regulatory frameworks, cultural-religious considerations (e.g. Islamic rulings—fatwa and haram aspects of cryptocurrency), and social stigma intersect with SCT factors to influence adoption. Furthermore, the extended factor of entrepreneurial innovation characteristics within the TOE framework intersects with the self-efficacy and observation dimensions of SCT. The study provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, entrepreneurs and stakeholders to address adoption barriers, foster innovation and accelerate cryptocurrency integration.",10.1108/JSBED-11-2024-0580,"Nazir, Muhammad Arsalan; Roomi, Muhammad Azam; Khan, Mohsin Raza"
A paradigm shift in appointment Scheduling: Introducing a decentralized integrated Online booking system,2024,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.8025440293448671,"Long wait times, coordination, and integration are persistent issues in many health systems, hindering effective management of client waitlists and delaying treatment. The traditional approach of independent scheduling at each center does not allow for a coordinated response to demand fluctuations. An Integrated Online Booking system (IOB) for outpatient services is designed in this study, presenting the first central intake-based appointment system integrated with an optimization approach and a novel decentralized and distributed appointment system. This system considers the independence of centers while better responding to demand and improving overall system performance. The optimization component of the IOB system is expanded in this paper to include multiple sites, patient preferences, priorities, and wait time targets. It becomes a large-scale problem as all requests from a geographical region are combined into one stream. A decomposable algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used for this system. The study employs real large-scale MRI data from all hospitals in Ontario, Canada, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the IOB system, providing insights into its potential impact on healthcare operations. The results indicate that the IOB system can outperform common appointment scheduling approaches in terms of reducing patient wait times, balancing utilization rates, improving referral patterns, and enhancing system efficiency. The proposed IOB system can bring added value to the market by speeding up diagnosis and treatment processes while improving the efficiency of healthcare systems. This platform can be considered as Software as a Service (SaaS), providing a scalable and accessible solution for managing appointments across various sectors, and leveraging blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof appointment records. This study provides insights for decision-makers, highlighting the importance of effective scheduling in managing client waitlists during treatment in the healthcare sector, such as elective surgery, home healthcare, physical and mental therapies, and other service industries like education, public consultations, and government services. The IOB system can be integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools and machine learning methods and combined with other service software to optimize appointment scheduling and improve system performance.",10.1016/j.eswa.2024.124836,"Seyedi, Pardis; Eshghi, Kourosh; Carter, Michael W."
Determining the provenance and authenticity of seafood: A review of current methodologies,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9703334024371233,"Background Globally, food provenance has become a concern for government authorities, the seafood industry and consumers due to increasing food safety and authenticity requirements. Wild-catch fisheries and aquaculture are both important industries; aquaculture is seen as an opportunity to strengthen food security for the growing global population. However, unregulated aquaculture can expose consumers to health risks from pathogens, antibiotics and banned chemicals. Consumers and retailers, and the reputation of the global seafood industry, is affected by food fraud through species substitution and the exchange of aquaculture produce with wild-caught product and vice versa. To ensure consumer confidence and to allow authorities to effectively enforce regulations and contain risks, methods to determine the species, production methods and geographic origin of seafood need to be readily available. Scope and approach This review summarises the currently available and emerging methodologies to determine the provenance and authenticity of seafood. The main focus of this review is to give an overview of the methods that could potentially be used by authorities to enforce regulations and to contain risks, and for the seafood industry to self-regulate and protect itself from food fraud. Key findings and conclusions The most common methods used are DNA profiling, fatty acid profiling, different methods of inductively coupled plasma spectrometry and stable isotope analysis. Additionally, methods such as blockchain, radio frequency identification and x-ray fluorescence through Itrax are currently being tested for their effectiveness in determining seafood provenance. However, these methods have drawbacks and it is likely that a combination of methods would be best suited to determine the provenance of seafood considering its complex supply chain.",10.1016/j.tifs.2019.07.010,"Gopi, Karthik; Mazumder, Debashish; Sammut, Jesmond; Saintilan, Neil"
Blockchain on stool land acquisition: Lessons from Ghana for strengthening land tenure security other than titling,2021,3,Topic_3_registration_property_records,0.7876851569942653,"The paper develops a blockchain-enabled framework for stool land acquisition in Ghana that makes it possible for parties with interest in lands to object to their sale if the transaction is being conducted on their blind side. The framework also makes it possible for potential land buyers to authenticate in real-time the ownership status of the land they want to acquire–whether the property is registered with the Lands Commission or has been deregistered from the Commission’s records. The framework is a response to Ghana’s current opaque and weakly coordinated land administration systems flourishing the phenomenon of multiple sale of same lands and other land tenure security problems in the country. Further to providing a blockchain-enabled stool lands acquisition framework that enhances transparency, accountability, and better land records keeping in Ghana, the paper takes issues with the view widely held in international development, government, judicial, and some academic circles that titling or lease registration is the only or primary viable means of securing land rights. Our findings from Ghana show that in addition to creating predatory economies for powerful land sector actors (e.g., chiefs and land administrators) to extort outrageous sums of money from land buyers, the heavy emphasis on land titling or lease registration undermines efforts at strengthening other less cumbersome, less costly and less corruption-laden aspects of land administration to improve property rights in the land sector.",10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105635,"Mintah, Kwabena; Boateng, Festival Godwin; Baako, Kingsley Tetteh; Gaisie, Eric; Otchere, Gideon Kwame"
The role of digital technologies in supporting and improving fishery and aquaculture across the supply chain – Quo Vadis?,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Fish constitute important high protein products to meet the demands of an increasing global population. However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology.",10.1016/j.aaf.2022.06.003,"Rowan, Neil J."
Authentication and Authorization in Modern Web Apps for Data Security Using Nodejs and Role of Dark Web,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8180916700600234,"Authentication and Authorization are the base of security for all the Technologies present in this world today. Starting from your smartphone where a user authenticates himself before he could access the data inside to Entering into the White House, you must authenticate yourself, and based on that you are authorized. In this digital world where every Business, MNC, Government Body, Companies, Users, etc. needs a website to inform the world about their presence on the internet, provide services online and become a “Brand”, the risk of leaking user's sensitive information increases. It could be dangerous to the users of the hacked website because their sensitive information like a credit card, bank account details, etc. could be sold in the black market of the “dark web”. The role of the dark web is described in the paper and how the data is sold there and what becomes of it. The paper helps to understand how a secure website is developed that promises the user to keep the sensitive information safe, increases the bond of trust between a client and server which results in a long-term relationship. The aim behind developing an authentication system is to keep users’ sensitive information safe so that hackers cannot steal and sell the information on the dark web's back market. To perform this, the developer needs to understand how to implement authentication. NodeJS, with the help of its framework expressJS and some other packages, is used to develop the authentication and authorization system of the website by the research. Previous papers on this field covered the authentication topic in general. This paper overcame that by going deeper into the field and being server-side language specific.

Energy supply chain efficiency in the digital era: Evidence from China's listed companies,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"With the widespread adoption of cutting-edge digital technologies, including big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing, the development and digitalization of the supply chain are experiencing significant integration. According to China's Fourteenth Five-Year Plan for a Modern Energy System, the country has embarked on a new phase of constructing a modern energy system. An accelerating trend in the digital upgrading of energy businesses marks a period of innovation and upgrading for the modern energy industry. Although policy documents highlight the role of digital technology in advancing the digital transformation of energy businesses, the underlying relationships and transmission mechanisms have yet to be fully explored, underscoring the necessity for targeted policy development. This study examines the link between enterprise digital transformation and energy supply chain efficiency, utilizing a bidirectional fixed-effects framework and analyzing data from 112 listed companies in the energy sector from 2011 to 2019. Employing a three-stage DEA model and text analysis to measure the primary indicators, findings suggest that digital transformation enhances energy supply chain efficiency by fostering technological innovation, leveraging government subsidies, and increasing openness levels. Moreover, the positive impact is more pronounced in large and private enterprises, especially in the eastern and northeastern regions. This study offers empirical support for the policy framework mentioned, advocating for the advancement of business digital transformation, the establishment and enhancement of digital supply chain systems, and the integration of supply chain enterprise resources upstream and downstream.",10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107597,"Fu, Shuke; Ge, Yingchen; Hao, Yu; Peng, Jiachao; Tian, Jiali"
Towards a Requirement-driven Digital Twin Architecture,2022,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.929885382194314,"The fourth industrial revolution introduces new technological innovations and amplifies the importance of some existing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Blockchain, amongst others. Digital Twin (DT) has emerged as one of the most prominent technologies of this era and has caught the attention of the industry, academia, and governments. However, the realisation of the full potential of DT is challenged by the lack of standard terminologies and practices, amongst others. This is reflected in the state-of-the-art in DT architectures, which indicates that there is no widely accepted DT framework. Literature on DT architecture is dominated by application- and/or technology-specific architectures with components and connectors that not only vary extensively but are named differently. The use of different terminologies for components could hinder the ability to identify commonality in frameworks and makes it difficult for new entrants in the field to find guidance. Also, literature does not clarify on the connection between the requirements and the components of a DT architecture. To address these problems, this paper proposes a requirement-driven, technology-agnostic DT architecture that consists of standard components that can be traceable to the definitions, requirements, and mandatory functionalities of DT captured in existing literature. The architecture can be applied to various fields and uses cases, based on their respective needs. The paper aims at providing guidance for developing digital twin architectures for a flexible spectrum of applications.",10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.058,"Nwogu, Chukwudi; Lugaresi, Giovanni; Anagnostou, Anastasia; Matta, Andrea; Taylor, Simon J.E."
Blockchain Technology for Detecting Falsified and Substandard Drugs in Distribution: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Intervention,2018,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.8443284094089737,"Background Drug counterfeiting is a global problem with significant risks to consumers and the general public. In the Philippines, 30% of inspected drug stores in 2003 were found with substandard/spurious/falsely-labeled/falsified/counterfeit drugs. The economic burden on the population drug expenditures and on governments is high. The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the public to check the certificates of product registration and report any instances of counterfeiting. The National Police of Philippines responds to such reports through a special task force. However, no literature on its impact on the distribution of such drugs were found. Blockchain technology is a cryptographic ledger that is allegedly immutable through repeated sequential hashing and fault-tolerant through a consensus algorithm. This project will develop and test a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system that will support information sharing along the official drug distribution network. Objective This study aims to develop a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system and test its functions in a simulated network. Methods We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System (DFS). Two instances will be developed: one for Ethereum and another for Hyperledger Fabric. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm of Ethereum will be modified into a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm as it is scalable and fits the drug supply chain environment. The system will adopt the GS1 pedigree standard and will satisfy the data points in the data standardization guidelines from the US FDA. Simulations will use the following 5 nodes: for FDA, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and the consumer portal. Results Development is underway. The design of the system will place FDA in a supervisory data verification role, with each pedigree type–specific data source serving a primary data verification role. The supply chain process will be initiated by the manufacturer, with recursive verification for every transaction. It will allow consumers to scan a code printed on the receipt of their purchases to review the drug distribution history. Conclusions Development and testing will be conducted in a simulated network, and thus, results may differ from actual practice. The project being proposed is disruptive; once tested, the team intends to engage the Philippine FDA to discuss implementation plans and formulate policies to facilitate adoption and sustainability.

Poverty mitigation via solar panel adoption: Smart contracts and targeted subsidy design,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9454497751835229,"An emerging application of FinTech in the commodities market pivots on a blockchain-enabled Peer-to-Peer energy exchange platform, wherein solar energy feed-in tariffs are self-executed via “smart contracts”. With subsidy design versus mechanism design models, this paper evaluates the instrumental value of smart contracts towards poverty mitigation in developing economies via securing sustainable revenue for rural households. We investigate how the adoption levels of solar panels interact with adoption barriers and household energy behaviors. Smart contracts can be applied for self-executing the green energy financing and subsidy distribution process. For the government-led subsidy design scheme, we propose Cournot quantity competition models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity (energy-poor and energy-rich regions) and uncertainty in energy generation costs. We find that the government’s aggregate subsidy expenditure decreases in solar uncertainty, and it is optimal to select households from a single region only for high uncertainty. Smart contracts facilitate heterogeneity and uncertainty to soften quantity competition, benefitting households in both regions and the government. For the mechanism design scheme, we demonstrate that both regions can be chosen only under the incomplete information case with inaccurate forecasts about market conditions and a relatively low baseline energy price. The self-executing feature of smart contracts helps mitigate the potential risks of renegotiation between multiple parties. Moreover, a public policy supported by mechanism design is more likely to outperform that based on market competition regarding cost-effectiveness only when the latter chooses a single region. Otherwise, quantity competition would be significantly softened by contingency-dependent smart contracts under heterogeneous market conditions.",10.1016/j.omega.2020.102367,"Guo, Qiaozhen; He, Qiao-Chu; Chen, Ying-Ju; Huang, Wei"

Safeguarding a formalized Blockchain-enabled identity-authentication protocol by applying security risk-oriented patterns,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7919446799750723,"Designing government independent and secure identification- and authentication protocols is a challenging task. Design flaws and missing specifications as well as security- and privacy issues of such protocols pose considerable user risks. Formal methods, such as Colored Petri Nets (CPN), are utilised for the design, development and analysis of such new protocols in order to detect flaws and mitigate identified security risks before deployment. This paper fills the gap, by applying in a novel way a set of security risk-oriented patterns (SRP) to the so-called Authcoin protocol that we formalise using CPN. The initial formal model of Authcoin facilitates the detection and elimination of design flaws, missing specifications as well as security- and privacy issues. The additional risk- and threat analysis based on the Information Systems Security Risk Management (ISSRM) domain model we perform on the formal CPN models of the protocol. The identified risks are mitigated by applying SRPs to the formal model of the Authcoin protocol. SRPs are a means to mitigate common security- and privacy risks in a business-process context by applying thoroughly tested and proven best-practice solutions.

Communitarianism, which broadly strives for autonomy from established institutions, promises the development of self-provisioning communities based on cooperative networks and participatory, democratic governance that prioritizes use over exchange value and redistribution over profitable activity for individuals. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology has ushered in new affordances such as scaling a communitarian enterprise and exchange of value independent of banks or other institutions. Whereas market-based organizations use Web 3 affordances for accounting purposes for profit, communitarian organizations aim to link accounting with designs to inject capital into a commons to support self-governing communities in community-based peer production (CBPP). To exemplify the broad range of approaches to the multifaceted goals of CBPP, I focus on FairCoop and Sensorica. Despite considerable differences, these organizations nonetheless share problems and generally are illustrative of longstanding challenges to communitarian enterprises – digitalized and non-digitalized alike. Perennial problems such as the fraught capitalist/postcapitalist relation, self-interest, uneven power relations, lack of diversity, and the challenge of responding adequately to societal needs combine with effects of automated governance and associated effects of technocracy that can dissolve founding values to threaten the integrity of a communitarian collective. CBPP as well as its non-digitalized counterparts are important contributions to humanity, but goals and actual practices can diverge. CBPP requires vigilant designs that complement rather than replace human decision making with algorithmic governance and pay attention to reflexivity and positionality, continual re-design to engage unanticipated problems, and distancing actually existing projects from discourses that reify patterns such as decentralization with the consequence of missing crucial contextual knowledges.",10.1016/j.diggeo.2024.100080,"Ettlinger, Nancy"

Building an analytical decision tree model under which a recycler maximizes expected returns, we explore the influence of supervision on the choices a recycler faces and provide an analytical solution that describes the boundaries that separate those choices. Using our framework, we systematically catalog which interventions may help and which may not. The model suggests that direct unqualified subsidies to recyclers may not be particularly effective, although properly targeted subsidies have promise. We also find that there are substitution effects between increasing the cost of fraud and decreasing the costs of proper electronic waste recycling. That is, increasing the cost of fraud can serve as a policy instrument to produce effects similar to decreasing a recycler’s costs from engaging in honest behavior. We also discuss the role of digital fraud prevention technologies such as blockchain as another mechanism to help achieve sustainability outcomes in e-waste management while lowering the costs of third-party supervision.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105613,"Salmon, Daniel; Babbitt, Callie W.; Babbitt, Gregory A.; Wilmer, Christopher E."
Blockchain-Enabled iWellChain Framework Integration With the National Medical Referral System: Development and Usability Study,2019,1,Topic_1_healthcare_privacy_records,0.9141681920434908,"Background Medical referral is the transfer of a patient’s care from one physician to another upon request. This process involves multiple steps that require provider-to-provider and provider-to-patient communication. In Taiwan, the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) has implemented a national medical referral (NMR) system, which encourages physicians to refer their patients to different health care facilities to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and the financial stress on the national health insurance. However, the NHIA’s NMR system is a government-based electronic medical referral service, and its referral data access and exchange are limited to authorized clinical professionals using their national health smart cards over the NHIA virtual private network. Therefore, this system lacks scalability and flexibility and cannot establish trusting relationships among patients, family doctors, and specialists. Objective To eliminate the existing restrictions of the NHIA’s NMR system, this study developed a scalable, flexible, and blockchain-enabled framework that leverages the NHIA’s NMR referral data to build an alliance-based medical referral service connecting health care facilities. Methods We developed a blockchain-enabled framework that can integrate patient referral data from the NHIA’s NMR system with electronic medical record (EMR) and electronic health record (EHR) data of hospitals and community-based clinics to establish an alliance-based medical referral service serving patients, clinics, and hospitals and improve the trust in relationships and transaction security. We also developed a blockchain-enabled personal health record decentralized app (DApp) based on our blockchain-enabled framework for patients to acquire their EMR and EHR data; DApp access logs were collected to assess patients’ behavior and investigate the acceptance of our personal authorization-controlled framework. Results The constructed iWellChain Framework was installed in an affiliated teaching hospital and four collaborative clinics. The framework renders all medical referral processes automatic and paperless and facilitates efficient NHIA reimbursements. In addition, the blockchain-enabled iWellChain DApp was distributed for patients to access and control their EMR and EHR data. Analysis of 3 months (September to December 2018) of access logs revealed that patients were highly interested in acquiring health data, especially those of laboratory test reports. Conclusions This study is a pioneer of blockchain applications for medical referral services, and the constructed framework and DApp have been applied practically in clinical settings. The iWellChain Framework has the scalability to deploy a blockchain environment effectively for health care facilities; the iWellChain DApp has potential for use with more patient-centered applications to collaborate with the industry and facilitate its adoption.",10.2196/13563,"Lo, Yu-Sheng; Yang, Cheng-Yi; Chien, Hsiung-Fei; Chang, Shy-Shin; Lu, Chung-Ying; Chen, Ray-Jade"

Sustainable smart waste management solutions for rapidly urbanizing African Cities,2025,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.7767931511248488,"The increasing waste volumes in African cities highlight the urgent need for innovative and sustainable waste management solutions to mitigate climate change, reduce health risks, and support urban development. Rapid urbanization has exacerbated these challenges, as existing waste management systems often suffer from inefficiencies, inadequate coverage, and environmental impacts such as pollution of aquatic ecosystems. This study systematically evaluates the challenges and opportunities of integrating smart waste management technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain into waste collection and processing in African cities. Specifically, the research aims to assess the efficiency of smart waste management solutions in urban settings, identify barriers to implementing Centralized Smart Waste Management (CSWM) in African contexts, and propose a scalable framework tailored to the region's socio-economic and infrastructural conditions. Through a comprehensive review of contemporary waste management practices and global technological advancements, including case studies from South Korea and India, this study introduces a hypothetical CSWM framework. The proposed model integrates predictive waste volume sensing, real-time monitoring, and automated sorting and disposal systems to enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource utilization, and minimize environmental harm. While the CSWM framework offers economic, environmental, and social benefits, including enhanced resource recovery, job creation, and long-term cost savings, its implementation faces challenges such as infrastructure limitations, high costs, and the need for stakeholder engagement. Addressing these barriers requires collaborative efforts among governments, the private sector, and community organizations, alongside policy innovations such as tax incentives, regulatory reforms, and public-private partnerships. This study provides a structured roadmap for transitioning African cities toward efficient, resilient, and environmentally sustainable waste management systems by aligning technological advancements with sustainable policies and active stakeholder participation.",10.1016/j.jup.2025.101961,"Atofarati, Emmanuel O.; Adogbeji, Victor O.; Enweremadu, Christopher C."

Blockchain-based royalty contract transactions scheme for Industry 4.0 supply-chain management,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.6549577095592735,"Industry 4.0-based oil and gas supply-chain (OaG-SC) industry automates and efficiently executes most of the processes by using cloud computing (CC), artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of things (IoT), and industrial Internet of things (IIoT). However, managing various operations in OaG-SC industries is a challenging task due to the involvement of various stakeholders. It includes landowners, Oil and Gas (OaG) company operators, surveyors, local and national level government bodies, financial institutions, and insurance institutions. During mining, OaG company needs to pay incentives as a royalty to the landowners. In the traditional existing schemes, the process of royalty transaction is performed between the OaG company and landowners as per the contract between them before the start of the actual mining process. These contracts can be manipulated by attackers (insiders or outsiders) for their advantages, creating an unreliable and un-trusted royalty transaction. It may increase disputes between both parties. Hence, a reliable, cost-effective, trusted, secure, and tamper-resistant scheme is required to execute royalty contract transactions in the OaG industry. Motivated from these research gaps, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based scheme, which securely executes the royalty transactions among various stakeholders in OaG industries. We evaluated the performance of the proposed scheme and the smart contracts’ functionalities and compared it with the existing state-of-the-art schemes using various parameters.

However, the fierce environmental problems associated with human activities and economic development cannot be neglected. To systematically analyze the research status and development trend of the maritime industry, this paper collects and reviews literature from Elsevier ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases related to green shipping management and green port construction. Future research directions are presented based on the analysis. The results show that green shipping management focus on solving practical emission reduction problems. Most work of green port construction establish mathematical optimization models aiming at minimizing total operation costs or maximizing profits. Designing efficient algorithms is a research hotspot in operation management. By comparing the technical measures, operational strategy, and market-based measures, we found technical innovation is the ultimate way for the maritime industry to realize net zero-emission. Support from governments and organizations is the insurance of green development. Future research perspectives include adopting high-tech technologies such as blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligent to improve operation efficiency and reduce emissions, providing more accurate suggestions for constructing green and smart ports, proposing multi-objective optimization models and highlighting the environmental target.

BIM security: A critical review and recommendations using encryption strategy and blockchain,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.845232890178332,"Security of information in collaborative BIM platforms is crucial particularly for critical projects such as that of government buildings, prisons, and power plants. Inappropriate distribution and loss of sensitive information may potentially lead to physical security threats, financial loss, and loss of trust and reputation. Therefore, this paper identifies the information security requirements of collaborative BIM platforms considering the characteristics related to data security of collaborative BIM platforms through a literature review and as a result, identifies seven components of BIM security, based on which defines three levels of BIM security. Existing cybersecurity facilitating technologies such as encryption protocols, distributed database technology, and blockchain technology are reviewed to assess applicability to BIM security. This review shows that although the technologies to support BIM security are available in research and on market, they are not customized in existing collaborative BIM platforms to support BIM security. Therefore, two conceptual frameworks are proposed – (1) an encryption strategy-based framework to facilitate secure storage and distribution of BIM and (2) a blockchain-based framework to record BIM changes in a tamper-proof ledger for the non-trusting environment of construction projects.

Private blockchain-based access control mechanism for unauthorized UAV detection and mitigation in Internet of Drones environment,2021,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.5022204687032545,"Drones, which are also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are very useful in delivering the packages, and real-time object detection and tracking with minimal human interference. However, there may be several security threats in such an environment, for instance, a malicious user can spy unauthorized drones, transfer malicious packages, or even damage the network reliability that can have direct impact on drones control. This may lead to a potential threat for people, governments, and business sectors. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel access control scheme for unauthorized UAV detection and mitigation in an Internet of Drones (IoD) environment, called ACSUD-IoD. With the help of the blockchain-based solution incorporated in ACSUD-IoD, the transactional data having both the normal secure data from a drone (UAV) to the Ground Station Server (GSS) and the abnormal (suspected) data for detection of unauthorized UAVs by the GSS are stored in private blockchain, that are authentic and genuine. As a result, the Big data analytics can be performed on the authenticated transactional data stored in the blockchain. Through the detailed security analysis including formal security under the broadly-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, formal security verification using the widely-applied Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool and non-mathematical security analysis show the robustness of the proposed scheme against a number of potential attacks needed in an IoD environment. The testbed experiments for various cryptographic primitives using the broadly-accepted Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library (MIRACL) have been performed under both server and Raspberry PI 3 configurations. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis among the proposed scheme and other existing competing schemes shows the efficacy and more robustness as compared to the existing schemes. Finally, the blockchain-based practical demonstration shows the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",10.1016/j.comcom.2020.12.005,"Bera, Basudeb; Das, Ashok Kumar; Sutrala, Anil Kumar"

This article built a point-axis-region location driving system to analyze the spatial location differentiation of characteristic villages and towns (CVTS) using the kernel density model, and explored the mechanism of location driving factors with a geographical detector model. The results show that vegetables and fruits are the main types of products in CVTS. They account for 27.60% and 34.68% of all types of products, and occur mainly in the east and central regions of China. Moreover, all point-axis-region driving factors have a significant influence on grain crops. The mean values of driving forces of vegetables and fruits are larger than other types of CVTS, and their values are 0.12 and 0.11. The average driving forces on all CVTS in the northeast are higher than those in other regions, especially the driving forces of vegetables and medicinal crops (0.24 and 0.18, respectively).

Financial implications of fourth industrial revolution: Can bitcoin improve prospects of energy investment?,2020,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.9335524823619108,"Bitcoin and the blockchain technology on which it is based are the key drivers behind the accelerated pace of Fourth Industrial Revolution in the domain of Finance. The offshoots of this technology however are not limited and are rapidly spreading in other domains such as oil market. This paper investigates the causality or influences that both markets, Bitcoin price (BP) and oil price (OP) have on each other by applying the bootstrap Granger causal relationship tests considering full as well as sub-samples. Our analysis reveals that shocks originated in OP and transmitted towards BP can be both positive or negative. The positive impact indicates that Bitcoin can be viewed as an asset helpful in avoiding the risks of the high OP, which also indicates that Bitcoin and oil are in the same boat, however, the negative effects cannot support this view. The negative influence of OP on BP can be explained by the burst of the Bitcoin bubble which has weakened its hedging ability. In turn, there is also a negative influence or reverse causality running from BP to OP, highlighting that the demand for oil by investors can be threatened by the increasing BP. Keeping in view the more integrated and complexed financial dynamics which are the results of Fourth Industrial Revolution, investors can benefit from this interrelationship to diversify the risks and optimize their investment by building a more balanced portfolio. Also, governments could promote and protect the healthy development of the Bitcoin and energy market by preventing the Bitcoin bubbles and understanding the reasons of oil price volatility.",10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120178,"Su, Chi-Wei; Qin, Meng; Tao, Ran; Umar, Muhammad"

The Zero-trust model emphasizes the importance of verifying and authenticating every user and device, and limiting access to resources based on the principle of least privilege. Under the principle of the zero-trust model, devices are granted access after they have been successfully presented with their authentication credentials and access rights based on different factors, such as user identity, device health, location, and behaviour. Access controls are then continuously evaluated and updated as user properties, locations and behaviour change. The zero-trust model can be applied in various domains (healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, government etc.) to provide a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that helps organizations to reduce risk and protect critical assets. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the zero-trust model, its principles, and its applications, as well as to propose recommendations for organizations looking to adopt this approach.

This paper aims to systematically review the knowledge emerging from the literature at the intersection between Circular Economy and the EEE supply chain, with a special focus on enablers, levers, and their potential environmental, economic and social benefits. An original framework is developed to categorise Circular Economy enablers, levers and potential benefits. Companies in the EEE industry aiming to implement Circular Economy can exploit several enablers (grouped into digitalization, government intervention, and users’ active role) and levers (grouped into circular product design, servitised business models, and supply chain management) to generate economic, environmental and social benefits. Based on the framework, 115 articles were scrutinised. The analysis led to the definition of a research agenda, with policy and industry implications. To advance Circular Economy research in the EEE supply chain, future studies should address: (i) the enabling role of digitalization, particularly within blockchain, 3D Printing, augmented and virtual reality; (ii) design strategies focused on ‘reduce’; (iii) servitised business models based on result-oriented offerings; (iv) collaboration in the EEE supply chain; (v) the assessment of social and economic benefits to users.

Agri-food 4.0: Drivers and links to innovation and eco-innovation,2023,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Digital transformation affects all stages of the agri-food value chain. Digitalisation is being combined with innovations and eco-innovations to gain a competitive advantage and ensure greater sustained competitiveness. However, not all technologies have been implemented in the same way and at the same pace by the different companies in the agri-food sector. The aim of this research is to identify the internal and external drivers of digitalisation in agri-food companies and to develop a synthetic index to rank companies based on those drivers, before examining the relationship between the position in the ranking and innovation. The results reveal that the decisive drivers are management support and competitive pressure rather than external support from government policies or suppliers. Higher ranking companies in terms of the digitalisation process are more proactive in introducing product and radical innovations and are the most eco-innovative and thus sustainability-oriented. Finally, results show that the digitalisation of the sector is marked by the depth of technology implementation, specifically IoT, big data and artificial intelligence.

Transparency in food supply chains: A review of enabling technology solutions,2019,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,1.0,"Background Modern food supply chains are complex and contain numerous stakeholders, with each performing specific roles pertaining to food production. As food supply chains become more complex, the importance of food production transparency increases. Several factors contribute to the need for transparency such as an increase in the global population, detection of foodborne illness outbreaks, efficient management of risks and recalls, and satisfying consumer demand. A case in point is the necessity that food production systems become more sustainable through improvements in production efficiency and reducing the wasting of resources and food. Other examples include the need for timely identification of the source of food production, in addition to requiring a more rapid knowledge of the cause of contamination during outbreaks of foodborne illness. Scope and approach This review sets out to describe enabling technologies, provided by the Internet of Things (IoT), which have the potential to increase food production transparency. In addition, other technologies important for managing and using food supply chain data, such as blockchain and Big Data analytics, are reviewed. The IoT is the overarching technology which allows for data collection from multiple phases within supply chains leading to data driven transparent systems of food production. Key findings and conclusions Enabling transparency in food supply chains via implementation of technologies will require considerable effort from all stakeholders involved, resulting in many new challenges and requirements that must be addressed.

Leveraging intra-provincial regulatory differences in a post-Paris context: Cryptocurrency mining “reverse battery” strategy in Atlantic Canada,2024,0,Topic_0_security_iot_city,0.8169035161585939,"Cheap and abundant energy is an important incentive for the proliferation of cryptocurrency mining farms. With China's crackdown on bitcoin mining, investors have moved to the United States, Scandinavian countries, and Canada. From the perspective of business, these jurisdictions provide cheap, reliable electricity within a stable institutional context. At the same time, cryptocurrency mining has the potential to generate instability, not only through material demands on the capacity of the electricity grid, but also in jeopardizing governments’ climate goals. This article examines some strategies used by the industry to seek out favorable regulatory environments and take advantage of energy sources and infrastructures, through the case of HIVE blockchain technology, a mining company in Atlantic Canada. The article explains how in contrast with negative reports of marginal employment opportunities and drains on domestic energy supplies, bitcoin miners are developing new narratives to make cryptocurrency mining investment attractive to governments and the public. We find that HIVE has leveraged intra-provincial regulatory differences to expand operations and is currently using a “reverse battery” narrative to improve regulatory and public acceptance of cryptocurrency mining.",10.1016/j.exis.2023.101396,"Rosales, Antulio; Millar, Heather; Richardson, Andrew"
