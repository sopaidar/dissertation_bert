The new data distributed storage technology-blockchain, provides new methods and ideas for the circulation and sharing of data through the characteristics of decentralization, timing, distributed ledger, openness, and openness and transparency. This article analyzes the role and characteristics of blockchain technology in the file management distributed system under the background of big data. Starting from the connection between digital archives research and blockchain technology, the application prospects of blockchain technology in archives management are analyzed from different angles.', 'With the rapid development of the distributed network and communication, the Internet of Things (IoT) systems have been applied to all walks of life. Blockchain technology is one of the most popular research fields recently, which can provide a reliable storage solution and solve information security issues for IoT systems. Transaction information is the most critical fundamental data in the blockchain systems, which needs to be verified to avoid being tempered with by malicious nodes in the process of transmission. With the exponential growth of the number of IoT devices, the limitations of the current storage structure put too much pressure on the system nodes. How to improve verification efficiency has become a key challenge. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a novel high-performance verification mechanism for data security protection in blockchain-based IoT systems. We design a new storage structure based on Huffman trunk tree (HTT), and conduct the quantitative analysis of transaction weights. Transactions are stored in full-featured devices in the form of Huffman Merkle tree (HMT), and only the content of HTT is saved in lightweight devices. Finally, the performance superiority of our mechanism is proved through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation. In blockchain-based IoT systems, our mechanism significantly reduces the data transmission cost and computation overhead, effectively improving the efficiency of data verification.', 'The traditional centralized data processing mode can no longer meet the demand. Blockchain technology shows great potential in the field of data security and privacy protection with its decentralized, tamper-proof, transparent and highly secure characteristics. This paper first analyzes the risks of tampering and privacy leakage in the process of transmission, storage and sharing of distribution network data, and discusses how blockchain technology can improve the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data through its distributed account book structure, consensus mechanism, cryptography principle and smart contract. It is pointed out that blockchain technology can significantly improve the tamper resistance of distribution network data, realize data traceability, and enhance data security under the joint maintenance of multiple nodes. In terms of privacy protection, blockchain combines encryption technology and smart contracts to achieve refined data access control, while distributed storage effectively prevents centralized data leakage. In addition, this paper also discusses the application cases of blockchain technology in smart grid, data sharing and trading, fault detection and location, and user identity authentication and authorization management, and analyzes the challenges and solutions. Finally, this paper looks forward to the integration of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, big data and other emerging technologies, which will bring more innovative applications to the power industry.']"

But external store of data causes cloud storage service providers gain control of the data. Therefore, our work should consider how to ensure the privacy of data and maintain the integrity of data when enjoying convenient services. This paper builds a blockchain-based solution through research on cloud storage service model and blockchain technology. And related protocols are built on the solution-based architecture. In our solution, the decentralized model solves the single point of trust problem in the traditional data auditing service model by collective trust. A public agreement enables auditors to efficiently build proof of data integrity without touching data. The protocol allows users to trace the history of their data, and examine whether the owner of the data guarantees the privacy of the data in an after-the-fact audit. In addition, our work constructed the prototype system of the scheme and revealed the effectiveness of the scheme through system testing.', ""SWIM (System Wide Information Management) has become the development direction of A TM (Air Traffic Management) system by providing interoperable services to promote the exchange and sharing of data among various stakeholders. The premise of data sharing is security, and the access control has become the key guarantee for the secure sharing and exchange. The CP-ABE scheme (Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption) can realize one-to-many access control, which is suitable for the characteristics of SWIM environment. However, the combination of the existing CP-ABE access control and SWIM has following constraints. 1. The traditional single authority CP-ABE scheme requires unconditional trust in the authority center. Once the authority center is corrupted, the excessive authority of the center may lead to the complete destruction of system security. So, SWIM with a large user group and data volume requires multiple authorities CP-ABE when performing access control. 2. There is no unified management of users' data access records. Lack of supervision on user behavior make it impossible to effectively deter malicious users. 3. There are a certain proportion of lightweight data users in SWIM, such as aircraft, users with handheld devices, etc. And their computing capacity becomes the bottleneck of data sharing. Aiming at these issues above, this paper based on cloud-chain fusion basically proposes a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme, called the MOV ATM scheme, which has three advantages. 1. Based on a multi-cloud and multi-authority CP-ABE, this solution conforms to the distributed nature of SWIM; 2. This scheme provides outsourced computing and verification functions for lightweight users; 3. Based on blockchain technology, a blockchain that is maintained by all stakeholders of SWIM is designed. It takes user's access records as transactions to ensure that access records are well documented and cannot be tampered with. Compared with other schemes, this scheme adds the functions of multi-authority, outsourcing, verifiability and auditability, but do not increase the decryption cost of users."", ""As time goes on and technology gets better, various data-sharing technologies are becoming more and more integrated into many different businesses. Therefore, data exchange and security are crucial for the data's value to be realized. Nevertheless, it is challenging to verify the authenticity of a basic data sharing method in order to detect electronic data usage traces. An further difficulty is the reluctance of data suppliers to provide their data. Employing Blockchain's distributed ledger, smart contract, data trust, and traceability features. For the purpose of facilitating secure access to data, this study introduces a blockchain-based data-sharing architecture that optimizes to circumvent the security and control issues associated with traditional centralized data sharing and administration. In addition, the research evaluates the practicality and safety of the prototype. Furthermore, this paper proposes a Secured Data Management Scheme (SDMS) that utilizes blockchain technology to optimize data sharing efficiency. To assess the efficacy of this model, it is cross-validated with the conventional Data Privacy Handler (DPH) method. While present centralized security solutions fail to meet security requirements in an IoT setting, blockchain technology provides a decentralized solution. Through the use of a blockchain and a WiFi-enabled network model, this article seeks to offer a secure communication framework for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. According to the results, attitudes and character quirks have a role in how the intelligence community plans to use a blockchain-based data-sharing model for integrating systems. This research demonstrated the viability of using blockchain technology in an intelligence community-centric data-sharing strategy.""]"

Specifically, distributed healthcare records have brought ease to how hospitals and other different third parties access the sensitive medical health information of patients for various uses leading to generation of big data. Big data in healthcare is important as it can be used in the prediction of outcome of diseases, prevention of co-morbidities fatality and saving the cost of medical treatment. However, this has also made it easy for security breaches and privacy violations during the data collection process. In this paper, we propose a platform which uses the blockchain technology for privacy preservation during collection, management and distribution of EHR data. The aim of this paper is to ensure the total privacy, integrity and access control of distributed electronic health records to the data owners during its distribution on the blockchain. Simulated results demonstrate our proposed system establishes total transparency and ensures perfect privacy within the distributed network of sharing EHRs in the medical setting using the blockchain."", 'In the past decade, the digitalization of the health-care industry and electronic healthcare records (EHR) rises rapidly. The concept of smart health gradually gains momentum as information technology advances. Smart healthcare transforms and improves traditional medical systems in efficiency, service and personalization by integrating technologies like the internet of things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). On the other hand, smart healthcare systems are highly prone to security breaches and various malicious attacks. Blockchain technology has recently emerged as a promising solution for improving data management, access control, and integrity inside healthcare systems. This paper presents a survey of research on the latest blockchain solutions combined with AI technologies for improving and innovating new technical standards for the healthcare ecosystem related to medical diagnostics and electronic health records sharing, with a special focus on medical imaging.', ""The Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded because of the development of information technology. IoT impacts several fields, including the medical profession, smart cities, and data management. The development of sustainable medical systems is significantly aided by the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). IoMT has a big impact on healthcare since it makes it easier to monitor and validate data about patients before storing it in the cloud. Keeping all data confidential and secured is essential since the IoMT is a big-data platform that is expanding quickly.This paper will apply this technical advancement to the realm of health, namely e-health. The research provides an IoMT-based monitoring tool for personal health surveillance. Block chain technology may resolve present interoperability issues in health-related systems and offer technological solutions that allow the electronic transfer of medical records to medical organizations and medical specialists. However, the transmission and security of people's health data remain a major concern in IoMT devices across a wide range of product categories. This research uses block chain as a secure solution to satisfy the requirements of medical privacy and data security. In this study, a Block chain-based IoMT security System (BC-IoMT-SS) is presented based on BC technology in IoMT for the security, privacy, and management of patient information. The suggested framework is successfully implemented to fulfill the optimal privacy and safety criteria for medical data management in IoMT gadgets. Utilizing the block chain's key, a healthcare application system has been created in which the person's health data may safely generate alerts for verified healthcare practitioners. Simulation results demonstrate that the suggested BC-IoMT-SS technique produces a high precision ratio of 94%, an efficiency ratio of 94%, a shorter delay of 0.63s, and a shorter reaction time compared to other current methods.""]"

These technologies can transform four aspects: players, organisations, contextual elements, results, and functionality. This paper presents a summary of 10 case studies employing primarily 2 of these digital technologies (artificial intelligence, and big data) in the humanitarian supply chain. Then, it concentrates on discussing the role and convergence of these 2 technologies in enhancing the resiliency of the humanitarian supply chain. The potentials of AI and big data towards achieving human supply chain resilience, and areas for future works to support the convergence in facilitating the resiliency of the humanitarian supply chain are suggested.', 'The synergy between Industry 4.0, production, and supply chain management is transforming industrial ecosystems, enabling more intelligent, automated, and interconnected systems. This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of academic literature on Industry 4.0 technologies within these domains from 2011 to 2024.

It underscores the transformative potential of Industry 4.0 in reshaping production and supply chains while outlining future research directions, particularly regarding technological integration, sustainability challenges, and the necessity of global cooperation to advance smart and sustainable supply chains.', 'The growing environmental business uncertainties have forced companies to focus on developing more flexible supply chains. Digital transformation has been considered a key means to achieving such flexibility, but the literature lacks empirical evidence about how digital technologies effectively contribute to it. Thus, this study aims to analyze how Smart Supply Chain (i.e., a supply chain enabled by digital transformation) contributes to supply chain flexibility and operational performance in environments surrounded by customer and supplier uncertainty. We adopt the organizational information-processing theory to explain the fit between information needs to reduce these uncertainties through more supply chain flexibility (sourcing, delivery, and manufacturing) and information capabilities provided by three main dimensions of the Smart Supply Chain (digital transformation strategy, digital base technologies, and digital front-end technologies). We relate these information-processing fit between Smart Supply Chain and flexibility with the boundary conditions of environmental uncertainty and operational performance improvements. Such relationships are analyzed through moderation and mediation regression tests based on 379 manufacturing companies surveyed. Our findings show that Smart Supply Chain has a statistical association with operational performance through the sequential mediating role of the three supply chain flexibility dimensions. We also found that environments with high customer uncertainty increase the use of base technologies (IoT, cloud, big data, AI, and blockchain) to reach delivery flexibility and support manufacturing flexibility. When companies face high supplier uncertainty, they use front-end technologies (i.e., robotics, 3D printing, simulation, and augmented reality) to increase sourcing flexibility. We show new advances in supply chain flexibility through digital transformation.']"

As the quantity and quality of data produced by devices have also gradually increased, there have been increasing attempts to use these useful IoT big data for various applications and to combine IoT with machine learning and deep learning to process a large amount of useful data. However, in the centralized deep learning method, privacy issues have been raised because the server can use personal data collected from the user’s IoT. Due to this reason, Federated Learning (FL) method that can protect users' personal data while doing machine learning has been studied. However, current FL also has the possibility of data poisoning attacks and other problems. Therefore, this work, by suggesting distributed FL framework combined with Interplanetary File System and Differential Privacy, proposes a method that allows users to participate in FL safely and efficiently. Through this method, participants share some parts of data, and these data are collected by specific nodes. These data are combined to make a new dataset of FL network for defending against data poisoning attack and vouch for training’s accuracy. Also, an aggregation mechanism is proposed to suppress the effect of a malicious node poisoning attack. Finally, this framework is tested in python environment. With this method, one can freely open a project and anyone can join in with distributed condition, even when he or she has no enough dataset for learning but computing capability, vice versa. If a malicious node tries to interrupt the learning with poisoned dataset, aggregation mechanism and combined validation set from the network’s nodes will suppress the bad effect. We have tested through python and open-source code to verify the efficiency and privacy."", 'In the era of big data, how to balance model training with privacy of users’ data presents as a difficult problem. We present Federated Learning at Scale: A Systematization of Existing Work and a Blueprint for Future Research, which enables large-scale collaborative deep learning across many clients without centralizing data. Unlike standard machine learning methods, which aggregate raw data in one location, our federated approach ensures that client data resides on the corresponding devices. Through FedAvg, rather than sharing sensitive data, model updates are shared and aggregated by a central server. The proposed architecture involves necessary privacy aware techniques like isolated local training, secure communication protocol, and compatibility with Differential Privacy (DP) and Secure Aggregation (SA) algorithms. We evaluate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach on the MNIST dataset, with 5 simulated clients. Results from ten rounds of communication demonstrate the effectiveness of the DEGRA model and show that accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score improve significantly (from 66.43% to 96.42%), and the model can achieve a performance comparable to that of centralized training in a decentralized and privacy-conscious manner. This model is designed for edge scalability, resilient to data heterogeneity and low communication overhead, making it especially suitable for deployment in real applications, for example, mobile health, banking and IoT systems. The architecture itself is lightweight and flexible for easy scaling-up to more data and more complex non-IID data distributions. The proposed federated learning model can effectively tradeoff between performance and privacy and can support the construction of secure, scalable, and trustworthy AI systems. The code is available on the GitHub repository https://github.com/IndrasenaManga/FederatedLearning-at-Scale-A-Privacy-Preserving-Framework-for-Decentralized-AI-Training', 'Federated learning is a collaborative/distributed machine learning system which is designed to address the privacy issues in centralized machine learning systems. The transparency and provenance of a machine learning model are important aspects of federated learning systems since they impact peoples’ lives in various domains (e.g., from healthcare to personal finance to employment). However, most of the existing federated learning systems deal with centralized coordinators which are vulnerable to attacks and privacy breaches. Also, they do not provide any standard transparency and provenance mechanisms for the resulting models. In this paper, we propose a blockchain and Model Card-based integrated federated learning system ""Bassa-ML"" providing enhanced transparency and trust for the models. Model parameter sharing, local model generation, model averaging, and model sharing functions are implemented using smart contracts. The generated models, model training information, and model reports are stored in the blockchain ledger as Model Card Objects. This results in enhanced transparency and auditability to the federated learning process.']"

Here, we review the importance and application of digitalization in the agriculture and food sectors. The modernization of agriculture through technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, precision farming, and big data analytics has been emphasized. The integration of these techniques would significantly increase yield with minimal human interference, leading to environmental, social and economic sustainability. The adoption of digital technologies in agriculture allows for at least a 23% reduction in costs and a nearly 5% decrease in the volume of medium-level waste.

Similar to Ethereum smart contracts, EOSIO smart contracts have suffered from various vulnerability attacks, causing serious economic losses. Although some security analysis tools for EOSIO smart contracts have been proposed in the academic community, they still have some limitations, such as inadequate coverage of vulnerabilities and a lack of information about the triggered conditions and call stack when a vulnerability is identified. This makes it difficult for developers to utilize these tools. To address these problems, this paper proposes EOSVERIF, an automatic fine-grained analyzer of EOSIO smart contracts. It supports the concatenation of the set of vulnerabilities supported by all previous EOSIO security analysis tools and can provide the triggering conditions and execution paths of detected vulnerabilities. Our experimental results show that EOSVERIF can effectively detect vulnerabilities in EOSIO smart contracts.', ""Smart contracts with natural economic attributes have been widely and rapidly developed in various fields.

Nonetheless, existing smart contract vulnerability detection techniques are far away from enough: static analysis approaches rely heavily on manually crafted heuristics which is difficult to reuse across different types of vulnerabilities while deep learning based approaches also have unique limitations. In this study, we propose a novel approach, Peculiar, which uses Pre-training technique for detection of smart contract vulnerabilities based on crucial data flow graph. Compared against the traditional data flow graph which is already utilized in existing approach, crucial data flow graph is less complex and does not bring an unnecessarily deep hierarchy, which makes the model easy to focus on the critical features. Moreover, we also involve pre-training technique in our model due to the dramatic improvements it has achieved on a variety of NLP tasks.

During initialization, buffer node area, divided into node in the process of consensus dynamic add delete; As you progress through the consensus process, calculation with the involvement of consensus node number, in order to calculate its involvement; Finally, the nodes were dynamically replaced according to the level of involvement. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional PBFT algorithm, IBFT algorithm in the time delay are lower, in the process of consensus a greater throughput.', 'The Hyperledge Fabric permissioned consortium chain based on the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), the interference of the dishonest node as the primary node to the consensus process caused the performance problems in the application of the supply chain. To solve this problem, a consensus performance optimisation method that integrates Support Vector Machine (SVM) and PBFT is proposed in this research. Firstly, SVM is used to evaluate the trust of consensus nodes in blockchain network. By selecting a consensus node with a high degree of trust as the primary node to reduce the possibility of dishonest nodes as the primary node. Then, introduce a dynamic adjustment credit incentive mechanism to the blockchain network by reducing the consensus trust of malicious nodes and inactive nodes in the blockchain, which will improve the security of the supply chain system. Finally, the experimental results show that, comparing with the existing methods, the consensus node trust evaluation and credit incentive mechanism have improved the throughput and latency of the supply chain blockchain application.', 'Blockchain, as an emerging technology, has gained widespread research in academia and industry due to its decentralization and traceability. As an important form of blockchain, consortium chains are often applied in the Internet of Things (IoT) to ensure the authenticity and reliability of data. Within consortium chains, the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) method is a key technology for ensuring the data consistency. It plays a central role in enhancing the system performance, security, and scalability. However, with the increase in the number of user nodes and the diversification of application scenarios, PBFT faces significant challenges in maintaining performance and security, particularly due to the increased communication overhead, longer consensus latency (CL), and risks of malicious attacks on the leader node. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a new blockchain consensus mechanism, namely the reputation awareness randomization consensus mechanism in the blockchain systems (RARCs). This mechanism first builds an evaluation model for the nodes, dividing them into ordinary nodes and candidate nodes through the reputation assessment. Second, it constructs a consensus node selection strategy to select the high-quality consensus nodes from the candidate nodes. Finally, RARC establishes a leader node randomization selection mechanism, increasing the unpredictability of the leader node and reducing the probability of the malicious attacks. Through the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the RARC can significantly reduce the CL, enhance the throughput, and increase the unpredictability of the leader node, thereby improving the performance and security of the blockchain systems.']"

Privacy protection in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is the core factor to improve user and vehicle participation. This article proposes a novel blockchain-based dynamic extensible privacy protection and message authentication scheme for VANETs. It minimizes the computation cost of message authentication based on an elliptic curve and message batch verification. Based on the Chinese remainder theorem, this scheme protects transmitted message security by adaptively and dynamically responding to vehicles and roadside units accessing the VANET. It offers a smart contract-based forensics and tracing solution from the accident vehicle. In addition, strict security proof and analysis that the scheme meets the security requirements for the VANET. It evaluates the efficiency of the scheme, and the results show its practicality.', 'The proliferation of intelligent transportation technology has led to an increased frequency of communication between vehicles. However, the openness of the Internet of Vehicles and wireless communication has introduced substantial privacy and security concerns, necessitating the adoption of identity authentication technology to ensure secure vehicle-to-vehicle communication. In response to the challenges posed by single point of failure and high computational costs in traditional centralized identity authentication schemes, this study proposes a blockchain-based batch authentication scheme for the Internet of Vehicles BBASV. By leveraging a non-pairing certificateless mechanism, the BBASV scheme effectively addresses these limitations, reducing the computational complexity and network traffic in the authentication process, thereby enabling efficient batch authentication. Additionally, identity-based prefix-key encryption is utilized to preserve the privacy of vehicle identities during proxy vehicle broadcasting. Moreover, the proxy vehicle leverages signature fusion technology to perform batch authentication on neighboring vehicles, alleviating the authentication burden on roadside units. The effectiveness of the BBASV scheme is rigorously evaluated through theoretical analysis and empirical experimentation, demonstrating its resilience against various security threats, including DoS attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and simulated attacks. Furthermore, the scheme exhibits favorable attributes such as low computational requirements and network traffic, rendering it a promising solution for ensuring secure and privacy-preserving communication within the Internet of Vehicles domain.', 'The vehicles in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can be used to opportunistically gather and distribute the data in a smart city environment. However, at the same time, various security threats arise due to insecure communication happening among various entities in an IoV-based smart city deployment. To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves superior security and functionality features, and offers comparable storage, communication and computational costs as compared to other existing competing schemes. Finally, the blockchain implementation has been carried out on the proposed scheme to show its effectiveness.']"
