As a research hotspot in the field of intelligent transportation, the short-term traffic flow prediction is of great significance to traffic diversion and route planning. In the recent big data era, the machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to mining deep information in the data. However, the performance of a single ML model is usually not good. The ensemble learning can improve accuracy in most cases. In this paper, we propose a new short-term traffic flow prediction model. This paper regards the traffic prediction problem as a regression prediction problem, rather than a time series forecasting problem. The proposed model combines the prediction results of the XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost models through the ensemble machine learning strategy. With the experiments on real traffic data in Xi'an city, this paper has obtained the comparison of predictive performance of the models. Compared with single models such as the ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost models, the results show the proposed model is more accurate and more suitable for short-time traffic status prediction.",2021-05-14,2025-10-16 11:40:17,2025-10-16 11:40:17,,333-338,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE 10th Data Driven Control and Learning Systems Conference (DDCLS),,,,CatBoost; ensemble learning; LightGBM; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Time series analysis; traffic prediction; Transportation; Urban areas; XGBoost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 IEEE 10th Data Driven Control and Learning Systems Conference (DDCLS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the data query is technically straightforward, obtaining this dataset requires particular permission to protect customers’ privacy. Additionally, the dataset has large volumes of data (i.e, up to 300GB per day), resulting in not many researchers holding this data source to analyze the mobility of people. In this work, we collaborate with one of the biggest telecommunication service providers in Indonesia to collect MPD and prepare the big data infrastructure. We thus analyze mobility patterns during the early phase of COVID-19 in 2020 using actual Mobile Positioning Data in five provinces in Java. We use three metrics, namely, the number of visits, averaged travel distance, and Origin-Destination matrix. The findings indicate that the social restriction in the corresponding provinces has reduced the average traveled distance of the people, but not their number of visits. That is, while the traveled distance has declined more than eight times compared to the baseline, the number of visits may rocket up, up to nine times. It indicates that people are still having shorter trips even though their regular activities (working, schooling, etc.) have been restricted. The data also show that during Ramadhan month, the government has a successful intervention in restricting people for mudik Lebaran, The number of visits dropped to below 30 visits during Ramadhan and only small spikes exist during ‘libur lebaran’.",2022-10-18,2025-10-16 11:40:17,2025-10-16 11:40:17,,1-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2022 14th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ICITEE),,,,big data; Government; Java; Measurement; mobility; pandemic; Pandemics; Poles and towers; positioning; Rockets; Soft sensors; visualization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022 14th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ICITEE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telecommunication operators and companies always care to identify the Hotspots in the city. The hotspots are the places with very high communication strength relative to others. It is evident from the current literature that cyber physics social systems (CPSS) are useful in the identification of hotspots in a smart city. However, big data storage, analysis, processing, accuracy, and robustness are the key concerns. Thus herein, we propose a smart cyber-physical-social system for the analysis of hotspots using telecom data. Herein, our proposed CPS model is comprised of three layers and each layer has different functionality. In our proposed model, initially, raw Call Detail Data (CDR) data is collected at the data collection layer. Then smart CPSS passed it to the next layer. In the Data processing layer, CPSS performs pre-processing, data storage, and analysis. Then, it constructs a graph and performs a social network analysis (SNA). Herein, different from traditional centrality measures, we suggest Eigenvector and k-shell as social network similarity and Jaccard, cosine, as social behavioral measures. Herein, the process of city hotspot identification is performed, followed by SNA, which is conducted by quantifying the importance of each hotspot based on metrics. Finally, our proposed smart CPSS model accurately identifies Top-Ten hotspots. In this study, we use five-day data and compare the changes in the hotspot patterns. We validate our findings of hotspots with the original dataset and confirm the robustness and accuracy using autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions.",2024,2025-10-16 11:40:17,2025-10-16 11:40:17,,60556-60567,,,12,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Analytical models; big data; Big Data; Communications technology; Cyber-physical social systems (CPSS); Cyber-physical systems; cyber-physical systems (CPS); Data models; Measurement; Smart cities; smart city; Social factors; Social network theory; Telecommunications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential of sport as a catalyst for the advancement of smart cities is vast and multi-faceted: technological integrations related to sports in urban environments can significantly enhance public health, community engagement, and environmental sustainability. The paper emphasizes innovative practices and proposes a framework for evaluating the maturity of smart cities, incorporating sports facilities and technology. To analyze and categorize initiatives in sports and smart cities, we propose a framework grounded in nine functional domains of smart cities and five core technologies pertinent to sports and innovation. Sport holds considerable potential to propel smart city applications across various sectors. Furthermore, sports and smart cities share common technological enablers, such as sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent materials, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence, fostering converging into an integrated ecosystem. By applying a straightforward classification of projects, akin to the Software Capability Maturity Model, our objective is to provide a preliminary model for assessing the “distance” from the optimal utilization of sport within the various functional domains.

As a worldwide emergency response, governments have implemented various measures and policies, such as self-quarantine, travel restrictions, work from home, and regional lockdown, to control the spread of the epidemic. These countermeasures seek to restrict human mobility because COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that is spread by human-to-human transmission. Medical experts and policymakers have expressed the urgency to effectively evaluate the outcome of human restriction policies with the aid of big data and information technology. Thus, based on big human mobility data and city POI data, an interactive visual analytics system called Epidemic Mobility (EpiMob) was designed in this study. The system interactively simulates the changes in human mobility and infection status in response to the implementation of a certain restriction policy or a combination of policies (e.g., regional lockdown, telecommuting, screening). Users can conveniently designate the spatial and temporal ranges for different mobility restriction policies. Then, the results reflecting the infection situation under different policies are dynamically displayed and can be flexibly compared and analyzed in depth. Multiple case studies consisting of interviews with domain experts were conducted in the largest metropolitan area of Japan (i.e., Greater Tokyo Area) to demonstrate that the system can provide insight into the effects of different human mobility restriction policies for epidemic control, through measurements and comparisons.",2023-08-01,2025-10-16 11:40:17,2025-10-16 11:40:17,,3586-3601,,8,29,,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Analytical models; big trajectory data; COVID-19; Data models; epidemic control; Epidemics; Human mobility simulation; interactive system; Trajectory; Urban areas; visual analytics; Visual analytics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, requiring a 70 percent increase in global food production. Traditional agricultural practices are becoming increasingly inefficient and unreliable because of several issues, including soil degradation, water stress, nutrition shortage, insufficient infrastructure linkages, post-harvest loss, and information asymmetry. However, detrimental climate change is one of the most severe concerns confronting this industry. Thus, smart farming or digital agriculture is now regarded as a far more sustainable practice as it includes the management of farms via edge cutting technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones, big data etc. to maximize the quantity and quality of crops while minimizing the abundance of human work needed. It entails using sensors and automated irrigation procedures to monitor agricultural land, temperature, soil moisture, pH level, etc. Employing these technologies increases profitability, decreases waste, and preserves environmental quality. Although the smart agriculture business is expanding rapidly due to the world’s growing population and rising food consumption, this field still has a scope of academic literature. This paper aims to describe the different cutting-edge technologies currently being used in smart farming, their use cases, and their future directions. For this paper, a case study technique has been employed to study several technologies and their prospects in this endeavor. This study will be helpful to academicians and Government officials that can further help farmers to create a smart and more sustainable agriculture industry.",2023-03-23,2025-10-16 11:40:17,2025-10-16 11:40:17,,1096-1101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2023 International Conference on Sustainable Computing and Data Communication Systems (ICSCDS),,,,Agriculture; Artificial Intelligence; automation; Climate change; Farming; Internet of Things; Robot sensing systems; Robotics; Service robots; Smart agriculture; Social factors; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023 International Conference on Sustainable Computing and Data Communication Systems (ICSCDS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to cope with the performance and density request, the power consumption of CPU and GPU chips has significantly increased year by year, resulting in huge thermal design challenges with traditional air-cooling solution. For example, Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (codenamed Ice Lake) is up to 270W and TDP of Nvidia A100 GPU is up to 500W. This is almost beyond the cooling capability of traditional air-cooling solution under current thermal boundary condition due to limitation of heatsink size and air flow. In addition, Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is playing an increasingly key role on newly built data centers and has become mandatory requirement in government regulations. Under these circumstances, advanced cooling solution is urgently requested. Liquid cooling solution is an efficient solution to tackle the increasing power density in the data centers and becomes increasingly popular in modern data centers due to its excellent cooling capability, energy efficiency and PUE. This paper introduces the engineering practice of cold plate liquid cooling solution for hyper-scale data center application adopted by Volcano Engine, the cloud service platform under ByteDance.COM, covering the architecture and design from facility, server to components. This paper also includes the design and optimization of cold plate as well as other ingredients as coolant distribution unit(CDU), manifold, cold plate, tube, liquid leakage detection methodology. The thermal performance and power consumption are also analyzed and compared with air cooled system. The quality and reliability results are summarized based on more than six months of functional testing with over one thousand of pilot deployment servers powered with Ice Lake processors under cold plate liquid cooling solution in data center.",2023-06-30,2025-10-16 11:40:17,2025-10-16 11:40:17,,1-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2023 22nd IEEE Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems (ITherm),,,,Cloud computing; Cloud Computing and PUE; Cold Plate; Cold plates; Data Center; Data centers; Graphics processing units; Lakes; Liquid cooling; Liquid Cooling; Power demand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023 22nd IEEE Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems (ITherm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data center's thermal cooling strategy has been evolving in the past years and most traditional data centers still adopts air cooling solution for IT equipment's' cooling and dissipates the waste heat to environment directly. However, air cooling solution has almost reached the bottleneck to cool high power of CPU and GPU and also consumes substantial portion of total data center's power budget, which hurt both energy efficiency and operational expense (OpEx). As governments around the world have begun to request optimal Power Usage Effectiveness(PUE) for newly built large scale data centers, advanced liquid cooling solution is urgently being requested. One of the approaches is the immersion cooling solution with IT systems immersed in thermally conductive dielectric liquid, which has recently gained increasing attention from the industry to address the challenges in terms of thermal design and PUE requirement. However, due to lack of published validation result and long-term reliability statistics of immersion cooling solution, most data centers still hesitate to adopt this novel cooling technology. This paper introduces the best practice of single-phase immersion cooling solution applied by Volcano Engine, the cloud service platform under ByteDance.COM, including the architecture of immersion cooled data center, liquid tank, liquid candidates and server systems as well as thermal cooling performance, signal integrity impact, and results comparison with air cooled servers.

Most companies are implementing DT strategies, and the Global Pandemic may have accelerated the digitization of businesses. Concurrently, another set of trends focus on the need for improving the sustainability of business processes. It is now widely accepted the Earth cannot tolerate a continue, average increase in global temperatures at the rate it is currently experiencing. Governments committed to carbon emission goals have tighten environment regulations. Moreover, customers and even investors have shifted their mindset and sustainability related performance indicators are now part of the decision of doing business with a company or not. Lastly, an increasing number of business leaders are implementing principled leadership approaches, including social and environmental issues in their agenda. To make the matters worse, new technology developments like AI have the reputation of being power hungry requiring increasingly larges amount of energy to run. It is arguable DT may be further worsening the environmental crisis. As a sign of hope, there are multiple industry cases of the application of digital technologies, notably AI supported by BD, as enablers of sustainable business practices have emerged in recent years. The main objective of this research is to conduct an analysis of select industry examples investigate the potential of DT as an enabler of sustainable business processes instead of an additional cause of concern.

Most of the current cross-chain mechanisms based on blockchain are notary mode and relay mode, which cannot be dynamically switched according to their respective organizations' trust degree, making it difficult to meet the requirements of cross-chain data access between blockchain systems in complex trust environments. Based on this issue, a cross-chain consensus model based on trust establishment is proposed. The scheme constructs a blockchain security trust model based on the network state, blockchain system security, node data consistency and malicious node rate during blockchain operations, combines fuzzy theory and probability distributions to determine the trust components of each system, and uses those trust components and their weights to determine the system's trust value. The cross-chain consensus scheme is designed based on this model, which can be flexibly switched between the notary model and the committee relay model to satisfy cross-chain interconnection and mutual access between systems with different trust relationships.

Electronic records have enabled data processing, storage, and transfer to extend and accelerate this evolutionary effort. Electronic systems have been created to automate and record data from a process, for governments, organizations, and even for individuals. The expansion of these systems and the gradual increase of their complexity demanded the creation of Information Systems (IS) that aggregate data from several other systems to perform analysis and reports to support decision making, i.e., knowledge production (KP). The concept of Big Data - large volumes of data, with diverse structures, produced at an uncommon speed - describes the exponential growth of data production, but the same did not happen with the production of K. The objective of this work was to contribute to reduce this gap through the presentation of a reference model of IS to represent comprehensive and qualitatively measurable architectures in the KP. The method proposed in this work was the literature review about K, IS and reference models for information systems architecture (ISA), followed by the proposition of an IS reference model oriented to the conversion of data into knowledge (ISD2K) through a static and dynamic conceptual model. This proposition was validated from the description of a use case using ISD2K and elaboration of adherence questionnaires and evaluation of two IS in use at INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais). The model is based on a common usage language, describing six views or perspectives and nine representations to each view that allow to deliver an integrated representation from different points of view inside an organization of an IS where is possible to distinct data, information and knowledge and plan and qualify the KP data oriented.

The current research focuses on how to formulate policies and measure their implementation effects, providing important basis for optimizing strategies. Therefore, the joint term frequency inverse document frequency algorithm and potential Dirichlet allocation model are used to analyze policy texts, and the policy consistency index model is introduced to quantitatively evaluate the digital economy policies of the tourism industry. The research results showed that the keywords of tourism industry and platform, promotion service, technology and application appeared together more than 1000 times in policy texts. The depression indices corresponding to policy documents 1 to 8 were 2.944, 2.049, 2.252, 1.269, 2.045, 1.667, 2.142, and 4.118, respectively, with an average depression index of 2.311. In the proportion of depression index results, the policy effect had the highest proportion of 0.5, indicating that it was the most important, while policy guarantee and policy field importance were second, both corresponding to 0.4.

As a result, there has been a lot of study done in the important field of artificial intelligence (AI) and crime prediction. With the use of big data, machine learning, and predictive analytics, AI-based crime detection and prediction systems have developed quickly to improve public safety. These technologies, which work together to prevent and lessen criminal activity, include facial recognition, geographical analysis, behavioral analysis, natural language processing, and predictive policing. But the use of these AI tools presents important ethical issues that need to be resolved. Since algorithms trained on skewed data have the potential to disproportionately target minority communities, bias and fairness are important concerns. The massive data collection and surveillance required for these systems to operate well give rise to privacy concerns. Considering that AI decision-making processes are frequently opaque, transparency and accountability are also issues. Furthermore, the absence of informed permission and the possible abuse of technology for repressive or political purposes. Technology improvements must be balanced with ethical considerations, and this can be achieved through the implementation of policies, procedures, public involvement, oversight, and ongoing review. To ensure ethical use, it can be helpful to develop algorithms that are conscious of fairness, to set clear regulations, to involve communities in the deployment of AI, and to create independent oversight agencies. Sustaining AI systems’ efficacy and equity requires regular evaluation of their impact and performance. It is conceivable to maximize the advantages of AI in crime detection while preserving individual rights and public confidence by giving these ethical principles top priority",2024-11-06,2025-10-16 11:40:18,2025-10-16 11:40:18,,1557-1562,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2024 8th International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)",,,,AI Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Bias Mitigation; Ethics; Face recognition; Facial Recognition; Law enforcement; Natural language processing; Predictive Policing; Privacy Concerns; Public security; Regulation; Reviews; Security; Surveillance; Transparency and Accountability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2024 8th International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the goal of this research is to find an appropriate prediction model for exchange rate volatility. This study employs a decomposition-based Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) ensemble model. This model collects data through decomposition and then models it with BPNN to provide a single network prediction. Each IMF uses the same parameters: a 4-4-1 input-hidden-output neuron network architecture, sigmoid and identity activation functions, a learning rate of 0.1, and the Flecher-Reeves network training function. To avoid overfitting caused by repeated parameter selection attempts, the same parameters are employed. Furthermore, predictors are chosen using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) approaches, and Ensemble BPNN is performed based on the predictor findings. The currency rate data utilized is from the last two years (2021–2023), with a big data spread (469.46), indicating strong volatility. The EMD decomposition approach includes 6 IMF and EEMD 7 IMF.

EU4AUG3L,conferencePaper,2022,M. C; C. H,A Novel Approach for Parallelized Clustering Model by Using Hadoop Map-Reduce Framework,"2022 IEEE International Conference for Women in Innovation, Technology & Entrepreneurship (ICWITE)",,,10.1109/ICWITE57052.2022.10176209,,"The current generation of cellular devices have plenty of processing power and storage, but they lag behind in terms of huge data storage and processing software. ""Big Data"" is referred to huge volumes of unstructured data generated by high-performance applications from scientific computers to social networks, e-government to medical information systems, and so on. According to recent big data study, the amount of data continues to grow at an exponential rate. A strong computing paradigm like Hadoop and Map-Reduce is required to process enormous amounts of data on computing clusters. The Map-Reduce framework is a programming technique that allows you to handle terabytes of data in a fraction of the time. Big data needs good scheduling in order to attain outstanding results. The Scheduling Technique is used to decrease hunger, enhance resource utilisation, and distribute work to available resources.For the Hadoop Map-Reduce model, various scheduling algorithm has been developed, which differs widely in design, behavior, and handling various issues. Existing resource allocation scheduling do not consider the weight of each job which leads to unbalanced performance among nodes. We focus on several issues of Hadoop Map reduce and introduce novel mechanism to handle and process the Big data. The proposed approach is divided into three phases such as implementation of optimized clustering scheme, improving the clustering scheme by implementation them in parallel manner and finally, incorporating machine learning and Fuzzy logic based intelligent techniques to adapt the big data changes to efficiently process the huge data.In first phase, we develop improved P-DBSCAN algorithm which uses Mapper and reducer programs in such a way so that input data points will get into the cluster formulation. The proposed approach consists of several stages such as data partitioning stage, local clustering stage, data merger stage and global cluster generation stage as final outcome. Moreover, two cluster optimization methods are included to improve the clustering performance. DBSCAN parallelization options are examined using the Spark platform built to maximize memory consumption and iterative processes. Single-node Spark and Spark cluster platforms have historically used distinct resource managers for DBSCAN optimization.In second stage, we adopt the concept of Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm and developed a novel clustering scheme to overcome the issues of DBSCAN. This scheme uses mapper and reducer entities. Mapper receives its copy of the input dataset. Labeling activities are carried out by the Mapper, such as finding the closest centroid to an individual data object. The reducer creates a new value for each centroid based on the items allocated to it in the current iteration of the algorithm. This is determined by evaluating the average of all of the data objects in each cluster. Later, K-Medoid method proposed utilizing medoids as the center of clusters since they can be influenced by outliers, although this is a disadvantage. It aims to reduce the cost between the cluster's non-medoids and its medoid.Finally, we focus on semantic relationship extraction between queries where we adopted neuro-fuzzy based hybrid technique and TF-IDF algorithm. In this thesis, we developed a hybrid approach by using Fuzzy logic and neural network to mine high fuzzy utility patterns. New fuzzy rules are defined based on 6 different criteria such as Query Time, Query Length, Query Expiry, Total Queries, CPU Usages, and Task activity. First of all, we perform the data pre-processing where several tasks are performed to filter the data, later, these queries are processed through the scheduler where fuzzy rule based is used and semantic relationship is established among queries. Based on the TF-IDF approach weight are computed from filtered data. The average runtime performance of these schemes is obtained as 167.5s, 137.5s, 51.25s, 37.5s, and 25s by using Apriori (M), HFUPM, Apriori, and EFUPM, Proposed Approach, respectively.",2022-12-01,2025-10-16 11:40:18,2025-10-16 11:40:18,,1-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2022 IEEE International Conference for Women in Innovation, Technology & Entrepreneurship (ICWITE)",,,,Big Data & 5G Communications; Cloud; Data Clustering; Distributed Computing; Hadoop; Parallel Algorithms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2022 IEEE International Conference for Women in Innovation, Technology & Entrepreneurship (ICWITE)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tantawy,Keynote Speech 5: Building an Ecosystem for Innovation that Matters,2021 31st International Conference on Computer Theory and Applications (ICCTA),2770-6575,,10.1109/ICCTA54562.2021.9916596,,"It is through innovation that nations evolve and economies grow. Naturally, every nation has its own demographic profile, social structures, natural resources, economic sectors dynamics, laws, traditions, etc. Innovation should take into consideration the specific characteristics of a society in order to effectively help its industry build useful products and its businesses (and government) provide life-enhancing services. It is therefore imperative for a nation to ensure that its domestic Research & Development organizations put appropriate focus on the development of the novel technologies and new business models that would most efficiently enable it to achieve its ambitious national objectives. In Egypt, several attempts to apply this simple principle have been made through the years. Not all institutions have succeeded in delivering the results that they were originally established to achieve. This presentation analyzes this dilemma, especially the notoriously difficult problem of ensuring the efficient collaboration among academia, industry, and government. A recent initiative geared towards tackling this challenge is examined in this presentation. The mission of the Applied Innovation Center at the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology is to explore and promote the use of emerging Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in analyzing and solving national challenges, while developing human capital and creating an environment for innovative enterprises to form and succeed. The Center uses the most appropriate technologies to develop and pilot innovative solutions in key application domains, such as Healthcare, Agriculture, Digital Transformation, and others. At the same time, the Center uses project settings to train and develop the skills of ICT professionals in advanced technical areas, such as AI, Big Data Analytics, High Performance Computing, Automation and Robotics, Internet of Things, Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, etc. The lessons learned from this experience is discussed.",2021-12-11,2025-10-16 11:40:18,2025-10-16 11:40:18,,5-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2021 31st International Conference on Computer Theory and Applications (ICCTA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 31st International Conference on Computer Theory and Applications (ICCTA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyberspace is actually the combinational outcome of various technologies including computers, communications, materials, intelligence and studies in perception, cognition, biology, sociology, etc., as well as advanced computing like the Internet/Web, pervasive networks, ubiquitous sensing and computing, the internet of things, the cloud, big data and so forth. These smart worlds are set to be the next important stage in human history. We have to be aware of the essential problems and crucial issues affecting in building truly smart worlds that benefit humanity, and simultaneously safeguard the natural environment for sustainable development and evolution.

9S2YGSBM,conferencePaper,2017,,Keynote speakers: Cyber-human partnerships — Towards a resilient ecosystem in smart cities,2017 40th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP),,,10.1109/TSP.2017.8075923,,"In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such validations span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of Dny for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems. This lecture introduces the FC fundamental concepts and presents several applications in distinct areas of science and engineering.",2017-07-05,2025-10-16 11:40:18,2025-10-16 11:40:18,,xi-xiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2017 40th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 40th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an earlier paper [Tien 2015], the author defined the concept of a servgood, which can be thought of as a physical good or product enveloped by a services-oriented layer that makes the good smarter or more adaptable and customizable for a particular use. Adding another layer of physical sensors could then enhance its smartness and intelligence, especially if it were to be connected with each other or with other servgoods through the Internet of Things. Such sensed servgoods are becoming the products of the future. Indeed, autonomous vehicles can be considered the exemplar servgoods of the future; it is about decision informatics and embraces the advanced technologies of sensing (i.e., Big Data), processing (i.e., real-time analytics), reacting (i.e., real-time decision-making), and learning (i.e., deep learning). Since autonomous vehicles constitute a huge quality-of-life disruption, it is also critical to consider its policy impact on privacy and security, regulations and standards, and liability and insurance. Finally, just as the Soviet Union inaugurated the space age on October 4, 1957, with the launch of Sputnik, the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the U. S. has inaugurated an age of automata or autonomous vehicles that can be considered to be the U. S. Sputnik of servgoods, with the full support of the U. S. government, the U. S. auto industry, the U. S. electronic industry, and the U.S. higher educational enterprise.",2016-06-24,2025-10-16 11:40:18,2025-10-16 11:40:18,,1-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2016 13th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management (ICSSSM),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016 13th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management (ICSSSM),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Processing large amounts of data is increasingly considered as conditio sine qua non for policy making by governments and decision making by individuals or enterprises. Open data is published on the Web in many heterogeneous formats. New paradigms on data representation and applications development should not multiply the competing approaches for big data, but rather build on previous work and align the divergent approaches together through use of links and semantic relations. The benefits of the proposed approach based on linked data become apparent in tasks requiring combination of datasets from multiple sources. The absence of links and explicit semantics forms a barrier to automated processing, combining, and joining datasets of distinct origin. In context of such tasks, applying linked data and semantic web technologies offers greater data",2016-10-20,2025-10-16 11:40:18,2025-10-16 11:40:18,,xiii-xiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2016 11th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMAP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016 11th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMAP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has raised unique security, privacy, and trust challenges to the adopters of IoT. The heterogeneous nature of the IoT devices as well as the computational constraints makes security, privacy, and trust an extremely challenging problem to solve. Nonetheless, security, privacy, and trust play a critical role for most, if not all, applications of IoT in domains such as surveillance, healthcare, security, transport, food safety, manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain management.

YBBE6W58,journalArticle,2018,D. Zheng; A. Wu; Y. Zhang; Q. Zhao,Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Medical Data Sharing in Internet of Things With Limited Computing Power,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2840504,,"With the application of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in smart city, intelligent medical terminals play a more and more significant role in our daily life. These terminals can monitor our physical conditions and get lots of medical data in time. For the sake of data security and practicality, the collected big data can be encrypted and then stored on a cloud server such that only authorized users, such as the data owner and the doctors, can access. However, smart terminals are usually limited in computing power and users' privacy issues remain. To tackle this challenging problem, an efficient medical data sharing scheme is presented in this paper. To solve the privacy issues in users' data sharing, we utilize attribute-based encryption to enable data sharing. In addition, we remove the attribute matching function and use the attribute bloom filter to hide all the attributes in the access control structure. In order to improve the efficiency of encryption, we introduce the online/offline encryption technology in the encryption phase. Before the message is known, a large amount of work that is needed at the encryption stage will be done. Then, once the message is known, the ciphertext can be generated quickly.

Shoji,A Neighbor-Based Probabilistic Broadcast Protocol for Data Dissemination in Mobile IoT Networks,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2808356,,"The recent trend of implementing Internet of Things (IoT) applications is to transmit sensing data to a powerful data center and try to discover the valuable knowledge behind “Big Data”by various intelligent but resource-consuming algorithms. However, from the discussion with some industrial companies, it is understood that disseminating real-time sensing data to their nearby network-edge applications directly would produce a more economical design and lower service latency for some important smart city applications. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient broadcast protocol to disseminate data in mobile IoT networks. The proposed protocol exploits the neighbor knowledge of mobile nodes to determine a rebroadcast delay that prioritizes different packet broadcasts according to their profits. An adaptive connectivity factor is also introduced to make the proposed protocol adaptive to the node density of different network parts. By combining the neighbor knowledge of nodes and adaptive connectivity factor, a reasonable probability is calculated to determine whether a packet should be rebroadcasted to other nodes or be discarded to prevent redundant packet broadcast. Extensive simulation results have validated that this protocol can improve the success ratio of packet delivery by 13% ~ 28% with a similar end-to-end transmission delay and network overhead of the most state-of-art approaches.",2018,2025-10-16 11:40:28,2025-10-16 11:40:28,,12260-12268,,,6,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Delays; Internet of Things; mobile networks; neighbor coverage; Network topology; probabilistic broadcast; Probabilistic logic; Protocols; Sensors; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address the potential very large scale of such datasets, we map the problem of data clustering to a community detection one. Datasets are cast in the form of graphs, representing the relations among individual observations and data clustering is mapped to node clustering (community detection) in the data graph. We propose a novel computational approach for enhancing the traditional Girvan-Newman (GN) community detection algorithm via hyperbolic network embedding. The data dependency graph is embedded in the hyperbolic space via Rigel embedding, making it possible to compute more efficiently the hyperbolic edge-betweenness centrality (HEBC) needed in the modified GN algorithm. This allows for more efficient clustering of the nodes of the data graph without significantly sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with artificial network and data topologies, and real benchmark datasets. The proposed methodology can be used for efficient clustering of datasets obtained from massive pervasive smart city/building sensor networks, such as the FIESTA-IoT platform, and exploited in various applications such as lower-cost sensing.",2018-03-19,2025-10-16 11:40:28,2025-10-16 11:40:28,,266-271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops),,,,Clustering algorithms; Community detection; Data analysis; Data clustering; Detection algorithms; Edge-betweenness centrality; Girvan-Newman algorithm; Hyperbolic network embedding; Image edge detection; Measurement; Rigel embedding; Sensors; Smart cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, these devices will generate massive amounts of valuable data at the network edge, calling for not only instant data processing but also intelligent data analysis in order to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. Both the traditional cloud computing and on-device computing cannot sufficiently address this problem due to the high latency and the limited computation capacity, respectively. Fortunately, the emerging edge computing sheds a light on the issue by pushing the data processing from the remote network core to the local network edge, remarkably reducing the latency and improving the efficiency. Besides, the recent breakthroughs in deep learning have greatly facilitated the data processing capacity, enabling a thrilling development of novel applications, such as video surveillance and autonomous driving. The convergence of edge computing and deep learning is believed to bring new possibilities to both interdisciplinary researches and industrial applications. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest efforts on the deep-learning-enabled edge computing applications and particularly offer insights on how to leverage the deep learning advances to facilitate edge applications from four domains, i.e., smart multimedia, smart transportation, smart city, and smart industry.

However, it also brings the new security threats, especially data security threats during data access that leads to unauthorized/unauthorized access, alteration and disclosure of data, affecting the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Therefore, access control, as an important method to ensure the security of user data during data access, began to be applied to mobile edge computing. However, the existing access control has the disadvantages of coarse-grain, poor flexibility and accuracy, lack of internal attack considerations, etc., which cannot meet the needs of data security in practical applications of mobile edge computing. In this paper, a data security enhanced Fine-Grained Access Control mechanism (FGAC) is proposed to ensure data security during data access in mobile edge computing. In FGAC, a dynamic fine-grained trusted user grouping scheme based on attributes and metagraphs theory was first designed. Secondly, the scheme was combined with the traditional role-based access control mechanism to assign roles to users based on user group credibility. And then, based on attribute matching the user authentication further verifies whether the user is allowed to perform the access operations to achieve fine-grained data protection. Experimental results show that FGAC can effectively identify malicious users and make group adjustments, while achieving fine-grained access control and assure the data security during the data access process in mobile edge computing.",2020,2025-10-16 11:40:28,2025-10-16 11:40:28,,136119-136130,,,8,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,access control; Access control; Cloud computing; Data centers; data confidentiality; data integrity; data security; Data security; Edge computing; metagraph theory; Mobile edge computing; Servers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the development of recommendation engine and the popularity of social media network, people are more and more used to relying on personalized Points-of-Interest (POI) recommendations. However, traditional approaches can fail if users moves to a region where they had little or no active history or even social network friends information before. Under the requirement of smart city construction, the need to give high quality personalized POI recommendation when a user travels to a new region has arisen. Fortunately, with the widespread of wireless Internet, the booming of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and the common-usage of location sensors in mobile phones, the coupling degree between social media networks and location information is ever increasing, which could leads us to a new way to solve this problem in the ear of Big Data. In this research, we presented New Place Recommendation Algorithm (N-PRA) which is designed based on Latent Factor model. Many different types of social media contexts (time-related and location-related), such as a user’s interest fluctuation, different types of POIs’ popularity fluctuation, types of POIs, the influence of geographical neighborhood on POIs, and user’s social network friendship are taken into consideration in this approach. The algorithm presented is verified on Yelp, an open-source real urban data-set, and compared against several other baseline POI recommendation algorithms.

Huge advances are being made to develop smart city traffic using big data. Intelligent bus systems based on bus integrated circuit (IC) card systems are constantly developing and improving. Compared with traditional manual survey data, bus IC data is low-cost, real-time and accurate with a simple acquisition method. Bus IC data is an important basic data resource and data mining of bus IC cards can obtain dynamic information about urban bus passenger flow and help improve urban bus planning and service levels. The crucial factor in determining whether this data can be reasonably applied to the optimization of urban bus systems is whether spatial and temporal characteristics of the passenger bus trip can be obtained through bus IC data mining, and there is much current research interest into this topic. In this paper, the characteristics of one-day passenger flow and time-division passenger flow are analyzed based on data obtained from swiping IC cards for one week on a bus in Qingdao. Then, based on a GA-NARX neural network model, the passenger flow is forecast using the IC card swipe data for five working days of Qingdao No. 1 bus (using ten minutes as the time interval). The forecasting results show that the passenger flow can be successfully predicted using this method and thus this method can be used for short-term passenger flow forecasting using bus IC cards.",2020,2025-10-16 11:40:28,2025-10-16 11:40:28,,8812-8820,,,8,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bus IC card data; bus passenger flow characteristics; Data models; Forecasting; genetic algorithms; Integrated circuit modeling; neural network; Neural networks; Predictive models; Scheduling; short-term passenger flow forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current solutions are incapable to thoroughly solve the privacy issues on data pricing and guarantee the utility of statistic outputs. Therefore, this paper studies the problem of trading private statistic results for IoT data, by considering three factors. Specifically, a novel framework for trading range counting results is proposed. The framework applies a sampling-based method to generate approximated counting results, which are further perturbed for privacy concerns and then released. The results are theoretically proved to achieve unbiasedness, bounded variance, and strengthened privacy guarantee under differential privacy. Moreover, a pricing approach is proposed for the traded results, which is proved to be immune against arbitrage attacks. The framework is evaluated by estimating the air pollution levels with different ranges on 2014 CityPulse Smart City datasets. The analysis and evaluation results demonstrate that our framework greatly reduces the error of range counting approximation; and the optimal perturbation approach enables that the private counting satisfies the specified approximation degree while providing strong privacy guarantee.",2019-07-07,2025-10-16 11:40:28,2025-10-16 11:40:28,,144-153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE 39th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),,,,"Aggregates; Differential privacy; Differential Privacy, Range counting, Pricing; Internet of Things; Pricing; Privacy; Smart devices",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 IEEE 39th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper focuses on a migratable urban land usage classification problem using remote sensing data (i.e., satellite images). Our goal is to accurately classify the land usage of locations in a target city where the ground truth land usage data is not available by leveraging a classification model from a source city where such data is available. This problem is motivated by the limitation of current solutions that primarily rely on a rich set of ground-truth data for accurate model training, which encounters high annotation costs. Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: i) the target and source cities often have different urban characteristics that prevent the direct application of a model learned from the source city to the target city; ii) the complex visual features in satellite images make it non-trivial to “translate” the images from the target city to the source city for an accurate classification. To address the above challenges, we develop TransLand, an adversarial transfer learning framework to translate the satellite images from the target city to the source city for accurate land usage classification. We evaluate our scheme on the real-world satellite imagery and land usage datasets collected from live different cities in Europe. The results show that TransLand significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art land usage classification baselines in classifying the land usage of locations in a city.",2019-12-09,2025-10-16 11:40:28,2025-10-16 11:40:28,,1567-1576,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),,,,Computer architecture; Microprocessors; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sensors; Task analysis; Urban areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mobile computing takes full advantage of the computing power and communication capabilities of various sensing devices and uses these devices to form a computing cluster. When using such clusters for training of distributed machine learning models, the load imbalance and network transmission delay result in low efficiency of model training. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed machine learning parameter communication consistency model based on the parameter server idea, which is called the limited synchronous parallel model. The model is based on the fault-tolerant characteristics of the machine learning algorithm, and it dynamically limits the size of the synchronization barrier of the parameter server, reduces the synchronization communication overhead, and ensures the accuracy of the model training; thus, the model realizes finite asynchronous calculation between the worker nodes and gives full play to the overall performance of the cluster. The implementation of cluster dynamic load balancing experiments shows that the model can fully utilize the cluster performance during the training of distributed machine learning models to ensure the accuracy of the model and improve the training speed.",2019,2025-10-16 11:40:28,2025-10-16 11:40:28,,171884-171897,,,7,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Computational modeling; distributed machine learning; limited synchronous parallel model; Load modeling; Machine learning; Mobile computing; parameter server; Security; security monitoring; Servers; Synchronization; Training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapid advancements in computer vision techniques due to Deep Neural Networks enable using these camera feeds for performing non-trivial analytics. Tracking a moving object of interest using a large network of cameras, also known as object reidentification, is one such analytic that empowers city administration with capabilities such as finding missing people or prioritizing emergency vehicles. We have built Anveshak, a framework for distributed wide-area tracking. Anveshak fills in the shortcomings of existing Big Data and Deep Learning frameworks by - exposing an intuitive and composable programming model; automating application deployment and orchestration across edge, fog and cloud resources and providing knobs to the user for managing the application performance. The knobs lend the application the ability to scale potentially to thousands of cameras. In this proposal we have designed two representative applications; missing person tracking and priority signalling for emergency vehicles. We empirically verify that the application scales to 1000 cameras on a Cloud-only deployment of 10 Azure VMs with 8 cores and 32GB RAM each.

Machine Learning algorithms can support this challenge by generating virtual data via utilization of real data from a smaller subset of sensors. The generated data can replicate sensor behavior which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to track.

Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep  $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based feature selection algorithms achieve much better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, and are robust under data poisoning attacks.",2021-11-01,2025-10-16 11:40:28,2025-10-16 11:40:28,,16153-16164,,21,8,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Correlation; Deep Q-network (DQN); Feature extraction; feature selection; Internet of Things; Machine learning; multisourced data; Mutual information; reinforcement learning; Smart cities; Training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, most of the languages in the world are 'minority languages', in the sense that they are spoken by a small population and with limited resource accumulation. Since the present speech technologies are mostly based on big data, partly due to the profound impact of deep learning, they are not directly applicable to minority languages. However, minority languages are so numerous and important that if we want to break the language barrier, they must be seriously taken into account. Recently, the Chinese government approved a fundamental research for minority languages in China: Multilingual Minorlingual Automatic Speech Recognition (M2ASR).

Take mobile phones as an example. Due to their various sensors, high presence among people, and cost-effectiveness, they are becoming very popular. This has made it easy to obtain users' contextual data whose collection can be valuable in engineering and business domains, e.g., transportation, location-based services, and advertisement industry. The data volume generated by mobile phones and the need to analyze the information near the real-time are the challenges facing researchers. Recently, big data has attracted much attention from academia, industry as well as government. There is a strong need for new technologies, e.g., frameworks based on cloud computing, that could not only process and analyze a large volume of data, but also ingest a large volume of data at a fast pace. In this paper, we propose to use a dynamic data analysis framework to explore and analyze mobile phone data.

Therefore, inflation needs to be controlled. One of inflation control conducted by the government is predicting and calculating inflation using CPI indicators on a monthly. Prediction with monthly frequency, could be too late, because inflation has been a few days and it is not known quickly. With the development of internet technology today, various data sources related to inflation easily obtained in real-time. This data can be used for daily CPI prediction. Daily predictions allow policy makers to make better policies. CPI prediction using daily data will face challenges. The growing variants and data volumes need good computing systems. Cloud computing can be used to solve the problem. This is a preliminary research in developing daily CPI prediction model using big data and cloud computing. Here we focus on developing a daily CPI prediction model using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method in a cloud computing. For better accuracy, we compared the kernel functions of SVR and tuning SVR parameters using the grid search and Random Search method. In addition, we compared SVR with the Random Forest method. These daily CPI predictions are simulated into cloud computing environments. From this simulation we show computation time and accuration comparisons needed if run on personal computers with cloud computing. The results showed that SVR using RBF kernel has less mse value 0.3454 in monthly prediction and 0.0095 in daily predictions. And Random Forest result is slightly different than SVR - RBF, mse value 0.0171 in daily prediction.

The move towards this purpose is supported by government programs, development programs of regions and national economy sectors and a large number of other initiatives. Building a digital economy involves solving a number of problems, which have one common root cause - cardinal change of information communication technologies. In process of practical movement to new principles of management the contradiction between private and general approaches to their introduction becomes more acute. On the one hand, we can see financial growth of an increasing number of local tasks, the development of certain technologies, pilot projects and start-ups, and, on the other hand, insufficient attention to the development of an integrated systematic approach to the study of the digital economy as a holistic technological project that uses generalized information models and architecture. It's clear that without studying the properties of the digital economy as a large digital information system, it is impossible to form new markets and activity models in any of the application areas. The problem solved in the article is to resolve this contradiction. Goal of the work - the construction of an architectural model of a digital economy that unites the entire set of fundamental principles of its technological organization that are embodied in a set of digital technologies, the connections of technologies with each other and with the external environment. The following tasks are solved: the properties and attributes of the digital economy are analyzed,; precondition of the architectural description of the digital economy are identified,; a stratified architectural model of digital economy is developed. It is shown that the architectural model of the digital economy must contain infrastructure and subject-oriented levels. The first group includes physical laws and technologies for constructing real and virtual digital datal sources, networks and storing systems, data processing and distribution, as well as cloudy and foggy computing. The second - technologies for creating structures and data analysis, building digital platforms and applications, creating a digital platform ecosystem, digital markets and business processes models.

Existing monitoring methods are time-intensive and techniques such as tagging are also invasive and may adversely affect animals. Bioacoustics based monitoring is becoming an increasingly prominent non-invasive method, involving the passive recording of animal sounds. Bioacoustics analysis can provide deep insights into key environmental integrity issues such as biodiversity, density of individuals and present or absence of species. However, analysing environmental recordings is not a trivial task. In last decade several researchers have tried to apply machine learning methods to automatically extract insights from these recordings. To help current researchers and identify research gaps, this paper aims to summarise and classify these works in the form of a taxonomy of the various bioacoustics applications and analysis approaches. We also present a comprehensive survey of bioacoustics data analysis approaches with an emphasis on bird species identification. The survey first identifies common processing steps to analyse bioacoustics data. As bioacoustics monitoring has grown, so does the volume of raw acoustic data that must be processed. Accordingly, this survey examines how bioacoustics analysis techniques can be scaled to work with big data. We conclude with a review of open challenges in the bioacoustics domain, such as multiple species recognition, call interference and automatic selection of detectors.",2020,2025-10-16 11:40:28,2025-10-16 11:40:28,,57684-57708,,,8,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bioacoustics; biodiversity; Biodiversity; Biomedical acoustics; Birds; density estimation; features; Microphones; Monitoring; species identification; syllables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Common electronics are used in the design of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), targeting military, and civilian populations, while concealed recording devices steal proprietary/confidential data, compromising both government and industrial resources. This paper discusses a novel, nonintrusive, repeatable, reliable, expandable, and simple-to-implement detection and identification (D&I) system for identifying threats by using unintended radiated emissions (URE). This paper differs from current URE proposals, by avoiding energy radiation. The proposed process also addresses big data problems involved in capturing and building databases of URE characteristics. Issue interpretation is utilized with URE data to distinguish between threat/nonthreat devices using multiple criteria decision analysis and other decision-making techniques to determine model and mode of hidden devices. System optimization, verified by testing, is used to improve the speed and accuracy of the identification algorithm. The system is developed with data from 130 devices and validated with 33 separate devices, which are representative of IED and espionage threats. Due to slow progress in the URE D&I field, the properties and potential of a more effective D&I system, compared to current methods, will be of interest to the explosive ordnance disposal, security services, electronic systems manufacturing, automated inventory, mobile application development communities, and potentially others as well.

However, excessive fluctuations in the price would also bring adverse effects to corresponding industry. The price change of agricultural products was the great event vital to national well-being and the people's livelihood. Since the price of agricultural products was affected by many factors, it was difficult to predict the price of agricultural products timely and accurately. The emergence of cloud computing, accompanied by massive storage space, huge computing capacity and low cost, provided a new direction for data mining to deal with big data. To realize the short-term agricultural product price forecasting, took service oriented forecasting as the guidance, this paper constructed a agricultural product price forecasting service system based on the DOA architecture. The system could conduct the analysis and prediction for the market price through the combined forecasting method of wavelet transform and BP neural network. Based on the 72 sets of monthly price data from January 2013 to December 2018 of the spinach, cabbage, tomato, pepper and potato, this paper studied the changing trend of agricultural products price. Firstly, in this paper, the price was conducted the db5 three scale decomposition using wavelet transform. Then, the shredded trend part and detail part were predicted by BP neural network model respectively. Finally, the prediction results of each component were combined and reconstructed. On the basis of this combined forecasting method, the agricultural product price forecasting service system with functions of price data service and price forecasting service was designed based on DOA architecture. To verify the prediction accuracy to the price of the 5 kinds of vegetables, the prediction accuracy index was used to evaluate and analyze the price prediction results of the system. The results showed that the minimum mean absolute error of the system was 0.083 yuan/kg, the minimum mean percentage error was 3.95%, the minimum mean square error was 0.102 and the agricultural product price forecasting service system combining wavelet transform and BP neural network had better agricultural product price forecasting performance. At the same time, this also meant that the universality of this system could adapt to the price forecasting of a variety of vegetables and provide technical support for producers, operators, consumers and relevant government departments.",2020-10-19,2025-10-16 11:40:29,2025-10-16 11:40:29,,4-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE 13th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD),,,,Agricultural products; Analytical models; BP neural network; Cloud computing; Forecasting; Neural networks; Predictive models; Price forecasting service; Wavelet transform; Wavelet transforms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020 IEEE 13th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hou,PrivacyScope: Automatic Analysis of Private Data Leakage in TEE-Protected Applications,2020 IEEE 40th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),2575-8411,,10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00013,,"Big data analytics is having a profound impact on many sectors of the economy by transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. However, increased use of sensitive business and private personal data with no or limited privacy safeguards has raised great concerns among individuals and government regulators. To address the growing tension between the need for data utility and the demand for data privacy, trusted execution environment (TEE) is being used in academic research as well as industrial application as a powerful primitive to enable confidential computation on the private data with only the result disclosed but not the original private data. While much of the current research has been focusing on protecting the TEE against attacks (e.g. side-channel information leakage), the security and privacy of the applications executing inside a TEE enclave has received little attention. The general attitude is that the application is running inside a trusted computing base (TCB), and therefore can be trusted. This assumption may not be valid when it comes to unverified third-party applications. In this paper, we present PrivacyScope, a static code analyzer designed to detect leakage of private data by an application code running in a TEE. PrivacyScope accomplishes this by analyzing the application code and identifying violations of a property called nonreversibility. We introduce nonreversibility since the classical noninterference property falls short of detecting private data leakage in certain scenarios, e.g., in machine learning (ML) programs where the program output is always related to (private) input data. Given its strict reliance on observable state, the noninterference falls short of detecting private data leakage in these situations. By design, PrivacyScope detects both explicit and implicit information leakage. The nonreversibility property is formally defined based on the noninterference property. Additionally, we describe the algorithms for PrivacyScope as extensions to the runtime semantics of a general language. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach and proof-of-feasibility prototype, we apply PrivacyScope to detect data leakage in select open-source ML code modules including linear regression, k-means clustering and collaborative filtering. Also, PrivacyScope can detect intentional data leakage code injected by a programmer. We responsibly disclosed all the discovered vulnerabilities leading to disclosure of private data in the open-source ML program we analyzed.",2020-12-29,2025-10-16 11:40:29,2025-10-16 11:40:29,,34-44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE 40th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),,,,Data privacy; formal semantics; information flow analysis; intel sgx enclave; internet of things; machine learning; Machine learning; Open source software; privacy; Prototypes; Semantics; static analysis; symbolic execution; taint analysis; Tools; Trusted computing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020 IEEE 40th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is an urgent need for a more advanced integrated territorial space layout method. For additional spatial layout design, the study suggests a multi-objective genetic algorithm based on spatial data prediction and coupled with land simulation modeling in the context of big data and machine learning development. The innovation of the research lies in the optimization of the multi-objective genetic algorithm by improving the crossover and mutation process of genetic operators, enhancing the adaptability of the algorithm in dynamic environments, and improving the prediction accuracy of the spatial quantity structure of the national territory. The outcomes revealed that this approach was applied to the prediction of populations of different sizes 400 and 600 with an average accuracy of 67%, which was 17% higher than that of the traditional genetic algorithm. The difference between the predicted and actual future spatial population values using the proposed algorithm was less than 2%, which was 56.5% lower than the other two prediction algorithms on average. The proposed land simulation model reached the highest accuracy at 100 iterations with an average fitness of  $2.4\times 10 ^{11}$ , which was 13% and 27% higher than the other two traditional neural network algorithms, respectively. In the two simple functions of f1 and f2, the highest convergence accuracy reached  $10^{-30}$  and  $10^{-10}$ , respectively. In the two more complicated functions of f3 and f4, the optimal solutions were approximated in the ranges of [ $10^{2}$ ,  $10^{12}$ ] and [ $10^{-2}$ ,  $10^{6}$ ] without significant fluctuations. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can effectively predict the number of territorial space in macro and micro simulation, and has high feasibility and accuracy.

Reduced emissions of greenhouse gases are largely attributable to the agricultural sector. Governments worldwide are implementing laws to encourage the usage of low-carbon energy sources, which are becoming increasingly important due to the worsening impacts of climate change. The food and agriculture industries are utilising sensors and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to control processes, track quality, and ensure safety. WSNs facilitate real-time data collection and monitoring of environmental parameters, enhancing agricultural systems’ capacity to adapt to climate challenges. Because machine learning (ML) is currently being utilized to solve environmental concerns, it is an opportune time to explore ML models for CO2 projections from the agri-food sector. Additionally, the implementation of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) in WSNs allows for efficient management of data transmission, ensuring reliable data collection while reducing the risk of data loss. By enhancing our capacity to predict future energy demand and resource availability, the scientific community and businesses stand to gain substantially from artificial intelligence and big data analysis. This research presents a hybrid model named Whale-Wolf, grounded in nature-inspired algorithms. It aims to address carbon dioxide emissions from the food and agriculture industry. By hybridising Whale Optimization and Grey Wolf Optimization, this research efficiently anticipates carbon emissions and facilitates low-carbon economic calculations.

In this paper, two hybrid deep learning models CNN-LSTM and CoAtNet are implemented to improve verification accuracy based on a signature's dynamic features such as spatial co-ordinates, pen pressure, velocity, acceleration etc. The hybrid CNN-LSTM works with both spatial and temporal patterns to extract meaningful patterns from dynamic data, while CoAtNet uses convolutional layers and transformer-based layers to perform stronger feature extraction using attention-based mechanisms. Two real world datasets, SIGNDUMP and SignatureFeatures dataset were used for experimentation and analysis. The results indicate that CNNLSTM is 99.22% accurate with big data and outperforms CoAtNet (97.90%). On the contrary, CoAtNet outperforms CNN-LSTM (94.89%) for small datasets and achieves 97.34% accuracy with SIGNDUMP. The findings exhibit the complementary abilities of the two architectures in signature verification.

It is also the reflection of our growing dependence and reliance on the various technologies and solutions, which we use in our work, in our daily activities or to entertain ourselves, with the ultimate aim to solve our problems, to drive innovations and to create a better future. The digital transformation is not just the adoption of the new tools, systems or solutions, but the cultural and operational evolution, which is redefining the traditional operations and processes, and is representing how the governments, industries, organizations, companies, educational institutions and societies are changing their way of functioning, driven by the rapid advancement of the emerging technologies. This phenomenon is not something new, but rather a process that started in the 1980s with the widespread of the computers and the digital technologies. The process then continued with the advent of the mobile communications and the Internet, which were then followed by the social media platforms, cloud computing solutions, Big Data analytics and most recently by technologies and solutions, like the 3D technologies, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, 5G communications and others.

Venkatraman,Robust Intelligent Malware Detection Using Deep Learning,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2906934,,"Security breaches due to attacks by malicious software (malware) continue to escalate posing a major security concern in this digital age. With many computer users, corporations, and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks, malware detection continues to be a hot research topic. Current malware detection solutions that adopt the static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven to be ineffective in identifying unknown malwares in real-time. Recent malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive techniques to change the malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares. Such new malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are being employed recently to conduct an effective malware analysis. However, such approaches are time consuming as they require extensive feature engineering, feature learning, and feature representation. By using the advanced MLAs such as deep learning, the feature engineering phase can be completely avoided. Recently reported research studies in this direction show the performance of their algorithms with a biased training data, which limits their practical use in real-time situations. There is a compelling need to mitigate bias and evaluate these methods independently in order to arrive at a new enhanced method for effective zero-day malware detection. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper, first, evaluates the classical MLAs and deep learning architectures for malware detection, classification, and categorization using different public and private datasets. Second, we remove all the dataset bias removed in the experimental analysis by having different splits of the public and private datasets to train and test the model in a disjoint way using different timescales. Third, our major contribution is in proposing a novel image processing technique with optimal parameters for MLAs and deep learning architectures to arrive at an effective zero-day malware detection model. A comprehensive comparative study of our model demonstrates that our proposed deep learning architectures outperform classical MLAs. Our novelty in combining visualization and deep learning architectures for static, dynamic, and image processing-based hybrid approach applied in a big data environment is the first of its kind toward achieving robust intelligent zero-day malware detection. Overall, this paper paves way for an effective visual detection of malware using a scalable and hybrid deep learning framework for real-time deployments.",2019,2025-10-16 11:40:29,2025-10-16 11:40:29,,46717-46738,,,7,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Computer security; Cyber security; cybercrime; deep learning; Deep learning; Feature extraction; image processing; machine learning; Malware; malware detection; scalable and hybrid framework; static and dynamic analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adaptive modulation is an effective technique for enhancing data transmission rates in smart systems. However, traditional adaptive modulation approaches are not suitable for BDT in smart systems because the delays caused by the large amount of transmitted data lead to difficulty in evaluating the channel quality. In this article, we propose a nondata-aided error vector (NDA-EVM) that can be employed in adaptive modulation over wireless channels. The proposed NDA-EVM can be used to evaluate the channel quality and symbol error rate (SER), which reflect the quality of service (QoS) of the system. We formulated the relationship between the NDA-EVM and SER, which provides a basis for designing adaptive modulation techniques for smart systems. To address the low average spectrum efficiency (ASE) caused by BDT queue delays, an adaptive modulation strategy based on the finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) of the NDA-EVM [i.e., NDA-EVM adaptive modulation (NDA-EVM-AM)] was designed. This method simplifies the adaptive modulation algorithm for smart systems to search for the optimal transfer probability in the FSMC matrix based on two typical states: 1) the resident state and 2) transient state. Moreover, we proposed an analytical procedure to describe queuing behavior to analyze the performance of the NDA-EVM-AM algorithm for smart systems in smart cities. The performance is compared with that of a conventional adaptive modulation algorithm through simulations. The results show that compared with traditional adaptive modulation, NDA-EVM-AM obtains a lower packet loss rate and higher spectral efficiency for smart systems.",2023-11-01,2025-10-16 11:40:29,2025-10-16 11:40:29,,18672-18685,,21,10,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adaptive modulation; Adaptive systems; big data transmission (BDT); Internet of Things; Modulation; nondata-aided error vector (NDA-EVM); Quality of service; Signal to noise ratio; smart cities; Smart cities; smart systems; Symbols,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering that digital alternative payment methods represent a key factor to the smart cities development, in this study we propose an innovative payment solution aimed at improving the remittance flows by exploiting the potential of blockchain technology. Traditional banking remittance systems are characterized by high transaction fees and long transfer times, therefore they encourage the adoption of informal channels for money transfer with consequent losses in the economic system. By focusing our interest in a specific country of Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia, we launch an innovative blockchain based system able to make the remittance process safer, faster and to allow secure and reliable transactions between the counterparts in data sharing. We describe its architecture, which enables a secure management of big data and the different stages of solution design. Furthermore, the system guarantees the compliance with the Ethiopian government's recommendations on the matter, in particular it allows to encourage formal data collection on remittances and to support the introduction of new technology in the payments system. In addition, its use by individuals could improve awareness and financial education in Ethiopia and it can help prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism.",2019-07-29,2025-10-16 11:40:29,2025-10-16 11:40:29,,1165-1170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC),,,,Big Data; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrencies; Developing countries; Government; Investment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of sensors in Society 5.0 is critical. Sensors and the Internet of Things can be considered to work as a service system. Specifically, sensors can track millions of objects to support city security. This article considers the competitive sensor networks in terms of Quality of Service, which can be quantified by service price. The sensors are modeled as an $M/M/1/n$ queueing service system with a location on a secured grid area. A competitive admission fee is considered for tracking orders from society, which makes the arriving tracking demands price-sensitive. Moreover, a bi-level nonlinear program is developed wherein the first level maximizes the sensors’ revenue and social benefit revenue while also minimizing the wait time of tracking orders from society; in the second level, the expected damage cost is minimized from a disruptive scenario toward valuable infrastructure. Moreover, the second-level model is linearized, and it solves the problem by a branch and bound and enumeration algorithm.

As a matter of fact, social networks are increasingly considered to understand the opinion trend about a politician or related to a certain event that occurred: in general social networks have been proved useful to understand the public opinion from both governments and companies. In addition, also from the end users point of view it is difficult to identify real contents. This is the reason why in last years we are witnessing a growing interest in tools for analyzing big data gathered from social networks in order to find common opinions. In this context, content polluters on social networks make the opinion mining process difficult to browse valuable contents. In this paper we propose a method aimed to discriminate between pollute and real information from a semantic point of view. We exploit a combination of word embedding and deep learning techniques to categorize semantic similarities between (pollute and real) linguistic sentences.

Where the dependency is more, the security risks increases and as known cyber-attacks on network communication has increased over a decade against organization firms, government firms and even individuals. Currently, shielding private data, research data and maintaining confidentiality is a critical problem. Hence, it is necessary to develop an intrusion detection system to identify various unknown attacks. As the data flow in network is continuous, capturing it results in huge volume of data so, we need big data technologies like Apache Spark to handle those data and give us the information in short period of time. Machine learning is a powerful investigation structure to distinguish odd occasions happened in the system traffic stream. In this work, we developed Apache Spark and Machine Learning based Network Intrusion detection system which is capable of analyzing the huge data from the network traffic data. We evaluated the performance of Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree and Random Forest classification algorithms for network intrusion detection system using Apache Spark platform.

The data analysis can offer insightful information for raising the quality of life and improving urban services. However, data fusion and analysis are made more difficult by the large-scale nature of smart city data. An improved method for big data analytics for smart cities is presented in this abstract, with a particular emphasis on the fusion and analysis of multimodal data. Integrating heterogeneous data from several sources, such as text, photos, videos, and sensor measurements, is known as multimodal data fusion. A more complete understanding of the city can be attained by merging these many data modalities. To establish a single representation for analysis, the fusion process uses feature extraction, data preprocessing, and integration techniques. There are several opportunities created by the analysis of multimodal data in smart cities. It makes it possible to find intricate patterns like social behavior, environmental pollution, and traffic congestion. Predictive models that foretell future occurrences and optimize resource allocation can be constructed by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques. Additionally, data analytics may support decision-making by giving city officials and urban planners up-to-the-minute information and practical advice. To create strong data analytics frameworks and integrate them into the architecture of smart cities, interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists, urban designers, subject matter experts, and policymakers is necessary.

Data breaches increase in a daily basis. The main target for attackers is organization sensitive data which includes personal identifiable information (PII) such as social security number (SSN), date of birth (DOB) and credit card /debit card (CCDC). The other target is encryption/decryption keys or passwords to get access to the sensitive data. The cloud computing is emerging as a solution to store, transfer and process the data in a distributed location over the Internet. Big data and internet of things (IoT) increased the possibility of sensitive data exposure. Most methods used for the attack are hacking, unauthorized access, insider theft and false data injection on the move. Most of the attacks happen during three different states of data life cycle such as data-at-rest, data-in-use, and data-in-transit. Hence, protecting sensitive data at all states particularly when data is moving to cloud computing environment needs special attention. The main purpose of this research is to analyze risks caused by data breaches, personal and organizational weaknesses to protect sensitive data and privacy. The paper discusses methods such as data classification and data encryption at different states to protect personal and organizational sensitive data. The paper also presents mathematical analysis by leveraging the concept of birthday paradox to demonstrate the encryption key attack. The analysis result shows that the use of same keys to encrypt sensitive data at different data states make the sensitive data less secure than using different keys. Our results show that to improve the security of sensitive data and to reduce the data breaches, different keys should be used in different states of the data life cycle.",2019-01-07,2025-10-16 11:40:29,2025-10-16 11:40:29,,0177-0183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE 9th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC),,,,cloud computing; Cloud computing; Computational modeling; Data breach; data breaches; data classification; data security; data state; encryption; Encryption; encryption key; Government; sensitive data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 IEEE 9th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To unveil the interaction mechanism among a large number of agents between the online and offline social networks, in this paper we propose the public opinion dynamics model in an online-offline social network context. Next, in the theory aspect we investigate the analytical conditions to form a consensus in the public opinion dynamics model. Furthermore, we conduct the extensive simulations to investigate how the online agents impact the dynamics of public opinion formation, and unfold that the online agents shorten the steady-state time, decrease the number of opinion clusters, and smoothen the opinion changes in the opinion dynamics. The increase in the size of the online agents often enhances these effects.

The Internet of Things (IoT) has been emerged as an efficient solution to build smart healthcare systems deployed either at hospitals or in-home. Such networks rely on biomedical sensors which are used in electronics-based medical equipment to remotely collect vital signs of patients (pressure, temperature, hart rate, oxygen saturation etc.). Generally, these biosensors are implemented on or inside the patient's body and take three types of record data such as numerical, images and videos. However, the big data collected by various biomedical sensors along with the need of emergency detection, the limited sensor energies, and the prediction of the progress of patient situation are the major challenges for health-based IoT applications. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose, in this paper, an efficient sensor-based data analytics for real-time patient monitoring and assessment to help both hospital and medical staff. The proposed mechanism consists in three phases: Emergency detection, adapting sensing frequency and real time prediction of patient situation. Through simulations on real health data, we show the effectiveness of our mechanism compared to other exiting techniques.",2021-01-15,2025-10-16 11:40:29,2025-10-16 11:40:29,,974-984,,2,21,,IEEE Sensors Journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,adaptive sampling rate; Biomedical monitoring; Biosensors; connected heathcare; Data analysis; data prediction; emergency detection; energy efficiency; Internet of Things; Internet of Things (IoT); Medical services; Patient monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The world economic market is experiencing a big shift and the share market has observed crashes day-by-day. Even, the Indian economy has witnessed a slowdown in the current pandemic, and recovery of it is quite difficult. The restrictions and restrain strategies (e.g., lockdown and social distancing) introduced by the government leave many professions and facilities in a dormant state, catalyzing economy downfall. It necessitates to improve economy along with control strategies of COVID-19, which is a challenging task. To handle the above-mentioned issues, this article proposes a novel economy-boosting scheme, i.e.,  $\xi $  boost, which is a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics (BDA) integrated with the Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based data communication. Here, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) model is anticipated for early prediction of total positive cases as well as the economy. Then, it calculates an optimal subsegment of days, in which trade and commerce related restrictions could be reduced to control a sharp decline in the economy. Next, a spark-based pre and post unlock (PPU) analytics is carried out on the rise of COVID-19 cases to validate the intensity of testing in the country and deciding economy-boosting activities. Then, the  $\xi $  boost scheme is evaluated based on various factors such as prediction accuracy and others while comparing to existing approaches.

Data collection and aggregation are necessary pre-steps to enable data analysis. However, data may be dispersed across multiple places and in different formats. Even worse, data can be encrypted under various encryption mechanisms when data owners try to secure the confidentiality of the data. This makes data aggregation extremely challenging, if not impossible, especially when the encryption keys cannot be shared for various reasons. In this paper, we take the first step in addressing this problem. More specifically, we propose a new notion of cross-domain encryption switching service that securely bridges two well-studied encryption mechanisms, namely traditional public key encryption and identity-based encryption. As of independent interest, our notion supports keyword search over encrypted data, i.e., after encryption switching one may search over the (outsourced) data without loss of data and query secrecy. We provide a provably-secure instantiation satisfying the notion, and further present the efficiency analysis to show the scalability.

As a part of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm, MCS serves the quest for a more efficient operation of a smart city. Big data techniques employed on this data produce inferences about the participants' environment, the smart city. However, sufficient amounts of data are not always available. Sometimes, the available data are scarce as it is obtained at different times, locations, and from different MCS participants who may not be present. As a consequence, the scale of data acquired may be small and susceptible to errors. In such scenarios, the MCS system requires techniques that acquire reliable inferences from such limited data sets. To that end, we resort to small data (SD) techniques that are relevant for scarce and erroneous scenarios. In this article, we discuss SD and propose schemes to tackle the problems associated with such limited data sets, in the context of the smart city. We propose two novel quality metrics: 1) MAD quality metric (MAD-Q) and 2) MAD bootstrap quality metric (MADBS-Q), to deal with SD, focusing on evaluating the quality of a data set within MCS. We also propose an MCS-specific coverage metric that combines the spatial dimension with MAD-Q and MADBS-Q.

The stakeholders that deliver pervasive applications are now able to address fundamental challenges in the big data value chain, from data acquisition, data analysis and processing, data storage and curation, and data visualisation in real scenarios. Industry 4.0 is pushing this trend forward, demanding for servitization of products and data, also for the smart cities sector where humans, sensors and devices are operating in strict collaboration. The data produced by the ubiquitous devices must be processed quickly to allow the implementation of reactive services such as situational awareness, video surveillance and geo-localization, while always ensuring the safety and privacy of involved citizens. This paper proposes a modular architecture to (i) leverage innovative technologies for data acquisition, management and distribution (such as Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi), (ii) develop a multi-layer engineering solution for revealing valuable and hidden societal knowledge in smart cities environment, and (iii) tackle the main issues in tasks involving complex data flows and provide general guidelines to solve them.

Our study explores the phenomenon of government-oriented data intermediaries, which act as platforms to facilitate data transactions and enhance social welfare in China. Our study contributes by applying two-sided market theory to compare the performance of these intermediaries with one-to-one data transactions, and by analyzing how property rights are determined and allocated in data transactions on government-oriented data intermediaries. We find that centralized property rights enforcement adopted by Chinese data intermediaries lowers transaction costs and agency problems, reduces information asymmetry and bargaining power imbalance, providing a fair and efficient trading environment for data suppliers and demanders. In this way, Chinese government ensures data security and credibility, safeguards data suppliers’ ownership and control rights, and regulates data demanders’ usage rights and restrictions, and minimizes conflicts and disputes. By promoting data sharing and exchange, the framework of government-oriented data intermediaries will stimulate innovation and economic growth in China. We also provide several policy implications and suggestions, such as developing suitable contractual clauses, choosing an optimal transaction modes among market, vertical integration and hybrids, and ensuring property rights enforcement.",2023-12-14,2025-10-16 11:40:40,2025-10-16 11:40:40,,876-881,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2023 19th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN)",,,,Big Data; Data security; Data transaction; Government; Government-oriented data intermediary; Hybrid power systems; Industries; Property rights; Sensors; Technological innovation; Two-sided market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023 19th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective is to facilitate faster and more accurate retrieval of relevant data to realize intelligent data services. Among these, deep hash-based cross-modal data retrieval with incremental learning has garnered significant attention for its vast application potential and has also captured the interest of industry professionals and technologists.Design/methodology/approach-This study approaches the understanding and enhancement of data retrieval models from the angles of data, characteristics, and coding within practical application systems. The further comprehension of the retrieval model is primarily exemplified by: 1. A deeper understanding of dynamic depth models. Deep models are often viewed as black boxes, yet dynamically changing data necessitates the further integration of multiple deep retrieval models. This project aims to investigate and comprehend the connectivity of dynamic depth models, drawing from the concept of mode connectivity in loss landscapes within existing deep networks, to provide a more robust theoretical explanation for data retrieval models under dynamic changes. 2. A more profound understanding of the retrieval capabilities of hash coding. The loss of information during the hash binary coding process is a significant bottleneck contributing to the decline in retrieval performance. This project endeavors to define the retrieval capability from a quantitative perspective and to elucidate the reasons behind the weaker retrieval ability of hash coding, thereby enabling researchers to gain a more nuanced understanding. Based on these insights, the enhancement of the retrieval model is primarily reflected in: The improvement of the feature expression ability of the dynamic depth model, exploring linear connectivity, attention-based connectivity, and non-linear connectivity methods; and the enhancement of the retrieval ability of hash coding, researching approaches from Bayesian methods and segmented coding, among others.Findings-In conclusion, deep Hashing holds clear scientific significance and promising application prospects, with the potential to support critical practical applications such as human-machine dialogue, intelligent transportation, smart healthcare, and government governance.Practical impliactions-The multimodal hash retrieval technique and object keypoint positioning technique examined in this paper can be utilized to automatically identify object keypoints (e.g., locating the eyes, nose, and chin in a facial image).This task is a fundamental technology for various computer applications, including face recognition, object tracking, and pose estimation. The precise positioning of object keypoints is a fundamental problem with far-reaching social and economic impacts, applicable to fine portrait analysis technology, commodity search, security systems, image recognition, machine translation, identity verification, intelligent case processing, intelligent transportation, intelligent finance, intelligent education, intelligent manufacturing, and big data governance, among other systems.Originality/value-With the advent of new generations of technological revolutions in artificial intelligence and big data, any breakthrough in related technologies portends immeasurable commercial value and societal benefits (such as chatGPT and GPT-4o technologies).",2025-07-11,2025-10-16 11:40:41,2025-10-16 11:40:41,,48-55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2025 International Conference on IOT, Data Science and Advanced Computing (IDSAC)",,,,Big Data; Biological system modeling; Data models; Data retrieval; Deep Hashing Retrieval; Deep learning method; Encoding; Image coding; Incremental Data; Industries; Sorting; Technological innovation; Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025 International Conference on IOT, Data Science and Advanced Computing (IDSAC)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An example of open big data is healthcare, disease and epidemiological data such as privacy-preserving statistics on patients who suffered from epidemic diseases like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Analyzing these open big data can be for social good. For instance, analyzing and mining the disease statistics helps people to get a better understanding of the disease, which may inspire them to take part in preventing, detecting, controlling and combating the disease.

Analyzing such academic big data and discovering knowledge can discover comprehensive and predictive academic intelligence and provide corresponding services, which are valuable for scholars, journals, institutions and governments for career assessment, topic selection, funding management and resource allocation. This paper proposes a heterogeneous knowledge-learning method for understanding and predicting academic impact in the transportation field. The proposed method is illustrated on the academic big data collected from the papers published in 34 transportation journals from 2008 to 2018. We extract four types of features including bibliometric, altmetric, network and semantic features, and build hybrid feature embedding via TransR and Doc2vec that involving domain knowledge. Further, an academic impact prediction model for articles named as Hy-LSTM-Att is proposed, which weighs the hybrid features by the attention mechanism and predicts academic impact with the bi-LSTM recurrent neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Hy-LSTM-Att model outperforms competing shallow and deep learning models.

This is usually achieved through solving a series of large-scale common and fundamental problems such as linear systems of equations, linear programs, etc. However, it is a very challenging task for resource-limited clients and small companies to solve such problems as the data volume keeps increasing. With cloud computing, an alternative is to solve complex problems by outsourcing them to the cloud. Nonetheless, data privacy is one of the main concerns. Many previous works on privacy-preserving outsourcing are based on cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption and have very high computational complexity, which may not be practical for big data applications. In this paper, we design an efficient privacy-preserving outsourcing algorithm based on arithmetic operations only for large-scale convex separable programming problems. Specifically, we first develop an efficient transformation scheme to preserve data privacy. Then we linearize the convex functions with arbitrary accuracy and solve the problem by outsourcing it to the cloud. The client can efficiently verify the correctness of the returned results to prevent any malicious behavior of the cloud.

Thousands of interconnected IoT devices produce an enormous volume of data termed as big data. However, privacy protection has become one of the biggest problems with the progress of big data. Personal privacy is usually challenged by the development of technology. In this paper, we focus on privacy protection for location trajectory data, which is collected in intelligent transportation system. First, we demonstrate that the moving preference of individuals can be exploited to perform re-identification attacks, which may cause serious damage to the identity privacy of users. To address this re-identification problem, we present a new trajectory anonymity model, in which the degree of correlation between parking locations and individuals is precisely characterized by a concept of Location Frequency-inverse user frequency (LF-IUF, for short). We then propose an anonymizing method to replace parking locations by a k-correlation region. Our method provides a novel anonymity solution for publishing trajectory data, which achieves a better trade off between privacy and utility.

The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers.

With this uptick in persons with dementia (PWD), managing dementia-induced agitation, a behavior present in 90 precent of PWD characterized by physical aggression, verbal outburst, or other troubling behavior, is a pressing issue [1]. Caregiver burden associated with agitation is one of the leading causes a community-based PWD is institutionalized [2], so by supporting PWD-caregiver dyads, we improve individual quality of life and relieve stress placed on the global healthcare system. Use of AI technology, big data, and integrated networks of wearable and ambient sensors has enabled continuous monitoring of dementia care. However, most methods focus on data collection at the early stages of dementia. More research is needed on how novel technologies can empower PWD and their caregivers to take action to manage agitation and support them in the long term as symptoms progress. Moreover, current methods have not taken full advantage of the information obtained and do not provide personalized care. In this paper, we use the Universal Village (UV) perspective to evaluate the current status of smart technologies with the potential for use in preventing and mitigating agitation while providing support to the caregiver. We conduct evaluations based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that a robust PWD agitation management system should take into consideration the interaction between the smart healthcare system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart response system for city emergency, smart environmental protection and smart humanity, and also study how managing agitation would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study will help us explore in depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design.

City-rankings have become a central tool for assessing the attractiveness of urban regions. The development of smart cities, however, is not without risk. Cities and citizens are putting more and more responsibilities in urban systems. Hence, all key stakeholders should provide an effective safety and security response to any situation affecting their citizens or organizations. Special attention should be paid with respect to development of services aimed at reducing cybercrime. To prevent this, we believe that a better understanding of smart cities and their privacy implications is needed. The paper provides an overview of security aspects of a cyber security in smart cities. It starts with exploration of various definitions, threats, and risks in cyber security as well as threats from environments both internal and external and how these threats are currently mitigated with tools, processes and technologies as smart cities utilizes IoT with big data. Presently, most of the data is transmitted and collected online. Hackers usually try to exploit the vulnerabilities using various tools in order to know more about the customers and then misuse the customer's information. Enterprises, on the other hand, continue to collect more information in order to improve services, infrastructure, and security. They collect tons of data from customers in order to complete their requirements for the different services they provide. The main concern with the collected data is that it can be vulnerable to misuse by hackers. Building a security framework based on concepts and repositories of big data and leveraging on the intelligence of predictive analytics can help build a security system that can counter these threats and help to guard from these risk and threats to a large extent. Various concepts, applications, and technologies interact to cover every aspect of the digital citizen's life. Understanding this privacy-challenging environment is the basic requirement for the development of effective protection mechanisms. Thus, the paper aims to address sentiments on cyber security technologies and cybercrime awareness in order to come up with recommendations for innovative solutions.

Evans,Integrating ‘Big’ geoscience data into the petascale national environmental research interoperability platform (NERDIP): Successes and unforeseen challenges,2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),,,10.1109/BigData.2015.7363981,,"The Australian Government has begun an initiative to organise publicly funded national data assets and make them accessible for research through the Research Data Services initiative (RDS), which supports over 40 PBytes of multidisciplinary data at eight nodes around Australia. One of these nodes is at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) that provides a national comprehensively integrated high performance computing facility. NCI is a partnership between the ANU, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Commonwealth Science and Industry Research Organisation (CSIRO) and particularly focuses on Earth system sciences. As part of its activity in RDS, NCI has collocated over 10 PBytes of priority research data collections spanning a wide range of disciplines from geosciences, geophysics, environment, climate, weather, and water resources, through to astronomy, bioinformatics, and the social sciences. To facilitate access, maximise reuse and enable integration across the disciplines, data have been built into a platform that NCI has called, the National Environmental Research Data Interoperability Platform (NERDIP). The platform is co-located with the significant HPC resources: a 1.2 PetaFlop supercomputer (Raijin), and a HPC class 3000 core OpenStack cloud system (Tenjin). Combined, they offer unparalleled opportunities for geosciences researchers to undertake innovative Data-intensive Science at scales and resolutions never before attempted, as well as enabling participation in new collaborations in interdisciplinary science. However, compared with other `Big Data' science disciplines (climate, oceans, weather, astronomy), current geoscience data management practices and data access methods need significant work to be able to scale-up and thus to take advantage of the changes in the global computing landscape. Although the geosciences have many `Big Data' collections that could be incorporated within NERDIP, they typically comprise heterogeneous files that are distributed over multiple sites and sectors, and it is taking considerable time to aggregate these into large High Performance Data (HPD) sets that are structured to facilitate uptake in HPC environments. Once incorporated into NERDIP, the next challenge is to ensure that researchers are ready to both use modern tools, and to update their working practises so as to process these data effectively. This is an issue in part because the geoscience community has been slow to move to peak-class systems for Data-intensive Science and integrate with the rest of the Earth systems community.",2015-11-29,2025-10-16 11:40:41,2025-10-16 11:40:41,,2005-2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),,,,Big data; Big Data; Clouds; Data Platforms; Data-intensive Science; Earth; Geology; Geosciences; High Performance Computing; High Performance Data; Meteorology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In summary, this study intends to develop a recommender system including cloud data base, analytical module and user interface. Based on continuous Markov chain, we analyze data according to the historical electricity data; through time series analysis and multi-objective programming models, a long-term investment of renewable energy decision supports and the best combination of renewable energy can be revealed.

As a result, Intelligent Home Energy Management Systems are vital for smart city and smart home energy efficiency optimisation. Unfortunately, there aren't many low-cost, easy-to-implement, and low-maintenance solutions available, which is preventing their widespread adoption. There are also difficulties in storing, managing, and analysing the massive amounts of data produced from many sources. Big Data and the IoT provide scalable answers to these problems by allowing us to sense, monitor, and control the energy consumption in our homes. Preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training are the three steps that make up the proposed Intelligent Home Energy Management System. Before offline feature extraction and grouping, normalisation is used as a preprocessing step. BO-BiLSTM is used to train the model, which improves the accuracy of predictions. With better efficiency and scalability, the suggested method beats the standard BiLSTM and BO-LSTM models, according to the results. The system's integration of IoT and Big Data allows it to more reliably regulate energy use and successfully overcome deployment hurdles. Improving computing efficiency and integrating real-time adaptive learning for additional optimisation can be the subject of future study.",2025-06-06,2025-10-16 11:40:41,2025-10-16 11:40:41,,1-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2025 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Knowledge Extraction (ICICKE),,,,bayesian optimization (BO); Computational modeling; Energy efficiency; Energy management systems; Feature extraction; Internet of Things; internet of things (IoT); Monitoring; Optimization; Real-time systems; Reliability; smart home energy management (SHEM); Smart homes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Knowledge Extraction (ICICKE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nepal,Protecting the location privacy of mobile social media users,2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),,,10.1109/BigData.2016.7840718,,"Unprecedented volumes of location-based information have been produced as a result of the widespread adoption of social network applications and GPS-enabled devices and sensors. Publication of such location data can provide valuable resources for researchers and government agencies in applications ranging from near real-time population-wide health monitoring to planning for future cities. However, such data hold personally identifying information, which gives rise to many privacy issues. There is thus a pressing need for ways to restrict this inherently identifying location-related information, however ideally we would like to preserve the utility of the data. Importantly, any such solution has to be scalable to large population-wide data scenarios. To tackle this, we introduce a novel differentially private hierarchical location sanitization (DPHLS) approach based on the concept “(α, r)-dataset” implemented through a Variable Order Mobility Markov Model (VO3M). We show how this system allows individual locations in personal trajectories to be protected using selection and frequency perturbation mechanisms using the “(α, r)-dataset”, leveraging past (published) location histories to obfuscate the user location in a flexible and controllable manner. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution is evaluated through the big data experiments that have been carried out using an OpenStack-based Cloud and Apache Sparkbased platform utilising large-scale social media trajectories. The experimental results suggest that the privacy publication algorithm can successfully scale to big data scenarios whilst retaining the utility of the datasets (trajectories) and preserving individual user privacy.",2016-12-05,2025-10-16 11:40:41,2025-10-16 11:40:41,,1143-1150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),,,,big data; Big data; Data privacy; differential privacy; Hidden Markov models; location privacy; Markov processes; Privacy; Sensitivity; social media; Trajectory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The consolidation of big data through smart applications within smart infrastructure systems allows large tech companies and government entities to gather and potentially exploit the personal information of consumers. These powerful organizations collect consumer data in order to perform analysis on it, trade or sell it, or simply store it for later use. The gathering of big data or metadata, data about data, provides an opportunity for the collector to observe or predict the behaviors of specific individuals or groups. Those holding this information could use it to promote their own agendas or to otherwise exploit those from whom it has been collected without their knowledge or consent. Additionally, the current lack of legislation and policies concerning the security of smart applications or IoT devices makes the possibility of security and privacy breaches more prevalent. A breach would allow access to sensitive information which would be a threat to security and privacy at an individual and/or national scale. Due to the dynamic nature of smart infrastructure, we employed a systems analysis of this problem as a methodological approach leading to three solutions. We recommend a three-part solution-based analysis, consisting of 1.) Financial Backing 2.) Creation of Policies and Regulations and 3.) Technical Integration.

To this end, these cities use technologies that involve the areas of the Internet of Things, Big Data, and Governance to make decisions by governments and authorities. In the field of Urban Computing, it is possible to use open data in the GTFS format to solve the problems of the urban transport system using complex network metrics that make it possible to model complex interactions between objects in high dimensionality. Stops and routes are modeled as a graph, characterized by complex network metrics. According to the literature, if there is an interruption of the urban transport system, we make an evaluation of the degree of vulnerability of the system in the search for solutions. The main goal of this paper is to propose an approach to analyze the vulnerability of the urban transport system using complex network metrics along with GTFS data in scenarios targeted failures. As a contribution, the proposed approach uses the concept of skewness in the methodology established in the literature. The skewness enables a better understanding and differential the failure conditions from the evaluation of the vulnerability the urban transport system, through a quantitative indication of which local metrics most influence the decay of network metrics. The analysis of the results obtained in the proposed approach serves as a subsidy for studies in the search for solutions to the problems of the urban transport system, providing a tool to the set of technological options for the planning of urban transport systems of smart cities available to governments and authorities.

This big data represents an opportunity to address data quality issues and identify anomalies. The detection of anomalies in data that significantly deviates from normal behavior is critical, as they can lead to economic losses. To extract valuable insights and mitigate such challenges, big data analytics platforms and machine learning techniques are increasingly being adopted. Their practical use is crucial in defining consumer-centric, sustainable, and resilient technologies for Industry 5.0. In this article, we address the problem of anomaly detection in electricity consumption for public street lighting. We present our approach and experience in analyzing anomalous behavior of public street lighting plants using electric energy data collected and provided by the ENEA PELL smart city platform. To this end, we adopt three well-known unsupervised clustering techniques: k-means, DBSCAN, and OPTICS. We conduct a comparative analysis of these methods using a real benchmark data set and additional data with known anomalies, used as ground truth data, to verify the correctness of the methods. We synthetically generate additional data from the real data set by automatically injecting anomalies based on specific patterns of anomalous behavior identified for the public street lighting domain. We examine the clustering methods’ performance by calculating their accuracy in detecting synthetic anomalies, as well as their computation cost. The experiments show that while K-means runs faster, DBSCAN is more accurate than K-means and OPTICS in detecting synthetic anomalies.",2024-02,2025-10-16 11:40:41,2025-10-16 11:40:41,,4524-4535,,1,70,,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anomaly detection; Big Data; big data analytics; Clustering algorithms; clustering techniques; Data analysis; Energy consumption; Fifth Industrial Revolution; Industry 5.0; Lighting; PELL smart city platform; public street lighting; Smart cities; Support vector machines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thinyane,Towards Informing Human-Centric ICT Standardization for Data-Driven Societies,Journal of ICT Standardization,,2246-0853,10.13052/jicts2245-800X.631,,"Information and communication technology (ICT) standards play a crucial role towards harnessing technological developments and shaping the technology landscape. ICT standards development is largely driven by standards developing organizations or standards setting organizations that represent and are informed by the perspectives and interests of the ICT private sector and the public sector. Thus the shaping of the standards is mostly driven by the business, technical, and legal impetus, towards facilitating greater market influence, coordination, integration, interoperability, and legal conformity. The technocentric, business-focused perspective to ICT developments, and corollary to ICT standards development, is distinct from and can be orthogonal to the human-centric perspective that elevates the role and centrality of the human concerns over the technology and business concerns. Notwithstanding the crucial role of business and technology, it remains that at the centre of the 21st century data-driven societies are individuals and end-users who are the primary actants and agents within the technology and data ecosystems. This gives motivation for infusing the human perspectives and values into technology development as well as into ICT standards development. This is more pronounced for cases where the business and technocentric interests are at odds and opposed to the human interests, such as, the need for increased datafication to support Big Data developments versus the need for individuals' privacy preservation. In this research, which is framed through a case study of personal health informatics in the context of sustainable development (i.e., sustainable development goal on “health and wellbeing” – SDG3) indicators monitoring, we have undertaken a survey to investigate the human-centric values and attitudes associated with the collection and use of personal data. From this inquiry, the paper highlights and surfaces: individuals attitudes and perceptions around monitoring of social indicators; key considerations associated with data ownership, privacy and confidentiality of data, as well as sharing of personal data within the data ecosystem.

Tamilselvam,Goal-Driven Context-Aware Data Filtering in IoT-Based Systems,2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2153-0017,,10.1109/ITSC.2015.351,,"One of the crucial research issues in an IoT-based system is how to manage the huge amount of data transmitted by the potentially large number of sensors that form the system. Prior research has focused on centralized cloud-based ""Big Data"" architectures for collecting, collating and analyzing the data. However, most of these scenarios accumulate thousands of petabytes in a short period of time, increasing the demand for more storage, and also slowing down speed of data analysis. Hence for real-time scenarios, e.g., agricultural crop tracking, traffic management, etc., such an approach would be impractical. Moreover, depending on the context in which the data is generated and is to be used, only a fraction of the data would be needed for analysis. Therefore, the challenges are to determine which data to keep and which to discard for both short term and long term usage, and define the contextual parameters along which this filtering is to be done. Hence one key problem addressed in this paper is how to define what data the user needs so that filtering algorithms can be defined to extract the data needed. To that end, in this paper, we present a goal driven, context-aware data filtering, transforming and integration approach for IoT-based systems. We propose a data warehouse-based data model for specifying the data needed at particular levels of granularity and frequency, that drive data storage and representation (aligned with the Semantic Sensor Network ontology). Throughout our paper, we illustrate our ideas via a realistic running example in the smart city domain, with emphasis on traffic management, and also present a proof of concept prototype.",2015-09-15,2025-10-16 11:40:41,2025-10-16 11:40:41,,2172-2179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,Big Data Internet of Things; Conferences; Context; Data Filtering; Goal Models; Intelligent transportation systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DEWI Bubble is defined here as a high-level abstraction of an industrial WSAN with enhanced interoperability (via standardized interfaces), technology reusability, and cross-domain development. This paper details the design criteria used to define the HLA and the organization of the infrastructure internal and external to the DEWI Bubble. The description includes the different perspectives, models or views of the architecture: the entity model, the layered model, and the functional view model (including an overview of interfaces). The HLA constitutes an extension of the ISO/IEC SNRA (sensor network reference architecture) towards the support of industrial applications. To improve interoperability with existing approaches the DEWI HLA also reuses some features from other standardized technologies and architectures. The HLA will allow networks with different industrial sensor technologies to exchange information between them or with external clients via standard interfaces, thus providing a consolidated access to sensor information of different domains.

However, because of their complementary features, we expect that their integration can foster a number of computing and network-intensive pervasive applications under the incoming realm of the future Internet. Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this position paper is fivefold. First, we review the technological attributes and platforms proposed in the current literature for the standing-alone FC and IoE paradigms. Second, by leveraging some use cases as illustrative examples, we point out that the integration of the FC and IoE paradigms may give rise to opportunities for new applications in the realms of the IoE, Smart City, Industry 4.0, and Big Data Streaming, while introducing new open issues. Third, we propose a novel technological paradigm, the Fog of Everything (FoE) paradigm, that integrates FC and IoE and then we detail the main building blocks and services of the corresponding technological platform and protocol stack. Fourth, as a proof-of-concept, we present the simulated energy-delay performance of a small-scale FoE prototype, namely, the V-FoE prototype. Afterward, we compare the obtained performance with the corresponding one of a benchmark technological platform, e.g., the V-D2D one.

To address this issue, a security policy of big data analysis has been proposed based on the analysis of log data of servers and terminals in Spark. However, in practical applications, Spark cannot suitably analyze very huge amounts of log data.

In this technique, we define and formulate the reuse degree of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Spark based on Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Then, we define a global optimization function to obtain the optimal DAG sequence, that is, the sequence with the least execution time. To implement the global optimization function, we further propose a novel cost optimization algorithm based on the traditional Genetic Algorithm (GA).

Nowadays, streaming data tends to collect data from live streaming to run analysis and generate reports for data prediction. This process requires skilled professional for acquiring data from live stream using complex coding and queries. The above drawback is overcome in this research work by implementing streaming algorithm to fetch data from twitter using a keyword search. The Twitter data visualization application is designed for data visualization, report generation and its analysis. The live twitter data is fetched by configuring the system with Hadoop, Hive warehouse and Apache Flume. By using flume agent, the keyword file is placed on Hadoop cluster to acquire relevant data via flume channel and then sink the collected data in Hadoop Distributed File System. The twitter data application creates a database in Hive and imports the collected data to Hive table for visualization. The output results are categorized for report generation and a graphical representation is used for sentimental analysis. The obtained positive, negative, neutral opinion from the tweets can be used for decision making. This application can be deployed for analyzing the real time public opinion about the Election, Government activities and any topic of societal interest.",2018-12-21,2025-10-16 11:41:17,2025-10-16 11:41:17,,1-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2018 International Conference on Circuits and Systems in Digital Enterprise Technology (ICCSDET),,,,Data mining; data visualization; Data visualization; live streaming; opinion mining; Real-time systems; sentiment analysis; Sentiment analysis; Tagging; topic detection; Twitter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018 International Conference on Circuits and Systems in Digital Enterprise Technology (ICCSDET),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Liu,Real-Time Traffic Pattern Collection and Analysis Model for Intelligent Traffic Intersection,2018 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE),,,10.1109/EDGE.2018.00028,,"The traffic congestion hits most big cities in the world - threatening long delays and serious reductions in air quality. City and local government officials continue to face challenges in optimizing crowd flow, synchronizing traffic and mitigating threats or dangerous situations. One of the major challenges faced by city planners and traffic engineers is developing a robust traffic controller that eliminates traffic congestion and imbalanced traffic flow at intersections. Ensuring that traffic moves smoothly and minimizing the waiting time in intersections requires automated vehicle detection techniques for controlling the traffic light automatically, which are still challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic pattern collection and analysis model, named TPCAM, based on traffic cameras to help in smooth vehicular movement on junctions and set to reduce the traffic congestion. Our traffic detection and pattern analysis model aims at detecting and calculating the traffic flux of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections in real-time. Our system can utilize one camera to capture all the traffic flows in one intersection instead of multiple cameras, which will reduce the infrastructure requirement and potential for easy deployment. We propose a new deep learning model based on YOLOv2 and adapt the model for the traffic detection scenarios. To reduce the network burdens and eliminate the deployment of network backbone at the intersections, we propose to process the traffic video data at the network edge without transmitting the big data back to the cloud. To improve the processing frame rate at the edge, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions. Based on the deep learning based detection and tracking, we can achieve pseudo-30FPS via adaptive key frame selection.",2018-07-02,2025-10-16 11:41:17,2025-10-16 11:41:17,,140-143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE),,,,Cameras; deep learning; edge devices; multiple object tracking; Object detection; Real-time systems; real-time traffic data; Robustness; Target tracking; traffic surveillance; Urban areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the current rate of technological growth, experts believe that the best-known factoring algorithms would take thousands of years to break a single RSA composite. But with a more efficient method, government agencies could quickly decrypt big data sets to better confront national security concerns. Our technique, Algorithmic Entropy Reduction in Bivariate Polynomials, takes a different approach from traditional methods in that it addresses the binary expansion of the primes without relying on number theory. The method evaluates if a valid solution can exist for a given bivariate polynomial (BVP) representation of each prime at every bit position. In doing so, the method ascertains each binary digit from least significant bit on the right-hand side to most significant bit on the left-hand side (entropy reduction).

Machine learning applications are not limited to driverless cars or online recommendations but are widely used in healthcare, social services, government systems, telecommunications, and so on. As many enterprises are trying to step up machine learning applications, it is critical to have a long-term strategy. Most of the enterprises are not able to truly realize the fruits of ML capabilities due to its complexity. It is easier to access a variety of data today due to data democratization, distributed storage, technological advancements, and big data applications. Despite easier data access and recent advancements in ML, developers still spend most of the time in data cleansing, data preparation, and data modeling for ML applications. These steps are often repeated and result in identical features. As identical features can have inconsistent processing while testing and training, more issues pop up at later stages in ML application development. The unification of ML features is an effective way to address these issues. This paper presents details about numerous methods to achieve ML features unification.",2020-07-13,2025-10-16 11:41:17,2025-10-16 11:41:17,,1201-1205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE 44th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",,,,"Big Data; Business; Complexity theory; Data models; Distributed databases; Machine learning; ML Pipeline, Feature Engineering, ML Development, Feature store, Big Data Engineering; Training",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2020 IEEE 44th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent developments in the IT industry have led to the growth of digital data in various fields like medical, government offices, education sector, banks, social media, digital library, and so on. Advancement in the recent technologies has paved their way to convert the traditional offices into paperless offices. Also, the growth of digital libraries, e-governance, and internet based applications has led to the increase in the volume of digital data, which mainly include texts, graphs, images, audio and video as various components in the document image by resulting in the development of complex document images, which are used for archival and transmission on regular basis. This paper proposes an idea for processing the document image in its compressed version by particularly focusing on how content matching and structural analysis can be performed in the compressed representation of document image. This gives an insight on the importance of processing document images in its compressed domain. Due to the exponential growth of data, the data is stored in compressed form. There is an actual need for investigating further research from the perspective of dealing directly with the compressed representation of document images as a remedy to the ever-increasing big data-related challenges.

While big data and algorithms have significant potential to inform decision-making, traditional evaluation methods often fail to accurately assess smart city performance indicators, limiting sustainable development. To address this limitation, our study applies the Best-Worst Method (BWM) to enhance the assessment of smart city indicators. Through a literature review and expert consultation, we identified five major obstacles to smart city development. Using BWM, we established the weights of these obstacles, identifying inadequate traffic management systems, limited public transportation coverage, poor satisfaction with online government services, and insufficient attraction of skilled talent as the most critical factors. By employing BWM, urban planners and policymakers can better identify essential evaluation indicators, facilitating more efficient resource allocation and informed decision-making. This approach offers a foundation for intelligent forecasting and development, ensuring that smart cities meet the evolving and complex needs of urban residents.",2024-12-20,2025-10-16 11:41:17,2025-10-16 11:41:17,,591-598,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2024 International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications (IUCC),,,,best worst method (BWM); Big Data; big data analytics (BDA); Decision making; Renewable energy sources; Resource management; Smart cities; smart city; sustainable development; Sustainable development; Systematic literature review; Technological innovation; Ubiquitous computing; Wastewater treatment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024 International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications (IUCC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, research on improving rainwater-drainage systems is important for damage prevention for inland flooding A conventional rainwater-drainage operation scheme is called “water-level control,” where a pump is started-up/stopped when the drainage-water level of the pump-well reaches a given threshold. To prevent inland flooding caused by heavy rain, the drainage-pump operator sometimes manually manipulates the water-level control and starts-up the pump before the rainwater level reaches the threshold. Notably, conventional rainwater-drainage system pumps have never been operated by applying rain-forecast big data, which is one of the factors that make rainwater-drainage systems unreliable. Our research focuses on improving the reliability of an autonomous system using IoT and rain-forecast big data. This paper describes the design of our improved rainwater-drainage system and discusses the verification results of the system's inland flood-damage prevention through drainage experiments and inland-flood analysis. These verification results show that even an improved system is insufficient for reducing inland flood damage. With further consideration, we suggest that an advanced extreme-heavy-rain prediction system is required. New research is underway to develop an AI system for predicting extremely heavy rainfall.

However, with the continuous improvement of the development of the financial market, the amount of time series data in the financial market is getting larger and larger, and the data generation and accumulation speed is fast. The traditional measurement model cannot meet the processing requirements of big data for nonlinear and high-noise data. In this paper, the financial time series prediction based on dual attention mechanism generating admittedly network is proposed. Firstly, the input attention mechanism is introduced into the generator to adaptively select the input features because the input features of the financial time series are too many and difficult to be selected adaptively. Secondly, the time attention mechanism is introduced into the generator to capture the long time dependence of financial time series, which is difficult to capture. We use the CSI 300 index to verify the prediction performance of the model, and the mean square error is 0.0012. The experimental results show that the model can adaptively select the input features, capture the long-term dependence of financial time series, reduce the prediction error of the model, and improve the prediction accuracy of the model.",2021-02-26,2025-10-16 11:41:18,2025-10-16 11:41:18,,246-249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2021 International Conference on Public Management and Intelligent Society (PMIS),,,,Adaptation models; Attentional mechanism; Data models; Financial time series; Generating adversarial network; Generators; Government; Mean square error methods; Predictive models; Time series analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 International Conference on Public Management and Intelligent Society (PMIS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HPC system can process big data and perform complex calculation at high speeds, where the system also generates a lot of heat continuously. The accumulated heat needs to be managed to avoid affecting the performance and lifetime of HPC system. Therefore, a key design and development of HPC products is to achieve high thermal dissipation in electronic devices. The application of thermal interface materials (TIMs) has been a promising thermal dissipation solution for electronic devices. However, the thermal conductivities of current silicone-based TIMs have been insufficient for future products. Indium is a potential candidate for high heat dissipation needs, because the thermal conductivity of pure indium is around 86 W/mK, which is higher than most silicone-based TIMs. When indium has been applied as a metallic TIM and jointed with the metal of surface finish, there is an intermetallic compound (IMC) reaction at the interface of indium joint. The phase and microstructure of IMC depend on the conditions of thermal treatments and the type of surface finish. The interfacial condition of indium joint is the key to heat dissipation performance. Therefore, the interfacial mechanism of indium joints have been investigated by applying different surface finishes and various heat treatments in this study.In this paper, the interfacial reactions of indium jointed with different surface finishes (Au/Ni(V) and Au/Ni) have been investigated, respectively. For studying the interfacial microstructure evolution of the indium joints, they have been treated with different thermal treatments, including reflow process (with 245°C peak temperature) and high temperature storage tests (aging at 100°C, 125°C, and 150°C for 250~1000 hours). The interfacial morphologies of indium joint and the growth behaviors of IMC have been observed, and the interfacial IMC has been identified as Ni28 In72 phase. For Au/Ni(V) surface finish, there is rock shaped IMC grains on the surface of Ni(V) layer, and the grain size of IMC increases with the increase of the reflow cycle. In Ni(V) layer, there is a significant In/Ni inter-diffusion reaction after different thermal treatments. For Au/Ni surface finish, the thickness of IMC increases with the increase of aging time and temperature, and the growth rate of IMC increases with the elevating storage temperature.",2022-10-26,2025-10-16 11:41:18,2025-10-16 11:41:18,,1-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2022 17th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference (IMPACT)",,,,Conductivity; Heating systems; HPC; IMCs; Indium; Microstructure; Performance evaluation; Surface morphology; Thermal conductivity; TIMs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2022 17th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference (IMPACT)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is anticipated that newer technologies, like the Internet of Things and cloud computation, will take advantage of this progress and expand the use of AI and robotics in agriculture. Big Data, which refers to vast quantities of diverse data that may be collected, examined, and used to judgement call, encompasses this concept. With the help of this study, you can learn about the most recent Big Data applications for smart farming and discover the associated societal inequalities that need to be resolved. A framework for analysis was created using a systematic methodology and may be used to future research on the subject. The analysis demonstrates that Big Data implementations in Smart Farming have a far wider impact than just resource extraction, having an impact on the whole food system. Big data are being utilized to restructure corporate systems for league season pricing models, drive satisfactory production choices, and give advanced analytics into agriculture production. Therefore, according to some experts, the present relationships of participants in the supply chain for food will see significant changes in the positions and dynamics between them. The partner picture shows an intriguing interplay of large tech corporations, VCs, and often tiny continue and challengers. Most government agencies simultaneously disclose open data with the need that privacy information be protected. Two distinct possibilities might play out in the development of smart agriculture: 1) Restricted, patent solutions where the farmer is a member of a fully interconnected food chain, or 2) open, communal systems where every participant in the chain network has the freedom to choose their own business relationships, both in terms of technical and crop supply. In the debate between these two possibilities, the continued growth of applications and data frameworks (portals and rules) and their administrative embedding will be of utmost importance.

As a result, the new network architecture gradually turns bidirectional, allowing IoT devices to do light processing in addition to serving as data harvesters. By moving some processing back to the “local,” edge computing, a novel architecture that is on the horizon, dramatically reduces latency and reliance associated with standard cloud-enabled networks. But when edge computing returns data and models to IoT devices, new security threats appear. Big data is being produced by rapidly expanding smart city applications like smart delivery, smart communities, and smart health, and it’s being shared freely online. Systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) are central to smart city applications, as conventional cloud computing is unable to provide the essential needs of intelligent Internet of Things systems. Owing to the sensitive nature of smart city applications, several privacy-preserving techniques, including homomorphic encryption, differential learning, and anonymity, have been used over the years. In addition, the resource consumption for maintaining data privacy in edge computing environments—which have fewer resources than cloud data centers—has received little attention. Differential privacy (DP) in particular has proven to be a successful privacy-preserving technique in the context of edge computing.

State-of-the-art research is revolutionizing the vision systems of the smart city, which converts the visual signals from sensory input into feature representations and conveys the compact feature for analysis by using the computational resources of both front and back ends. To deploy a robust model, large amounts of labeled data are usually required, and thereby heavy computational and communication resources are incurred in model training as well as inference. However, the computational resources in front-end devices are usually constrained, and heavy transmission burden is imposed when leveraging multiple models amongst different ends. In this work, we propose a novel collaborative computing approach for intelligent sensing and low-cost analysis, which reduces the requirement of labeled data and communication cost, and balances the computational load in model training and inference. By incorporating the adversarial learning mechanism into collaborative model training, knowledge of different domains can be better exploited. Moreover, the learned models are deployed for inference in a collaborative manner, in which part of model is placed in front-ends for extracting intermediate feature maps, and part of the model remains in back ends for inference with received feature maps. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been validated in the context of an emerging digital retina system for smart city intelligent applications.",2019-12-01,2025-10-16 11:41:32,2025-10-16 11:41:32,,1-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP),,,,adversarial learning; Collaboration; Computational modeling; Data models; deep learning model; edge computing; feature compression; Feature extraction; Image coding; Intelligent sensing; Load modeling; Sensors; Smart cities; Training; Visualization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 IEEE Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main problems are mainly due to big data volume and velocity and, in some cases, variety in both dimension and type. A practical approach to understanding and viewing big data features is through streaming operations. Streaming allows for both volume and velocity characteristics of big data, and often, for variety as well. However, performing analytics at interactive rates is currently an open challenge in most big data applications. Cloud computing platforms provide practical support and leverage to solving some of the big data and visual analytics problems, especially when dealing with the volume and velocity characteristics of current data generation. In order to interact with streaming data patterns in an elastic cloud environment, we present a new elastic framework for big data visual analytics in the cloud, the Cloudet. The Cloudet is a self-adaptive cloud-based platform that treats both data and compute nodes as elastic objects. The main objective is to readily achieve the scalability and elasticity of cloud computing platforms in order to process large streaming data and adapt to potential interactions between data stream features. Our main contributions include a robust cloud-based framework, the Cloudet, which can flexibly process the streaming data and applications to illustrate the setup and operations of this framework.

Generally the time taken to execute a query and return the results, increases exponentially as the amount of data increases leading to more waiting times on the user. This processing inability has led to the use of Hadoop to analyze and gain insights from the data. With its distributed processing capability, Hadoop is considered as an efficient solution for query processing but it has its own limitation when the data to be processed exhibit interest locality. Generally it is observed that the data required for any query execution follows grouping behavior wherein only a part of the Big-Data set is utilized more often. Since Hadoop default data placement strategy (HDDPS) does not consider such grouping behavior among the dataset, it does not perform efficiently resulting in lacunas such as decreased local map execution, increased query execution time etc. Hence in this paper we experiment the significance of two most promising Matrix clustering techniques viz. partitioning and hierarchical in grouping aware data placement for improved performance. Both clustering techniques are separately applied over the user history log to obtain independent data groupings. These data groupings are interpreted and validated to extract the optimal data grouping for improved parallel execution. The proposed strategy was tested in 15 node Hadoop cluster. The results show an improved performance for Big-Data sets in heterogeneous distributed environment. It improves the data locality by 25.75% and reduces query execution time by 28% compared to HDDPS. Also Hierarchical based Matrix clustering shows a marginal improved performance over Partitioning based methods for queries exhibiting interest localities.",2017-02-23,2025-10-16 11:41:32,2025-10-16 11:41:32,,1-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2017 National Conference on Parallel Computing Technologies (PARCOMPTECH),,,,Big Data; Big-Data; Clustering algorithms; Data Placement; Distributed databases; Hadoop; History; Interest Locality; Matrix Clustering; Partitioning algorithms; Semantics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 National Conference on Parallel Computing Technologies (PARCOMPTECH),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relevant studies have pointed out that the exposure of air pollutants has a strong connection with asthma and other unhealthy diseases such as the lungs. The air pollution has brought health issue, but also caused a huge medical costs each year derived from the disease. Although there are many different approaches to forecasting air pollution, most of them are based on historical data and the environment of local server devices. Some of the data records may differ from those of real-time situations and those limitation of traditional hardware devices. Therefore, this project tries to adopt Azure, a cloud computing platform with advantages of scalability, reliability and agility, to set up a multi-pollutant air quality deterioration warning system. This project is divided into three parts. The first part is the collection of multi-pollutant data and the prediction of multi-pollutant air pollution quality. After the government and private data are collected and integrated into the database, the air quality of multi-pollutant are predicted. The second part is big data analysis of air quality indicators for pollutants indicator AQI, AAQI, and HAQI AIDE, a real-time deterioration warning system for deteriorating, was popularized in Spark for big data analytics framework and various reports were generated.

The ability to anticipate the quality of the air in an area with precision and efficiency is one of the fundamental building blocks of a smart city. The amount of polluted air found in smart cities throughout the world has been gradually growing. Because of this, there has been a rise in the concentration of several air pollutants in the environment, including particulate matter (PM 10), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and PM 2.5, amongst others. Because of the possibility of uncontrollable repercussions, such as an increase in the severity of asthma and cardiovascular disease, this situation poses a risk to the country and to the people who live in it. Heavy industry and vehicle exhaust have been major contributors to the growth of air pollution in smart cities such as New Delhi, Bombay, Chandigarh, and Bengaluru in India. The purpose of this investigation is to compare and contrast the efficiency of a variety of machine learning methods in order to assess the precision of the air quality index (AQI) projection of PM 2.5 in Chandigarh, India. Models for predicting AQI are trained and tested using a variety of statistical techniques like Linear regression, Lasso regression, KNN regression, and Random Forest regression This Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) found for Linear regression, Lasso regression, KNN regression, and Random Forest regression are 31.01, 29,45, 37.09 and 28.3.

Particularly, To discover the hidden social event, spatio-temporal constraint generation process consists of three methods, which are i) generating spatio-temporal focus (STF), ii) allocating social texts to the STF, and iii) discovering social events in each STF. The STF can be composed by clustering social texts which are topically and spatially associated. To make the STF dynamic and incremental, we use windows for allocating a social text to an adequate STF. Lastly, the hidden social events are discovered from the STF on the basis of keywords and temporal distribution of the social texts.

The traditional method for storing information is becoming challenging to handle big data. The solution to storing big data is to store data on third-party service providers. Data protection is the primary concern for storing and accessing data due to the emerging rate of data breaches and adversaries in personal data storage. Intruders manage to access sensitive data despite many efforts to protect sensitive data. Homomorphic encryption is a data protection approach in the cryptographic domain that can perform computations on cipher data without decrypting it. The computation outcome is encrypted; the output will be the same when decrypted as if the operations had been performed on the original plaintext data. This encryption method for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation permits the data to be encrypted and outsourced to cloud environments for further processing.

However, the accuracy of economic forecasting and now casting models remains a challenge since modern economies are prone to multiple shocks that make forecasting and now casting activities extremely difficult, both in the short and medium range. The purpose of the paper is to identify the key aspects, which must be taken into account in big data sentiment analysis to solve the problem of forecasting and now casting tasks. The work has developed an mpBC-ELMo based BNM-cBLSTM for financial sentiment analysis in European Bond markets. The proposed framework is processed based on collection of big data that are formed into a corpus. Initially, the corpus data is subjected to preprocessing, which performs tokenization, Lemmatization, URL removal, punctuations removal, Dependency Parsing, Noun Phrases, Named Entity recognition, and Coreference Resolution in order to make the data healthier and to get a potential impact for analyzing the sentiments. Thereafter, the data is converted into a vector using mpBC-ELMo, which addresses the complex characteristics of the word as well as polarity and handles stock bond correlation invariant, behavioral biases. Finally, BNM-cBLSTM analyses the sentiments and provides an accurate as well as optimized improvisation.

In this talk we envision an Internet of Postal Things (IoPT) that embeds sensors and other data collection technologies into physical objects, infrastructures, and the surroundings in which people live and businesses operate. The declining cost of sensors, wireless data connectivity and storage opens up virtually unlimited opportunities to collect and process data from any device, infrastructure, machine and even human beings. The IoPT would transform the postal infrastructure (vehicles, mailboxes, machines, letter carriers etc.) and help the USPS bring data management to the next level. It would create new rich data sources that could help the Postal Service improve operational performance, customer service, create new products and services, and support more efficient decision-making processes. The IoPT could also have a positive effect on non-postal sectors. For example, the use of sensors on postal trucks to collect environmental data could benefit local governments.

In order for investors to invest with confidence and for countries to have more control over their virtual currencies, it is desirable to study Bitcoin in depth. To research Bitcoin deeply, this paper is devote to analyze what are the factors affecting the price of Bitcoin and research the approach to predicting Bitcoin’s price. First, the influce factors of Bitcoin are studied. It is found that the current factors affecting Bitcoin mainly include macro factors and Bitcoin itself. This study of factors may provide valuable information for investors to analyze the invest. Then, the classical Bitcoin prediction methods based on machine learning are reasearched. It mainly contains two kinds of methods, imprecise prediction and accurate prediction. These machine learning methods usually construct a neural network model based on the given dataset, and then use the neural network to predict the detailed price of Bitcoin. Although big data and machine learning can be used to predict the price trend of Bitcoin, it is not legal tender, and it is not guaranteed by the government. Bitcoin's large price fluctuations make it a risky investment. Therefore, it is suggested for investors to consider whether to invest in Bitcoin. Besides, there is a certain error or sudden world-class major events affect the prediction, so the prediction models can not provide certain information.

This is a scalable software architecture using Apache STORM. An Update Function (UF) is defined, which updates the scope of the data in the GraphLab. The Graph Rules, used by Graph Transformation, are defined to construct hidden layers in GraphLab to get more control over information flow. The ""Update Function"" and Graph Transformation trigger each other, which forms Hybrid GraphLab. The Hybrid GraphLab allows more flexible, fault tolerant, computational capabilities and possibilities to add more hidden multi-layers in tune with deep learning. Our algorithm can be extended to other applications like old age homes, hospitals etc for improved monitoring and management, with various sensors such as Gas Sensors, Light Sensors, Directionable Sensor Probes and Noise Sensors.",2015-09-18,2025-10-16 11:41:33,2025-10-16 11:41:33,,13-15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2015 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM),,,,Apache STORM; Cognitive Sensing; Deep Learning; Gas detectors; GraphLab; Intelligent sensors; Monitoring; Neural Network; Sensor Networks; Smart cities; Smart City; Storms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we identify the spatio-temporal (ST) causalities among air pollutants at different locations by mining the urban big data. This is challenging for two reasons: 1) since air pollutants can be generated locally or dispersed from the neighborhood, we need to discover the causes in the ST space from many candidate locations with time efficiency; 2) the cause-and-effect relations between air pollutants are further affected by confounding variables like meteorology. To tackle these problems, we propose a coupled Gaussian Bayesian model with two components: 1) a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN) to represent the cause-and-effect relations among air pollutants, with an entropy-based algorithm to efficiently locate the causes in the ST space; 2) a coupled model that combines cause-and-effect relations with meteorology to better learn the parameters while eliminating the impact of confounding.

To quantify the impact of the carbon tariff, I adopt time series analysis to empirically test the China-US tariff-export effect. The Granger causality test shows that the increase in Chinese export quantity is the cause for the United States increase in tariff rate in the long run, but not the opposite way. The Co-integration Analysis and Error Correction Model also predict that the implementation of the carbon tariff is negatively correlated with Chinese social welfare in the short run dynamically, and it will severely decrease the revenue of carbon-intensive industries. Taking environmental influence into account, I advance my model to include stages for the developing country's government to provide a carbon subsidy and firms to innovate low-carbon emission technology. In this sequential game, I derive the condition for developing countries to impose a carbon tariff and the impact of carbon tariff on the environment. Since carbon tariffs may be avoided and ineffective in the long run, I also develop a model of both countries producing a carbon-intensive good together by combining their technology or labor, and Shapley value gives an optimal proportion of the production percentage for each country. For China, it is necessary to develop environmentally-friendly technology as soon as possible. As Stern Review and Nordhaus suggested, the tradable carbon market, carbon tax and industrial policy are all potential methods for the government to improve social welfare and decrease pollution. The role of the carbon tariff could be viewed as an incentive to force the developing countries to break their inertia. Then, in the long run, cooperation can be mutually beneficial for countries to get out of the prisoner dilemma and share their specialized factors of production.",2021-12-03,2025-10-16 11:41:47,2025-10-16 11:41:47,,144-158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2021 2nd International Conference on Big Data Economy and Information Management (BDEIM),,,,Carbon dioxide; Carbon tariff; Developing countries; Developing country; Environment; Games; Government; Production; Tariffs; Time series analysis; Trade barrier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 2nd International Conference on Big Data Economy and Information Management (BDEIM),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Xu,The Optimization of Carbon Emission Prediction in Low Carbon Energy Economy Under Big Data,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3351468,,"With the intensification of global climate change, low-carbon energy has become a hot topic, and governments around the world are implementing corresponding policies to promote its use. This research first establishes a Multi-universe Quantum Harmony Search-Algorithm Dynamic Fuzzy System Ensemble (MUQHS-DMFSE) composite model for carbon emission prediction. This model combines the MUQHS algorithm with the DMFSE method by designing the workflow of the MUQHS algorithm, creating a DMFSE composite prediction model, introducing a sliding factor matrix, and using the MUQHS algorithm to search for the optimal sliding factors, thus obtaining optimized prediction values. In the research on low-carbon economic development, the research applies the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method and establishes Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) and Banker-Charnes-Cooper (BCC) models to assess the technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency, and scale efficiency of decision-making units. This research also uses the BCC model to project the production frontier and calculate input redundancy and output gap rates, and evaluate low-carbon economic development. Through the establishment and application of these two models, the research achieves carbon emission prediction and low-carbon economic analysis, validating the feasibility of the research methodology. The results show that the composite model can effectively predict carbon emissions, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) below 3.5% and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) below 200 tons, demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of the model. The research on low-carbon economic development in S Province based on the DEA method reveals the need for energy structure adjustment, clean and renewable energy promotion, control of carbon emissions, and optimization of industrial structure with a focus on developing the tertiary industry.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example.

However, we will lose privacy if we exchange information without data encryption and communication mechanism security.

Although Asymmetric key encryption deals with the limitations of Symmetric key encryption it can only encrypt limited size of data which is not feasible for a large amount of data files.

Mostly, the focus has been given to optimizing the storage and processing of each workload alone, either geospatial or time dimensions. To close this gap, in this paper, we have designed a pyramid-like indexing scheme that we term as geoTSI (short for geo time series index) which twists two dimensionality reduction geospatial encoding methods (geohash and S2) sequentially with a time series index to efficiently enable such mixed workload scenarios. This method enables geospatial and time indexes to collaborate synergistically in an aim to reduce the time required for accessing the disk and retrieving the time series data that comprises the answer for the mixed workload query. We show how our indexing scheme can be efficiently exploited to run a hybrid geospatial proximity query on time series data. Also, we evaluate our index on real-world georeferenced time series data, where we obtain, on average, a significant 34 % reduction in the query running time by applying our method against the baseline.",2022-05-16,2025-10-16 11:41:47,2025-10-16 11:41:47,,3002-3008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: ICC 2022 - IEEE International Conference on Communications,,,,Big Data; Conferences; Databases; dimension reduction; Dimensionality reduction; Encoding; geospatial indexing; Smart cities; time series; Time series analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ICC 2022 - IEEE International Conference on Communications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Case of the US Consumer Price Index,2025 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (eIT),2154-0373,,10.1109/eIT64391.2025.11103666,,"The consumer price index (CPI) is known as a key macroeconomic indicator for assessing inflation, and accurate predictions of CPI changes over time are significant for a country's economic development. Here, we collected 100+ years (1913–2025) of CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) data (monthly percentage change in CPI value) from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. We employed multiple forecasting models known as SARIMAX, SARIMA rolling forecast, Holt-Winters (HW), Holt-Winters rolling forecast, Facebook prophet (FP), and Facebook prophet rolling forecast to predict historical, current, and future CPI value. Key findings indicated CPI fell by 27.4% (a one-time event in the last 100 years) during the Great Depression of 1929–1933. Also, both original HW and FP models performed best to accurately predict the seasonal variation in CPI numbers during 2014–2025. Finally, the CPI (seasonally adjusted) value would be around 0.467 (all-year high) in January and 0.422 in April 2025, dropping to an all-year low of (-0.005) in November 2025. As per HW forecast, this pattern (a trend in variation of CPI value) of dropping to the lowest CPI in November and reaching peak (highest) in January would be the same for future years (2025–2027). This significant drop in CPI value in November 2025 could have profound implications for economic policies and planning, as it suggests a potential seasonal deflationary trend.

The secondary objective is to assess the congestion nodes and construct a graph based output so as to analyze the trends in traffic flow of kerala state's Ernakulam district during 2 peak hours by considering first peak hour from 7.00 am to 8.30 am and second from 4.00 pm to 6.30 pm. The traffic management and public works department under state government of Kerala can obtain various insights related to congestion nodes. One important intelligence that this project provides is the change in congestion rate of various congestion points with respect to a single road infrastructure project. Even a road-hump or a speed breaker would affect the congestion rate at various congestion points far away. This automated analysis based on machine learning would save public funds by preventing unnecessary allocation of funds. Also this system justifies allocation of funds for various useful projects. The traffic monitoring helps in long term decision making especially while formulating transport policies and budgets. It also guides the law enforcement agencies to properly understand the variations of such traffic and properly take precautionary measures like installation of security cameras and other control measures.,2019-07-17,2025-10-16 11:41:47,2025-10-16 11:41:47,,1482-1488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2019 International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems (ICCES),,,,Big Data; Big Data processing; Electron tubes; IoT sensors; Magnetic sensors; Roads; Smart city; smart transportation; Smart transportation; Traffic congestion; Urban areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems (ICCES),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective of this research is to create a prediction model for vector-borne diseases by making use of several machine learning methodologies. Research into diseases transmitted by vectors encompasses a wide variety of illnesses and is therefore an expansive field. Dengue fever, on the other hand, is the only condition that will be examined in detail within the scope of this study because it has been one of the most common in recent times. The purpose of this research is to offer a prediction model that is capable of diagnosing dengue fever in its early stages from an Indian point of view and also classifying the phases of dengue fever cases that have been clinically proven. The model that has been proposed contains a total of five modules, which are referred to as Data Transformation, Data Pre-processing, Feature scaling & Normalization, Split dataset, and Model Building and Prediction module respectively. The process of transforming the data has been completed in the first module. The processes of data preprocessing, feature scaling, and normalization of the dataset were carried out in the second module.

Meanwhile, there were thousands of unconfirmed sightings of Vespa Mandarinia, including dates, locations, pictures and descriptions. In order to help the Washington State Government more effectively control the Vespa Mandarinia intrusion. We built a model to predict the intrusion trend of Vespa Mandarinia and analyse whether the reports submitted by the public are valid. On the basis of the linear correlation coefficient of time and propagation distance, we used particle swarm optimization algorithm to get the initial position of invasion. Since the accuracy of the eyewitness reports provided by the public was uneven, we adopted a comprehensive evaluation model of score, and used three variates, including Distance score, Text score and Image score, to evaluate the credibility of eyewitness reports. Prioritizing major eyewitness reports was finally determined. Finally, the optimal time interval for updating the evaluation model is determined by calculating the linear correlation coefficient. As a result, we have a mathematical model that can effectively simulate biological invasions of Vespa Mandarinia and determine whether eyewitness reports are credible. It can be an effective tool for biological invasion control in Washington State. In this paper, the trend of biological invasion and the credibility of eyewitness reports are quantitatively described by mathematical model tools, which provides new ideas and methods for biological invasion control.",2022-10-28,2025-10-16 11:41:47,2025-10-16 11:41:47,,730-739,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2022 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Computer Application (ICDSCA),,,,biological invasion; Biological system modeling; comprehensive evaluation model of score; Computational modeling; Correlation coefficient; Government; linear correlation coefficient; Market research; Mathematical models; particle swarm optimization; Predictive models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Computer Application (ICDSCA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some recommendations are also given. First of all, the country should improve the law to protect the shareholders of listed companies. Secondly, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) should increase the punishment to the companies that make fake products. The possibility of fraud can be reduced only when the amount of punishment a company receives after fraud is greater than the profit of fraud. In addition, the CSRC should improve the system of broker market. If a public company falsifies its accounting, its brokers should be denied the right to work for another company or to start a company again and go public. Finally, the state should improve the independence of board department. For the accounting department, since the scale of accounting companies on the market is small and they need long-term financial support from customers, the company may threaten to cancel long-term cooperation or make accounting fraud by bribery. This situation can be improved by government intervention such as arranging directors by CSRC and giving subsidies to accounting departments.",2023-09-11,2025-10-16 11:41:47,2025-10-16 11:41:47,,490-497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2023 International Conference on Telecommunications, Electronics and Informatics (ICTEI)",,,,Analytical models; Companies; Computational modeling; Data models; Dynamic replication equation; Evolutionary stable strategy; Finance; Game analysis model; Games; Jacobian matrix; Logistic model; Mathematical models; mixed strategy equilibrium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023 International Conference on Telecommunications, Electronics and Informatics (ICTEI)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The advent of 5G technology holds significant promise for advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in India. The potential impacts of 5G deployment on various aspects of sustainable development include focusing on economic growth, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and governance. Hence, it is imperative to measure the 5G coverage evenly across the country to make sure that no one is left behind to benefit from development i.e. ensuring equitable justice. However, there is currently no method or tool for precise real-time monitoring of telecom technology (2G/3G/4G/5G) and Quality of Service (QoS) for individuals on the ground, resulting in a large portion of the population without reliable telecom connectivity.This paper proposes a methodology and tools to measure ground-level QoS, which the Indian Government can use to take proactive steps to provide high-quality telecom coverage to all citizens, focus on strategic areas, and achieve the goals of the National Digital Communication Policy-2018. The created smartphone app collects data from volunteers using scalable server architecture. Along with signal data, topographical, meteorological, and mobile tower data will be used.

With the implementation of the above strategies, the construction of relevant city assessment tools is essential. However, the assessment framework of urban sustainability focuses on the aspect of environment and society, while smart city puts emphasis on economic and social indicators. Therefore, integrating the two concepts as “Smart Sustainable City” and constructing a related evaluation model would be more comprehensive. Moreover, the development of “Big Data” theory allows city planners to interpret and apply large amounts of data collected from various sources. Under this opportunity, the result of analyzing the actual big data to forecast the variance ratio of each indicator can be used as the objective basis to construct the model, which can increase the accuracy of the city assessment. Based on the big data analysis, this paper will construct an assessment framework of smart sustainable city in line with the future situation, and further conduct the model validation through city evaluation. First, this paper reviews the concepts and assessment framework of sustainable development and smart city in order to sum up the appropriate indicators to construct the model, and applies “Fuzzy Delphi Technique (FDT)” to select the indicators which are considered important regarding the smart sustainable city. In addition, “Data Mining” and “Analytic Network Process (ANP)” are used to predict the future variance ratio of smart sustainable city indicators and to apply the variance ratio regarding the future scenario to determine their weights. Finally, this paper will conduct an empirical analysis by assessing the smart sustainable level of cities, hoping to validate the model and propose related suggestions to promote the idea exchange of urban development.",2018-06-28,2025-10-16 11:41:47,2025-10-16 11:41:47,,1-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2018 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE),,,,Big Data; Indexes; Smart cities; Sustainable development; Technological innovation; Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, decision of social and public opinions, and polarity about social happenings, political issues, government policies and decision, or commercial products is very important to the government, company, and a person. But, SNS are basically making newly-coined words and emoticons. Especially, emoticons are made by a person or companies. Newly-coined words are mostly made by communities. The SNS big data mainly consists of his kinds of newly-coined words and emoticons so that newly-coined words and emoticons analysis are very important to understand the social and public opinions, and polarity about social happenings, political issues, government policies and decision, or commercial products. Social big data is unstructured data and contains many newly-coined words and various emoticons. Therefore, there is a limitation to guarantee the accuracy and analysis range of social data of emotional analysis. The newly-coined words contains the social phenomena and trends of modern society implicitly. And the emoticons are electronic quasi-languages made up of letters and symbols, and express the emotional state more implicitly. Although the newly-coined words and emoticons are an important part of the emotional analysis, they are excluded from the emotional dictionary and analysis. In this research, newly-coined words and emoticons extracted from the raw twit messages include polarity and weight with pre-built dictionary. The polarity and weight would be calculated for emotional classification. The proposed emotional classification equation adds up the weights among the same polarity(positive or negative) and sums the negative weight value with the positive weight values. The polarity summation result is recorded in the variable. If the polarity summation result is more than threshold value, the twit message is decided as positive. If it is less than threshold value, it is decided as negative and the other values are decided as neutral.

In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a construction scheme of the smart government affairs big data platform based on the Adaptive Decomposition and Filtering Framework (TimeADF). TimeADF solves the problems of high-frequency detail capture and long-term trend prediction of multi-source heterogeneous data through a three-stage design of reversible feature Reconstruction (RevIN), Frequency decomposition module (FDB), and high-frequency selector (ChooseK). Specifically, first normalize the multi-scale data using RevIN to ensure the integrity of cross-scale information; Then, through the Fourier transform, the low-frequency and medium-frequency components are separated by the FDB module, and the high-frequency components are calculated by the residuals, thereby dynamically screening the low-frequency policy cycle and high-frequency emergencies. The first k hidden high-frequency signals are extracted by the ChooseK module, and the hidden high-frequency information in the medium and low-frequency components is extracted for the second time. Because high-frequency information is more likely to predict the trends of certain government data in the future and enhance the sensitivity of prediction. Therefore, after superimposing the two high-frequency components and inputting them into FFN, the predictive output is achieved, accurately capturing the high-frequency details and long-term trends of government data. We conducted model checking on six datasets related to electricity, weather, financial transactions, etc. The prediction lengths covered {96, 192, 336, 720}. The results showed that TimeADF increased by an average of 39.8% and 24.7% respectively on MSE and MAE.

Energy management, which is one of the smart city layers, has also been experiencing cyberattacks. Furthermore, the Distributed Energy Resources (DER), which depend on different controllers to provide energy to the main physical smart grid of a smart city, is prone to cyberattacks. The increased cyber-attacks on DER systems are mainly because of its dependency on digital communication and controls as there is an increase in the number of devices owned and controlled by consumers and third parties. This paper analyzes the major cyber security and privacy challenges that might inflict, damage or compromise the DER and related controllers in smart cities. These challenges highlight that the security and privacy on the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, and smart grid, which are the building blocks of a smart city, must be addressed in the DER sector. It is observed that the security and privacy challenges in smart cities can be solved through the distributed framework, by identifying and classifying stakeholders, using appropriate model, and by incorporating fault-tolerance techniques.",2022-03-23,2025-10-16 11:41:47,2025-10-16 11:41:47,,788-792,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2022 9th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom),,,,cyber security; cyberattacks; distributed energy resources; Distributed power generation; energy management systems; Fault tolerant systems; Maintenance engineering; Privacy; Security; smart cities; Smart cities; Smart grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022 9th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Innovators of smart service systems,  including entrepreneurs, managers, and policymakers seek to improve quality-of-service for customers,  quality-of-life for citizens, and/or quality-of-returns for investors. Smart service systems are ones that continuously improve (e.g., productivity, quality, compliance, sustainability, etc.) and co-evolve with all sectors (e.g., government, healthcare, education, finance, retail and hospitality, communication, energy, utilities, transportation, etc.). Regional service systems include nations, states, cities, universities, and hospitals.. Global service systems include multi-national businesses, professional associations, and NGOs. Natural or human-made disasters, technology failures, criminal activities, political collapse can disrupt or negatively impact quality-of-life for people living and working in service systems. Using big data analytics and cognitive systems to improve decision-making service providers try to compete for the hearts, minds, and wallets of collaborators by (1) improving existing offerings, (2) innovating new types of offerings, (3) evolving their portfolio of offerings, and, (4) changing their relationships to others in the ecosystem in ways stakeholders perceive as more positive, sustainable, fair, or responsible.

Despite bringing new opportunities, big data encounters the challenges such as extremely large number of observations (e.g., Millions of transactions), high dimensionality (e.g., Thousands of items), and immediate response. Taking big data into consideration, the conventional association analysis is frustrated by the extraction of patterns information. Specifically, the computational complexity of frequent item sets mining increases exponentially by the number of items, which has been proven to be an NP-Complete problem. Although many studies used a pruning-patterns strategy to reduce the complexity, it probably distorts the shape of data and incurs inaccurate result. In this paper, we introduce relative patterns discovery (named RPD) that explores the same patterns between each two observations. To show that RPD is a pragmatic solution toward big data analytics, we design a scalable outlier detection method (named SOD) based on the concept of RPD. Particularly, SOD can score the anomaly without enumerate all the relative patterns. The empirical investigations, conducted with various real-world datasets, demonstrate that SOD performs well even in the environment of large number of observations and high dimensionality.",2015-10-23,2025-10-16 11:42:01,2025-10-16 11:42:01,,401-407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on e-Business Engineering,,,,Association analysis; big data; Big data; Complexity theory; data mining; Data mining; Government; Itemsets; Media; outlier detection; Real-time systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on e-Business Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, this paper presents a big data science and engineering solution for transit performance analytics in the area of transportation analysis. The insights derived from this data analysis are instrumental in enhancing the performance of public transportation, ultimately leading to an improved commuter experience in the city and contributing to the development of a smart city. To elaborate, our solution employs frequent pattern mining to identify variations in transit performance across different neighborhoods. By uncovering significant patterns, we establish connections that help us pinpoint the factors contributing to bus delays in specific areas. Improving the accuracy of bus arrival and departure times can significantly enhance the overall usability and appeal of public transit for commuters, as people are more likely to rely on buses when they are punctual and ensure timely arrivals at their destinations.

Governments around the world encourage big data sharing and trading to flourish the big data economics. However, existing data trading platforms are not fully trusted. Data providers lack control over data trading rights. Meanwhile, the data price model needs further justification. These issues hinder the development of big data trading. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized data trading platform, on which data providers can better control data trading. Accordingly, we design smart contracts for distributed data trading and set rules to assign data rewards in trading. The contract guarantees the efficiency of data matching and fair reward distribution. We also adopt proxy re-encryption to ensure the security of data transmission. We verify the security, availability, and efficiency of the proposed big data trading platform.",2020-07-06,2025-10-16 11:42:01,2025-10-16 11:42:01,,991-996,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: IEEE INFOCOM 2020 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS),,,,Big Data; Big data trading; Blockchain; Contracts; Cryptography; Data models; Distributed databases; Proxy re-encryption; Smart contract; Value reward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE INFOCOM 2020 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant volumes of data are generated from the communication between a large numbers of heterogeneous devices over the Internet. Big data technology is generally used to handle the large volume of data. Complex networks are graphs (networks) having non-trivial topological features, such as random graphs and lattices. Big data of complex networks concerns big data methods that can be used to analyze massive structural data sets, including considerably large networks and sets of graphs. This study is based on the critical phenomenon arising in complex networks that enable us to analytically predict the hotspots in smart cities. Hotspots are places with significantly high communication traffic relative to others. In this study, we propose a cyber-physical-social system for the analysis of high communication traffic hotspots using telecom data. The proposed model constructs a graph, and perform social network analysis on it. The process of hotspot extraction is performed, followed by social network analysis, which is conducted by quantifying the importance of each hotspot based on network metrics. These metrics aid in determining the importance of each hotspot in a telecom data network. Our objective is to prioritize different areas and detect hotspots quickly.

These problems faced by cities and countries are tried to be solved in the concept of smart cities and intelligent transportation by using information and communication technologies in line with the needs. While designing intelligent transportation systems (ITS), beyond traditional methods, big data should be designed in a state-of-the-art and appropriate way with the help of methods such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. In this study, a data-driven decision support system model was established to help the business make strategic decisions with the help of intelligent transportation data and to contribute to the elimination of public transportation problems in the city. Our study model has been established using big data technologies and business intelligence technologies: a decision support system including data sources layer, data ingestion/ collection layer, data storage and processing layer, data analytics layer, application/presentation layer, developer layer, and data management/ data security layer stages. In our study, the decision support system was modeled using ITS data supported by big data technologies, where the traditional structure could not find a solution.

Zhong,Firework: Big Data Sharing and Processing in Collaborative Edge Environment,2016 Fourth IEEE Workshop on Hot Topics in Web Systems and Technologies (HotWeb),,,10.1109/HotWeb.2016.12,,"Cloud computing, arguably, has become the de facto computing platform for the big data processing by researchers and practitioners for the last decade, and enabled different stakeholders to discover valuable information from large scale data. At the same time, in the decade, we have witnessed the fast growing deployment of billions of sensors and actuators in multiple applications domains, such as transportation, manufacturing, connected/wearable health care, smart city and so on, stimulating the emerging of Edge Computing (a.k.a., fog computing, cloudlet). However, data, as the core of both cloud computing and edge computing, is still owned by each stakeholder and rarely shared due to privacy concern and formidable cost of data transportation, which significantly limits Internet of Things (IoT) applications that need data input from multiple stakeholders (e.g., video analytics collects data from cameras owned by police department, transportation department, retailer stores, etc.). In this paper, we envision that in the era of IoT the demand of distributed big data sharing and processing applications will dramatically increase since the data producing and consuming are pushed to the edge of the network. Data processing in collaborative edge environment needs to fuse data owned by multiple stakeholders, while keeping the computation within stakeholders' data facilities. To attack this challenge, we propose a new computing paradigm, Firework, which is designed for big data processing in collaborative edge environment (CEE). Firework fuses geographically distributed data by creating virtual shared data views that are exposed to end users via predefined interfaces by data owners. The interfaces are provided in the form of a set of datasets and a set of functions, where the functions are privacy preserved and bound to the datasets. Firework targets to share data while ensuring data privacy and integrity for stakeholders. By pushing the data processing as close as to data sources, Firework also aims to avoid data movement from the edge of the network to the cloud and improve the response latency.",2016-10-24,2025-10-16 11:42:01,2025-10-16 11:42:01,,20-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2016 Fourth IEEE Workshop on Hot Topics in Web Systems and Technologies (HotWeb),,,,Big Data; Cloud computing; Data privacy; Data processing; Distributed databases; Edge computing; Internet of Things; Registers; Stakeholders; Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016 Fourth IEEE Workshop on Hot Topics in Web Systems and Technologies (HotWeb),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the stochastic and massive nature of big data, the existing literature often relies on artificial intelligence techniques based on information theory. As a new approach, this paper presents a knowledge extraction method based on an analysis of Seoul Metro's 'untraceable' ridership big data. Without identification information, the untraceable ridership data only shows the hourly accumulation of station entry and exit information. To reconstruct the missing information in the data set, this study proposes a fluid dynamics model and adopts a heuristic genetic algorithm based on optimization theory as the problem solver. The result of our model presents the distribution of the elapsed time defined on an hourly basis taken until a passenger returns to the station they departed from. To validate our model, we acquired subway ridership data with passengers' identification with permission from Seoul Metro. This paper presents two novel aspects of subway ridership, namely the dependency on departure time and the discrepancy between weekend and weekday traffic. Our analytical approach contributes to solving the problem of extracting hidden knowledge from big collection of data missing critical information, e.g., constantly and autonomously gathered data fragments from numerous gateways in smart cities.",2020,2025-10-16 11:42:01,2025-10-16 11:42:01,,69296-69310,,,8,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big Data; data mining; Data mining; Data models; genetic algorithm (GA); Genetic algorithms; harmony search algorithm; Inverse problem; mass conservation law; optimization; outdoor duration time; Public transportation; Seoul metro subway ridership; Smart cities; wave decomposition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ozone is considered as one of the most air pollutants with hurtful impact to human health. Existing methods used to predict the level of ozone uses shallow pollution prediction models and are still unsatisfactory in their accuracy to be used in many real-world applications. In order to increase the accuracy of prediction models we come up with the concept of using deep architecture models tested on big pollution and weather data. In this paper, a new deep learning-based ozone level prediction model is proposed, which considers the pollution and weather correlations integrally. This deep learning model is used to learn ozone level features, and it is trained using a grid search technique. A deep architecture model is utilized to represent ozone level features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for ozone level prediction has superior performance.

However, existing sentiment computing methods are mainly based on the standard emotion thesaurus or supervised methods, which are not scalable to the social media big data. Therefore, we propose an innovative method to do the sentiment computing for news events. More specially, based on the social media data (i.e., words and emoticons) of a news event, a word emotion association network (WEAN) is built to jointly express its semantic and emotion, which lays the foundation for the news event sentiment computation. Based on WEAN, a word emotion computation algorithm is proposed to obtain the initial words emotion, which are further refined through the standard emotion thesaurus. With the words emotion in hand, we can compute every sentence's sentiment.

As the implementation of the Master Plan for the Construction of Hainan Free Trade Port, many ocean-going ships and shipping companies choose to register in Hainan, resulting in a significant increase in the demand for ship-related talents. For a long time, China has implemented strict registration system for ships, which only registration of vessels owned by local residents or companies are allowed. As a result, more than 2000 units of Chinese-funded international sailing ships choose to register in countries allowing open registration and fly flags of convenience for easier registration and taxes preference. On June 1, 2020, the Chinese government released the Master Plan for the Construction of Hainan Free Trade Port, putting forward to building more liberal shipping system in Hainan, China. Hainan Free Trade Port International Ship Registry Center has been established in order to facilitate ocean-going ships to register in Hainan with ""Yangpu, China"" as the registry port, and to attract Chinese-funded vessels under flags of convenience or foreign-funded vessels to register in Hainan.This paper uses descriptive analysis with the big data worldwide of commercial ships of 1000 GT and above released by United Nations Committee on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 2019 to find out the general condition of Chinese-funded vessels in order to make a prediction of shipping talents demand in Hainan Free Trade Port.The descriptive analysis of big data is the analysis of various characteristics of a set of data in order to describe the characteristics of the measurement sample and the overall characteristics it represents, and to reveal the characteristics with charts, curves and other visual methods, provide advice and reference to user when making decision.The descriptive big data analysis shows that there are 34.91% of Chinese-funded ocean-going ships flying the flag of convenience, while the tonnage of those vessels accounts for 55.9% in 2019. The result reveals that a large number of Chinese-funded ships are sailing under the flag of convenience. The state promptly formulated the ""master plan"" including to establish international registration system so as to attract Chinese-funded ships to return and register in Hainan. In fact, the latest statistic shows the trend of returning of those Chinese-funded ship is obvious since the implementation of the plan. As a result, the free trade port needs a large number of shipping talents, including seafarers, shore-based management personnel, and other ship-related professionals. However, the cultivation scale of ship-related talents in Hainan cannot meet the huge demand for shipping talents caused by increasing registration of international trading ships and companies.This paper proposed a demand-orientated cultivation mode for shipping talents in higher vocational education in the view of serving the development of local economy under the background of Hainan Free Trade Port.",2021-11-26,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,1018-1023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2021 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Education (ICISE-IE),,,,Big Data; big data analysis; Companies; demand-Orientated Talent Cultivation Mode; Education; Hainan Free Trade Port; Higher Vocational Education; Sea measurements; Seaports; the descriptive analysis; Trade agreements; Visualization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Education (ICISE-IE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the popularity of smart phones and the unprecedented growth of mobile phone data, there emerge numerous studies on land use detection with CDR (Call Detail Records), SMS (Short Messaging Service) and mobile traffic data. This is also a combination of urban sensing based on mobile big data and smart city construction. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on existing studies on land use detection with CDR, text data, and mobile traffic data. We propose a new traffic signature that combines the advantages of the above studies and apply it to a real-world dataset collected in northeast of China. We choose the POI (point of interest) data as ground truth data that the obtained land use types are compared with. We find that our method can accurately detect the POI collections of specific types, which proves the effectiveness of our method.

Despite all the progress already made, the vast majority of solutions have not met the requirements of Applications’ Runtime, Development, and Deployment when related to Scalability. Some studies point out that just 1 of 97 (1%) reported platforms reach this all this set of requirements at same time. This small number of platforms may be explained by some reasons: i) Big Data: The huge amount of processed and stored data with various data sources and data types, ii) Multi-domains: many domains involved (Economy, Traffic, Health, Security, Agronomy, etc.), iii) Multiple processing methods like Data Flow, Batch Processing, Services, and Microservices, and 4) High Distributed Degree: The use of multiple IoT and BigData tools combined with execution at various computational levels (Edge, Fog, Cloud) leads applications to present a high level of distribution. Aware of those great challenges, we propose Sapparchi, an integrated architectural model for Smart Cities applications that defines multi-processing levels (Edge, Fog, and Cloud).

However, the computation cost in the cloud can be unexpectedly high if it cannot be managed properly. The long tail phenomenon has been observed widely in the big data clustering area, which indicates that the majority of time is often consumed in the middle to late stages in the clustering process. In this research, we try to cut the unnecessary long tail in the clustering process to achieve a sufficiently satisfactory accuracy at the lowest possible computation cost. A novel approach is proposed to achieve cost-effective big data clustering in the cloud. By training the regression model with the sampling data, we can make widely used k-means and EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithms stop automatically at an early point when the desired accuracy is obtained. Experiments are conducted on four popular data sets and the results demonstrate that both k-means and EM algorithms can achieve high cost-effectiveness in the cloud with our proposed approach. For example, in the case studies with the much more efficient k-means algorithm, we find that achieving a 99 percent accuracy needs only 47.71-71.14 percent of the computation cost required for achieving a 100 percent accuracy while the less efficient EM algorithm needs 16.69-32.04 percent of the computation cost.

Even the same device can be used in variety of ways, let alone different devices. Besides the user generated data, there is also machine generated data, which can have a more foreseeable pattern, like nightly backups or scheduled tasks, but usually imply more CPU or I/O intensive tasks than the sporadic ones generated by human users. In a context where the analyzed data size is constantly increasing and we start to talk about Big Data in more and more daily tasks, we need a way to handle all these diverse tasks that serve a variety of purposes. Some of this data must be sometimes analyzed as fast as possible, or, in some cases the analysis can be done at the end of the day, as part of a batch process.

Traffic congestion, pollutant emissions, energy consumption are some of the problems related to urban mobility. Therefore, there is the need of tools able to support decision-makers in studying, evaluating, and planning sustainable urban evolutions. A few open-source and proprietary solutions are available requiring on-premises installations, large effort, and providing limited capabilities to actually handle real-time data (from data spaces, and standards). Moreover, they are limited in terms of analytic integration and do not offer automatic generation of suggestions. In practice they do not manage the explosion of complexity regarding computational and storage/models aspects. For these reasons, this paper presents a comprehensive architecture for a Smart City Digital Twin platform, specifically designed to support mobility and transportation decision-making through advanced what-if analysis and optimization.

Furthermore, machine learning (ML) has been used to a range of networking issues, such as resource allocation, routing, traffic engineering, and security. Despite the abundance of research on big data analytics and machine learning, there is a lack of specialized studies on the development of machine learning techniques for large-scale data analysis in the Internet of Things healthcare space. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis with a focus on big data analysis in the healthcare sector using machine learning techniques. It discusses a number of research questions and evaluates existing approaches, including the benefits and drawbacks of each. This project aims to educate government agencies and healthcare professionals on the latest advancements in machine learning (ML)-based data analytics for cognitive healthcare systems..",2024-09-20,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,1580-1585,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2024 International Conference on Communication, Computing and Energy Efficient Technologies (I3CEET)",,,,5 V model; Big Data; big data analytics; Data analysis; Decision making; decision-making; Internet of Things; iot-enabled healthcare; Machine learning; machine learning survey; Medical services; ML methods and privacy issues; networking problems; Surveys; Telecommunication computing; Wearable devices; wearables; wireless sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2024 International Conference on Communication, Computing and Energy Efficient Technologies (I3CEET)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Out of all the next technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) could radically alter the way marketers approach their craft. Artificial intelligence has the potential to be useful in many areas of today's business world. There is widespread agreement among scholars and industry professionals that AI will ultimately determine humanity's fate. The growth of communication and information technologies has turned the entire planet into an interconnected web of nodes. Investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have skyrocketed with the purpose of delivering corporate intelligence through the analysis of massive amounts of data, thanks to technological solutions. Contrary to popular belief, AI is not only used extensively in the IT industry. It is also heavily utilised in healthcare, online shopping, schools, government, and businesses. More and more companies are relying on AI systems. Experts from all over the world are trying to figure out which AI technologies would work best for their advertising initiatives. Notwithstanding this, many businesses fail to realise any returns from their investments in big data analytics. In this study, we investigate the correlation between innovation performance, AI-driven big data analytics, and strategic agility as well as market volatility.

With the support of big data analytics, conventional intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are gradually changing into data-driven ITS (D2 ITS). Along with traffic growth, D2ITS need to solve more real-life problems, including the issue of unlicensed taxis and their identification, which potentially disrupts the taxi business sector and endangers society safety. As a remedy to this issue, a smart model is proposed in this paper to identify unlicensed taxis. The proposed model consists of two submodel components, namely, candidate selection model and candidate refined model. The former is used to screen out a coarse-grained suspected unlicensed taxi candidate list. The list is taken as an input for the candidate refined model, which is based on machine learning to get a fine-grained list of suspected unlicensed taxis. The proposed model is evaluated using real-life data, and the obtained results are encouraging, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in identifying unlicensed taxis, helping governments to better regulate the traffic operation and reduce associated costs.",2016-06,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,1703-1713,,6,17,,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big data; Data models; data-driven ITS; intelligent transportation systems; Licenses; machine learning; Public transportation; Real-time systems; unlicensed taxi; Vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google BigQuery pricing is based on the size of the data being stored or queried, but given that RDF statements contain long Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), the cost of query and storage of RDF big data can increase rapidly. In this paper we present and evaluate a novel and efficient dictionary compression algorithm which is faster, generates small dictionaries that can fit in memory and results in better compression rate when compared with other large scale RDF dictionary compression.

Under the background of the increasing substitution of online retail for traditional offline retail, this mechanism will exacerbate the disparity of regional tax revenue, and intensify tax competition among local governments. Therefore, reconsidering the allocation mechanism of value-added tax in China can be an important policy decision, and it is influenced by various economic and social factors. Firstly, we utilize large-scale retail transaction data from an e-commerce platform to measure regional disparities in retail and consumption among different regions and then reveals present tax policy results in revenue imbalance in different regions. Secondly, we establish a model based on game theory to illustrate how the origin principle leads to fierce tax competition among regions. Furthermore, by establishing and solving tax allocation models between local governments and the central government, this study simulates and calculates the degree of revenue imbalance under different scenarios and attempts to propose policy measures. The results indicate that implementing the destination principle will reduce regional tax imbalances. Moreover, adjusting the allocation ratio between the central government and local governments based on city levels is advantageous for further reducing regional tax revenue disparities.",2024-03,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,46-57,,1,5,,Journal of Social Computing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big Data; destination principle; e-commerce; Finance; Local government; origin principle; Resource management; Social computing; Social factors; Urban areas; value-added tax,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOESIS, funded under EU H2020 program, aims to design a decision supported tool by gathering and analyzing these applications as use cases to formulate sufficient knowledge for policy makers to make informed decisions for their big data transport applications. The challenges in this work are associated with a small number of samples, with incomplete information, but having a good size of features that need to be analyzed to make a confident enough recommendation.

It is reflected in e-government, government robots and data governance. The application of AI in governance requires a rational examination of several questions: Who is responsible? To whom? What is responsibility? And how to responsible for? Through the study, the following understandings are obtained: first, the artificial intelligence participating in government governance cannot assume administrative responsibility as the administrative subject because it does not have the sense of autonomy. Second, artificial intelligence based on big data and cloud computing has developed a new ""human-computer interaction"" relationship with human beings. In the future, the public and the government themselves should be included in the scope of the responsible objects of artificial intelligence. Third, due to the immature development of artificial intelligence, its existing technical loopholes are easy to cause the security risk of government data and personal privacy data leakage. Fourth, to develop responsible artificial intelligence and improve the effectiveness of government governance, we need to start from responsibility awareness, regulatory system, ethical norms and legal policies.",2021-06-18,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,76-80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education (ICAIE),,,,artificial intelligence; Education; Government; government governance; Human computer interaction; Law; Process control; responsibility; Security; technology revolution; Tools,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education (ICAIE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cloud computing is the optimal technology that provides many computing resources, especially storage for Big data. Cloud offers the best storage management to back up the big data from IoT, business, enterprise, or government. All data owners want the protection of their own data, so they encrypt the data before outsourcing data in clouds. As many users avail cloud storage, different users may outsource the same data with different encryption techniques, and it results in data duplication or data redundancy. Although cloud computing offers a huge amount of storage space, data duplication decreases the efficiency and performance of cloud storage, and also it results in poor data management and the requirement of high bandwidth. The deduplication technique is used to manage data duplication in clouds. Although there are some deduplication approaches used to avoid data redundancy, still they have lack efficiency. The main aim of this paper is to obtain sufficient knowledge and a good idea about deduplication techniques by surveying existing approaches and this work may help the researcher and practitioner for their future research in developing efficient cloud storage management techniques.",2021-04-08,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,976-983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2021 5th International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication (ICCMC),,,,Bandwidth; Big data; Big Data; Cloud computing; Cloud storage; Data deduplication; Data duplication; data management; Government; IoT; Memory; Redundancy; Storage management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 5th International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication (ICCMC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysing vessel movements provides insights into fishing dynamics, aiding decision-making. Additionally, measuring unmonitored fishing activity (hidden fishing) helps counteract the underestimation of fishing pressure. Big data analysis can reveal fishing patterns and hidden activities from vessel position and speed data, such as those transmitted by fleets carrying Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). We used an Open Science-compliant (reproducible, repeatable, and reusable) cloud computing-based big data analysis to estimate the manifest, total, and hidden fishing distributions of AIS-carrying vessels in the Mediterranean Sea from 2017 to 2022, processing about 1.6 billion vessel speed and position data. We estimated the principal hotspots of hidden fishing over the years and the potentially involved stocks from these data. We also assessed whether the hotspots corresponded to illegal fishing or AIS communication issues and concluded that most hotspots potentially corresponded to illegal fishing. Our manifest fishing distribution agreed with another produced through machine learning by the Global Fishing Watch.

Companies are increasingly adopting sustainable practices in their supply chains due to mounting pressure from consumers, governments, and investors. These may be different strategies to minimize environmental impact, ensure prospective economic stability, or contribute to the social well-being of vulnerable groups of people. This report applies the semi-systematic literature review method to explore the potential of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics (BDA) technologies to improve sustainability in supply chains. AI and BDA are increasingly asserting themselves as leading solutions for the sustainability of today’s complex supply chains. They affect the three main dimensions of supply chain sustainability— environmental, social, and economic. Thanks to AI, companies make more accurate forecasts, more efficient production and logistics models, and, as a result, minimize stocks, waste, and excess production, reduce fuel consumption, and reduce harmful emissions. Big data (BD) and BDA technologies increase the quality of management decisions and contribute to improving the consistency and transparency of processes in complex supply chains. Despite the very good start, the implementation of AI and BD to achieve supply chain sustainability requires serious research. This implementation is still in its early stages of development and has faced several challenges. At the current stage, results have been achieved in terms of economic sustainability, and more serious ones are expected in other areas as well.",2024-12-04,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,1-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2024 7th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technologies and Networking (CommNet),,,,Artificial intelligence; Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Big Data Analytics; Business; Companies; Economics; Production; Supply Chain; Supply chains; Sustainability of Supply Chain; Sustainable development; Turning; Uncertainty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024 7th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technologies and Networking (CommNet),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The law and policy program (D-DCRCLPP) of the data-to-decisions cooperative research center provides examples of the various ways that regulation affects the economy and, in turn, living standards. As a result, only a limited amount of capital, labor, and technology may be used in the production process. Regulation, when done incorrectly, has the potential to stifle innovation and learning while also limiting opportunities for everyone. Big Data technology (BDT) has been studied, with a focus on privacy and data protection techniques, which led to the formulation of this policy proposal based on privacy law (PL). Several perspectives are provided, each with benefits and weaknesses. These perspectives come from the domains of governance, law, economics, and information science. Enormous, linked, and information sharing are multifaceted ways that necessitate the use of a variety of technologies to promote and protect people's economic and political rights. Existing and emerging rules of international economic law have an indirect impact on such projects. New regulations for digital commerce are meant to ensure global data mobility. At the same time, international investment law will most likely be used to defend governments attempting to compel data sharing from private data holders. For these reasons, international economic law limits governments' ability to cope with asymmetric data ownership while promoting information holders' right to preserve control over data placement and utilization.

The time required for a given trajectory in a transportation system can be accurately estimated using the trajectory data of the taxis in a city. This is a very challenging task. Although historical data have been used in existing research, excessive use of trajectory information in historical data or inaccurate neighbor trajectory information does not allow for a better prediction accuracy of the query trajectory. In this article, we propose a deep learning method based on neighbors for travel time estimation (TTE), called the Nei-TTE method. We divide the entire trajectory into multiple disjoint segments and use the historical trajectory data approximated at the time level. Our model captures the characteristics of each segment and utilizes the trajectory characteristics of adjacent segments as the road network topology and speed interact. We use velocity features to effectively represent adjacent segment structures.

Location intelligence applications aim at exploiting those geo-referenced data in generating visualizations and dashboards that provide deep insights for assisting decision making in smart cities and urban planning. As data arriving are mostly geo-referenced and the rate is fluctuating in pace and skewness, computations upon streams should depend on approximation by applying methods such as sampling. Representativeness in sampling designs remains the pivotal concern in the literature. In spatial data streams contexts, it loosely means selecting proportional counts of spatial tuples from each group of tuples that belong to the same real geometry (i.e., geographically residing in the same proximity) within each streaming time window. This is challenging in streaming settings because spatial data is parametrized, loosing hence it is real geometries, which requires costly geometric operations to project them back to maps. To close this void, we have designed SpatialSPE in a previous work and incorporated an efficient fine-grained spatial online sampling method (SAOS) transparently within its layers.

On planning an integrated city, data captured from the infrastructures within a city can be analyzed and utilized for effective resource and services provisions within the city. In urban mobility, automated planning and demand responsive to public transportation integrated with self-driven vehicles. On safety, security and health of cities and their citizens, real-time surveillance and analytics can lead to better provision of emergency services, weather planning, early warnings on floods, tornadoes, man-made disasters and pandemics. To facilitate such services requires frameworks that can be effective at acquisition, processing and analysis of large volumes of data from vast systems as well as citizens within a city while preserving the security and privacy of data sources. In this paper, (a) a brief overview on the current landscape on smart cities is provided, the architectures and frameworks proposed to support data management, (b) highlights research opportunities that are still open, (c) proposes a privacy preserving computation framework that can be explored for a robust smart city ecosystem (d) and outlines the benefits possible with such a proposed framework.",2020-12-14,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,1096-1103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE 22nd International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 18th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 6th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),,,,Data privacy; Intelligent Buildings; IoT Architectures; Planning; Privacy Preserving Frameworks; Real-time systems; Smart buildings; Smart Buildings IoT; Smart cities; Smart Cities; Surveillance; Tornadoes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020 IEEE 22nd International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 18th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 6th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alamri,Mining Human Activity Patterns From Smart Home Big Data for Health Care Applications,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2719921,,"Nowadays, there is an ever-increasing migration of people to urban areas. Health care service is one of the most challenging aspects that is greatly affected by the vast influx of people to city centers. Consequently, cities around the world are investing heavily in digital transformation in an effort to provide healthier ecosystems for people. In such a transformation, millions of homes are being equipped with smart devices (e.g., smart meters, sensors, and so on), which generate massive volumes of fine-grained and indexical data that can be analyzed to support smart city services. In this paper, we propose a model that utilizes smart home big data as a means of learning and discovering human activity patterns for health care applications. We propose the use of frequent pattern mining, cluster analysis, and prediction to measure and analyze energy usage changes sparked by occupants' behavior. Since people's habits are mostly identified by everyday routines, discovering these routines allows us to recognize anomalous activities that may indicate people's difficulties in taking care for themselves, such as not preparing food or not using a shower/bath. This paper addresses the need to analyze temporal energy consumption patterns at the appliance level, which is directly related to human activities. For the evaluation of the proposed mechanism, this paper uses the U.K. Domestic Appliance Level Electricity data set-time series data of power consumption collected from 2012 to 2015 with the time resolution of 6 s for five houses with 109 appliances from Southern England. The data from smart meters are recursively mined in the quantum/data slice of 24 h, and the results are maintained across successive mining exercises. The results of identifying human activity patterns from appliance usage are presented in detail in this paper along with the accuracy of shortand long-term predictions.",2017,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,13131-13141,,,5,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,association rules; behavioral analytics; Big data; cluster analysis; Data mining; frequent pattern; health care applications; Home appliances; incremental data-mining; Medical services; Monitoring; prediction; smart cities; smart homes; Smart homes; Smart meters; Urban areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we consider the paradigm where cloud service providers collect big data from resource-constrained devices for building ML-based prediction models that are then sent back to be run locally on the intermittently connected resource-constrained devices. Our proposed solution comprises an intelligent polynomial-time heuristic that maximizes the level of trust of ML models by selecting and switching between a subset of the ML models from a superset of models in order to maximize the trustworthiness while respecting the given reconfiguration budget/rate and reducing the cloud communication overhead. We evaluate the performance of our proposed heuristic using two case studies. First, we consider Industrial IoT (IIoT) services, and as a proxy for this setting, we use the turbofan engine degradation simulation data set to predict the remaining useful life of an engine. Our results in this setting show that the trust level of the selected models is 0.49%-3.17% less compared to the results obtained using integer linear programming (ILP). Second, we consider smart cities services, and as a proxy of this setting, we use an experimental transportation data set to predict the number of cars. Our results show that the selected model's trust level is 0.7%-2.53% less compared to the results obtained using ILP. We also show that our proposed heuristic achieves an optimal competitive ratio in a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem.",2021-02-15,2025-10-16 11:42:02,2025-10-16 11:42:02,,2943-2958,,4,8,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adversarial attacks; automatic model selection; Cloud computing; Data models; deep learning (DL); Industrial IoT (IIoT); Internet of Things; Machine learning; ML as a Service (MLaaS); Predictive maintenance; Predictive models; Smart cities; smart city; trusted machine learning (ML) models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the traditional SIR model, the model newly added free carriers. These people are the source of the spread of the epidemic. You can control the spread of the epidemic by controlling the free carriers. The simulation proves the rationality of the model. This model can achieve a better fitting effect on the development trend of the number of outbreaks in each province, which shows the importance of the closure and isolation measures for the prevention and control of the outbreak, and also verifies the secondary propagation model found in the visualization stage.

At the same time, the deep learning algorithm is used to classify and warn the danger level of the trajectory of the people who are about to go in or go out of the residential district, schools, etc. It provides strong support for the public security, health and epidemic command and other government departments to achieve scientific prevention and control, intelligent prevention and control. The results show that spark can achieve high throughput and fault-tolerant real-time stream data processing. Geospark processes large-scale spatial data on the basis of spark, and can create point, line, surface and other spatial data structures based on longitude and latitude information. At the same time, the semi supervised learning model based on recurrent neural network is used to classify and early warn the danger level of personnel trajectories. The experiment randomly selected 2000 users from districts and schools in Chengdu, and divided the experimental data set into training set and verification set in the proportion of 8:2. The best performance of the trained model is 96.2%.",2021-06-25,2025-10-16 11:42:16,2025-10-16 11:42:16,,13-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2021 International Conference on Big Data Analysis and Computer Science (BDACS),,,,Big Data; COVID-19; Deep learning; Epidemics; GeoSpark; Government; Real-time systems; Spark; Spatial databases; Spatiotemporal phenomena; Trajectory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 International Conference on Big Data Analysis and Computer Science (BDACS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only through extracting value from huge data through data analytics can big data's full potential be accomplished [6]. Machine learning (ML) plays a highly essential part in this process because of its capacity to know patterns and then deliver insights through learning from facts. Since the data may include private information about individuals, governments, or financial accounts, using a more traditional technique raises serious concerns about data confidentiality. Recently, Federated learning (FL) seemed like a potential learning procedure that could help us get beyond this obstacle. In FL, the central ML algorithm is only given the parameters from the local devices so that it can train and make predictions on a global scale. The aforementioned problems with huge data may be amenable to resolution thanks to this aspect of FL. Furthermore, a thorough assessment of FL for big data applications has forward done, leaving a void in the literature. This article delivers a summary of FL, big data, and the motives for the procedure of FL for big data by surveying its use in big data applications. In particular, it is important to thoroughly examine the usage of FL for major big data services with applications like the smart city, remote surgery, transportation, smart grid, and social networks.

As a result, smart cities emerged mainly as a result of highly innovative ICT industries and markets, and additionally, they have started to use novel solutions taking advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and cloud computing technologies to establish a profound connection between each component and layer of a city. Several key technologies congregate to build a working smart city considering human requirements. Even though the smart city concept is an advanced solution for today's cities, recently, more living spaces should be discovered, and the concept of a smart city could be moved to these alternative living spaces, namely floating cities. The concept of a floating city emerged as a novel solution due to rising sea levels and land scarcity in order to provide alternative living spaces for humanity. In this article, our main research question is to raise awareness on the current state of smart city concepts across the world by understanding the key future trends, including floating cities, by motivating researchers and scientists through new IoT technologies and applications. Therefore, we present a survey of smart city initiatives and analyze their key concepts and different data management techniques. We performed a detailed literature survey and review by applying a complex literature matrix including terms, like smart people, smart economy, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living.

This situation is more prevalent in smart cities where such devices are used for autonomous control and monitoring. Smart cities have different kinds of applications that are aided through IoT devices that collect data, send it to computational processing and storage devices, and get back decisions or actuate the actions based on the input data. There has been a stringent requirement to reduce the end-to-end delay in this process owing to the remote deployment of cloud data centres. This eventually led to the revolution of edge computing, wherein nano–micro-processing devices can be deployed closer to the premises of the smart application and process the data generated with a lower turnaround time. However, due to the limited computational power and storage, controlling the workload diverted to the edge devices has been challenging. The workload scheduling policies and task allocation schemes often fail to consider the run time health of the edge devices due to a lack of proper monitoring infrastructure. Thus, in this article, we proposed a health monitoring and diagnosis framework for geo-distributed edge clusters processing big data generated by smart city applications. This framework is built over the Map-Reduce approach for distributed processing of big data on edge clusters deployed across the smart city. Within this framework, SmartMonit (a monitoring agent) is deployed that collects the health statistics of edge devices and predicts the potential failures using an artificial neural network-based self-organising maps approach.

La Rocca,The smart city and mobility: The functional polarization of urban flow,2017 5th IEEE International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS),,,10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005730,,"The paper deals with the definition of urban mobility, assuming that inside the city, the flow of mobility is deeply connected with the distribution, quality and use of the urban activities that “polarize” different users (residents, commuters, tourists and city users). In this vision, ICT assume a strategic role, but the need to reconsider their role emerges in respect to the concept of a smart city. The consideration that “urban smartness” does not depend exclusively on the ICT component or on the quantitative presence of technologies in the city, in fact, represents a shared opinion within the current scientific debate on the subject of the smart city. The paper assumes that, for the present urban contexts, the smart vision has to be related to an integrated approach, which considers the city as a complex system. Inside the urban system, the networks for both material and immaterial mobility interact with the urban activities that play a supporting role and have characteristics that affect the levels of urban smartness. Changes in urban systems greatly depend on the sorts of innovation technology that have intensely modified the social component to a far greater extent than others. Big Data, for instance, can help with knowledge of urban processes, provided they have to be well-interpreted and managed, and this will be of interest within the interactions among urban systems and the functioning of the system as a whole. Town planning has to take on responsibility in regard to approaching cities according to a different vision and updating its tools in order to steer the urban system steadfastly into a smartness state. In a systemic vision, this transition must be framed within the context of a process of governmental transformation that is carefully oriented towards the individuation of interactions among the different subsystems composing the city. According to this vision, the study of urban mobility can be related to the attractiveness generated by the different urban functions. The formalization of the degree of polarization, activated by urban functions, represents the main objective of this study. Among the urban functions, the study considers tourism as one of the most significant in the formalization of urban mobility flow inside the smart city.",2017-06-26,2025-10-16 11:42:16,2025-10-16 11:42:16,,532-537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2017 5th IEEE International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS),,,,Big Data; Education; functional polarization; Manufacturing; Planning; Public transportation; Smart cities; smart city; systemic approach; tourism activity; urban mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 5th IEEE International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To cope with data variety and to support querying facilities and navigation, domain experts, who possess the knowledge required to understand data sources structure and content, resort to the definition of metadata layers, for reconciling terminological differences and resolving ambiguity of data sources attributes. To this aim, the adoption of Semantic Web technologies assures a unified view of heterogeneous data sources and improves data access, leveraging open standards for knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose an approach to create a semantic data layer over Smart City data sources. The approach is grounded on two main pillars: (i) a procedure, to build and manage the semantic layer; (ii) a tool, implementing the steps of the procedure, devoted to support domain experts. Results of an experimentation conducted on representative Smart City data sources demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach. In particular, the presence in our approach of a preliminary step regarding lexical enrichment of data source attributes helped increasing the retrieval of useful concepts from domain ontologies for attribute annotation. In addition, allowing domain experts to provide additional ontological knowledge by specialising or creating new concepts and semantic relationships fostered flexibility in the annotation procedure, facilitating the evolution of the semantic layer. Finally, the developed semi-automatic tool helped domain experts in the semantic annotation process by also providing validation support.",2021-09-07,2025-10-16 11:42:16,2025-10-16 11:42:16,,1-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2),,,,Annotations; Conferences; Ecosystems; heterogeneous data sources; Navigation; semantic layer; Semantic Web; Semantics; Smart cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, single-threaded optimization algorithms can no longer meet the needs of big data applications. When a single machine is trained, it will face the problem of insufficient memory and limited computing capacity. Therefore, distributed algorithms have been proposed to solve big data classification, and have received much attention. Particularly, distributed gradient descent (GD) is a widely-used algorithm for solving big data problem. However, distributed algorithms based on GD always converge slowly and suffer from expensive time in the training process. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel fast distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm for big data classification in this paper. By formulating the original optimization problem as a series of subproblems for classification in each machine. In particular, we exploit a fast stochastic method combined with the Nesterov acceleration method for sub-problem optimization in parallel to improve the convergence speed, and thus reduce the training time. The experimental results on some public and benchmark data sets show that our proposed distributed algorithm can converge faster with the competitive accuracy performance compared with distributed GD-based methods, which is suitable to big data classification.",2021-12-20,2025-10-16 11:42:16,2025-10-16 11:42:16,,1707-1713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE 23rd Int Conf on High Performance Computing & Communications; 7th Int Conf on Data Science & Systems; 19th Int Conf on Smart City; 7th Int Conf on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud & Big Data Systems & Application (HPCC/DSS/SmartCity/DependSys)",,,,Benchmark testing; Big Data; Classification algorithms; Distributed algorithms; Gradient Descent; Machine learning algorithms; Nesterov Acceleration; Smart cities; Stochastic Gradient Descent; Training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2021 IEEE 23rd Int Conf on High Performance Computing & Communications; 7th Int Conf on Data Science & Systems; 19th Int Conf on Smart City; 7th Int Conf on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud & Big Data Systems & Application (HPCC/DSS/SmartCity/DependSys)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The traditional methods for urban planning mainly rely on the district's GDP, employment rate, population density, information from questionnaire surveys, and so on. However, as a comparison, such information is becoming relatively less informative as the explosion of an increasing amount of urban data. What is more, there is a serious shortcoming in these methods, i.e., they are independent representations of the attraction of a district and do not take into account the interaction among districts. With the development of urban computing, it is possible to make good use of urban data for urban planning. To this end, based on taxi big data obtained from Guangzhou, China, this article proposes a district attraction ranking approach called AttractRank, which for the first time uses taxi big data for district ranking. An application system is developed for demonstration purposes. First, the entire Guangzhou city is divided into a number of districts by using constrained K-means. Second, the original PageRank algorithm is extended to integrate with the taxi's origin–destination ($OD$) points to establish the $OD$ matrix, whereby the attraction ranking of each district can be calculated. Finally, by visualizing the results and case studies obtained from AttractRank, we can successfully obtain the pattern of how attractions of districts change over time and interesting discoveries on urban lives; therefore, it has wide applications in urban planning and urban data mining.",2021-03,2025-10-16 11:42:16,2025-10-16 11:42:16,,1679-1688,,3,17,,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big Data; Constrained K-means; Data mining; Data visualization; district attraction; Informatics; PageRank; Public transportation; Taxi's origin–destination points; Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ontologies play a fundamental role in this regard; however, graph databases exploiting ontologies to set up knowledge bases are inefficient in handling big data time series and multiple formats. NoSQL solutions excel in storing big data. In this paper, a novel semantic driven process is proposed capable to store, enrich, and forward data messages providing support for semantic data retrieval taking into account relational, temporal, and geographic/spatial queries and real time event driven data. The solution is at the core of the open source Snap4City Digital Twin platform which is currently in use in the context of the Italian National Center for Sustainable Mobility, and for the national center on HPC in Italy.",2025-07-21,2025-10-16 11:42:16,2025-10-16 11:42:16,,44-51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2025 IEEE 11th International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Machine Learning Applications (BigDataService),,,,Big Data; Computer architecture; Data ingestion; Digital Twin; Digital twins; Knowledge Base; Knowledge based systems; NoSQL; Ontologies; Ontology; Real-time systems; Semantics; Smart cities; Smart City; Visual analytics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025 IEEE 11th International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Machine Learning Applications (BigDataService),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Big data platforms span numerous fields, including education, government services, and e-commerce. Ensuring data compliance across these sectors has drawn considerable attention from both governmental and enterprise managers. To address this, relevant enterprises and scholars have developed numerous standards tailored specifically to various industry sectors. Thus, differentiating their similarities and differences demands extensive experience in platform development and in-depth knowledge of these standards. This implicitly elevates the difficulty and entry barrier for compliance detection in big data platform usage. The current standard compliance checks mainly rely on manual inspections, typically taking anywhere from one week to three months to complete. Recently, Zhan et al. proposed two automated methods enabling risk quantification for big data platforms based on standard documents. However, these approaches still have not resolved the automation of transforming standards into usable templates for these systems. In practice, developing such templates from standards requires experienced developers and typically takes from three days to one week, significantly restricting platform scalability. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their powerful text parsing capabilities have drawn extensive attention from researchers. Based on this, we propose a method named LLMQua, which utilizes LLMs to automatically generate risk quantification templates, reducing the standard-to-template conversion time to the scale of minutes. Experimental results show that the method achieves high accuracy and stability, and can be effectively integrated with the approach proposed by Zhan et al., significantly enhancing the scalability of the system.",2025-08-01,2025-10-16 11:42:16,2025-10-16 11:42:16,,345-353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2025 11th IEEE International Conference on Privacy Computing and Data Security (PCDS),,,,Automation; Big Data; big data platform; Government; large language models; Large language models; Manuals; Ontologies; quantitative risk assessment; Scalability; Semantics; Stability criteria; Standards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025 11th IEEE International Conference on Privacy Computing and Data Security (PCDS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smart city infrastructure will need to process data from various scientific and engineering domains like weather variability, traffic management, disease control etc in real-time while keeping the operational costs to minimum. In this paper we build a case for using General Purpose GPUs (GPGPU) as an alternate to the traditional CPU based computing. Utilising the GPUs in development of smart city infrastructure is an attractive alternate as it provides an efficient computing capacity when compared with traditional CPU only solutions. However, we find that naive deployment of applications on high-density GPUs results in lower scalability and performance.

The resulting big data creates opportunities to develop diverse sets of context-aware services and systems, ensuring smart city services are optimized to the dynamic city environment. Critical resources in these smart cities will be more rapidly deployed to regions in need, and those regions predicted to have an imminent or prospective need. For example, crime data analytics may be used to optimize the distribution of police, medical, and emergency services. However, as smart city services become dependent on data, they also become susceptible to disruptions in data streams, such as data loss due to signal quality reduction or due to power loss during data collection. This paper presents a dynamic network model for improving service resilience to data loss. The network model identifies statistically significant shared temporal trends across multivariate spatiotemporal data streams and utilizes these trends to improve data prediction performance in the case of data loss. Dynamics also allow the system to respond to changes in the data streams such as the loss or addition of new information flows. The network model is demonstrated by city-based crime rates reported in Montgomery County, MD, USA. A resilient network is developed utilizing shared temporal trends between cities to provide improved crime rate prediction and robustness to data loss, compared with the use of single city-based auto-regression. A maximum improvement in performance of 7.8 % for Silver Spring is found and an average improvement of 5.6 % among cities with high crime rates. The model also correctly identifies all the optimal network connections, according to prediction error minimization. City-to-city distance is designated as a predictor of shared temporal trends in crime and weather is shown to be a strong predictor of crime in Montgomery County.",2017,2025-10-16 11:42:17,2025-10-16 11:42:17,,20524-20535,,,5,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adaptive algorithms; Data models; geospatial analysis; Market research; predictive models; Predictive models; Resilience; Sensors; Smart cities; statistical learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been a crucial issue of network operation that once multiple links fail simultaneously, the transmission of real-time services cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, rapid locating of faults is the premise for network to recover quickly. However, current faults location methods can't satisfy the requirement due to the expansion scale of wireless and optical networks and the growing demands of customers. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-link faults location algorithm based on Hopfield Neural Network (HNN). We make full use of the information of network topology and the services transmitted to model the relationship between fault set and alarm set. HNN is used as an optimization method to analyze the uncertainty of faults and alarms and to find where the faults most likely occur by constructing a proper energy function. It has been proved by experiments that this method can achieve real-time faults location while ensuring positioning accuracy, which provides a good solution for smart city service assurance.",2019-06-24,2025-10-16 11:42:17,2025-10-16 11:42:17,,1696-1701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2019 15th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC),,,,Bipartite graph; Fault location; Hopfield Neural Network; Monitoring; multi-link faults location; Neurons; Optical fiber networks; service quality assurance; Smart cities; smart city IoT; wireless and optical network; Wireless communication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 15th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they frequently struggle to maintain competitiveness, especially amid rapid market shifts and challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation underscores the necessity for digital transformation, with technologies such as Big Data becoming key to enhancing SMEs' efficiency and market visibility. This study investigates how Big Data can bolster SME competitiveness using two approaches: bibliometric analysis and narrative literature review. The bibliometric analysis shows a growing emphasis on Big Data's role in enabling SMEs to overcome resource constraints, forecast market trends, and adjust to evolving consumer preferences. The main research areas identified include sustainability, innovation, and digital transformation. The narrative literature review explores the specific hurdles SMEs face when adopting Big Data, including limited financial resources, insufficient technological infrastructure, and a lack of expertise in handling large datasets. It also recommends strategies to address these issues, such as partnering with technology providers, seeking government assistance, investing in employee training, and adopting cloud-based solutions. In conclusion, while SMEs encounter significant challenges in adopting Big Data, there are practical strategies available to unlock its potential. By addressing these obstacles, SMEs can enhance their efficiency, innovation, and competitiveness on a global scale.

Such large volume of data generated is referred to as big data, which now are revolutionizing all aspects of our life ranging from enterprises to individuals, from science communities to governments, as they exhibit great potentials to improve efficiency of enterprises and the quality of life. To obtain nontrivial patterns and derive valuable information from big data, a fundamental problem is how to properly place the collected data by different users to distributed clouds and to efficiently analyze the collected data to save user costs in data storage and processing, particularly the cost savings of users who share data. By doing so, it needs the close collaborations among the users, by sharing and utilizing the big data in distributed clouds due to the complexity and volume of big data. Since computing, storage and bandwidth resources in a distributed cloud usually are limited, and such resource provisioning typically is expensive, the collaborative users require to make use of the resources fairly. In this paper, we study a novel collaboration- and fairness-aware big data management problem in distributed cloud environments that aims to maximize the system throughout, while minimizing the operational cost of service providers to achieve the system throughput, subject to resource capacity and user fairness constraints. We first propose a novel optimization framework for the problem. We then devise a fast yet scalable approximation algorithm based on the built optimization framework. We also analyze the time complexity and approximation ratio of the proposed algorithm. We finally conduct experiments by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Innovative city operations require real-time processing of vast volumes of data from various sources like sensors, IOT devices, or social media so that it can be analyzed and acted on in real-time with better automation for its infrastructure against different parameters. This article examines the potential of cloud computing to enable real-time big data analytics for smart cities and infrastructure automation. The cloud allows for real-time big data analytics, collecting input from disparate sources across a business ecosystem and analyzing it immediately for actionable insights. The need for large amounts of data combined with the nature of many Iota devices necessitates processing and storage at scale, a task uniquely suited to cloud computing due to its ability to provide scalability, flexibility, and lower cost essential qualities in building intelligent cities or automated infrastructure. Cloud computing offers a space for shared data and collaborative analysis, allowing the city government to open up its vast browser-based datasets so that other agencies (both within government and outside it), researchers, and even citizens can access this information, in turn driving innovation or assisting with strategic planning. Moreover, the evolution not just in cloud-based machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms but also device-side AI/ML allows for predictive analytics, which can be helpful to preemptively discern potential failures to prevent them pro-actively, thus augmenting city operations efficacy as well as resource utilization besides operational efficiency of infrastructural management.

This work explores the digital twin of EIoT (EIoT-DT) and then provides a novel data-driven SA paradigm, named DT-SA, as a promising alternative. Based on the combination of the latest data technologies and machine learning algorithms, DT-SA transfers those stubborn SA challenges to digital space, and then addresses them by building a domain-specific and data-friendly digital twin (DT) model upon massive data. The established model can be quantitatively tested via iterative virtual–real interaction and, thus, be evaluated and updated through closed-loop feedback to improve its performance in the physical world. To this end, some engineering and scientific problems are raised: 1) virtual–real interaction mechanism relevant to resource flow and data flow; 2) unified modeling and analysis of heterogeneous spatial–temporal data; 3) DT configuration and evolution; and 4) domain-specific DT-SA characterization. To solve these problems, cloud-edge-terminal configuration, big data analytics (BDA), DT, and SA indicator systems are studied, respectively. Then, the random matrix theory (RMT) and overarching DT-SA framework are designed as a roadmap.

However, the Big Data community has focused mainly on technologies to obtain information, and not on the goal of the business. The objective of this paper is to offer an overview of how some Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) proposals are used to obtain the requirements of the Big Data system, serving as a starting point for future research. The methodology used is the Systematic Mapping.

Lee,SLARS: Secure Lightweight Authentication for Roaming Service in Smart City,IEICE Transactions on Communications,,1745-1345,10.23919/transcom.2024EBP3004,,"Smart cities aim to improve the quality of life of citizens and efficiency of city operations through utilization of 5G communication technology. Based on various technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and big data, they provide smart services in terms of urban planning, development, and management for solving problems such as fine dust, traffic congestion and safety, energy efficiency, water shortage, and an aging population. However, as smart city has an open network structure, an adversary can easily try to gain illegal access and perform denial of service and sniffing attacks that can threaten the safety and privacy of citizens. In smart cities, the global mobility network (GLOMONET) supports mobile services between heterogeneous networks of mobile devices such as autonomous vehicles and drones. Recently, Chen et al. proposed a user authentication scheme for GLOMONET in smart cities. Nevertheless, we found some weaknesses in the scheme proposed by them. In this study, we propose a secure lightweight authentication for roaming services in a smart city, called SLARS, to enhance security. We proved that SLARS is more secure and efficient than the related authentication scheme for GLOMONET through security and performance analysis. Our analysis results show that SLARS satisfies all security requirements in GLOMONET and saves 72.7% of computation time compared to that of Chen et al.'s scheme.",2024-09,2025-10-16 11:42:17,2025-10-16 11:42:17,,595-606,,9,E107-B,,IEICE Transactions on Communications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Authentication; authentication protocols; Biological system modeling; Elliptic curves; heterogeneous networks; mobile communication; multi-factor authentication; roaming; Roaming; Safety; Smart cards; Smart cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, given the development of big data, the availability of free software, and the large amount of real- time data generated and stored, the chemical industry is still not fully adopting big data. Moreover, the industry is just starting to realise the importance of the large amount of data it owns to assist in making the right decisions and support its strategies. Therefore, this article explores the significance and influence of identified gap variables, namely professional competencies, business intelligence, data scalability, process monitoring, and investment in tools, for the adoption of big data in the chemical industry. This study follows a survey-based quantitative method using structural equation modelling. The data collected was studied to draw scientific conclusions about the myriad of hypothesised relationships. This was accomplished by employing a positivist paradigm in the research process. This study recognises the strong relationship between data scalability, process monitoring, and the investment in tools for big data adoption as a contribution towards industry application and practice. Mediation effects between the constructs and final measures were studied as part of this research, and the significance of their relationships was established. This study contributes to the application of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Based on the literature survey and research outcomes, this study also positions the chemical industry in Davenport and Harris's paradigm of analytical maturity. This article's conclusions and contributions towards practical application are expected to support a shift from conventional methods towards a data-driven approach to decision-making in the chemical industry. To further achieve the objectives, conclusions, and future research directions presented in this article, suggest government, academia, and industry must work together to overcome all present and potential challenges.",2022-11-01,2025-10-16 11:42:17,2025-10-16 11:42:17,,1-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: TENCON 2022 - 2022 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON),,,,Big Data; Business Intelligence; Chemical industry; Chemical Industry; Companies; Data Scalability; Decision making; Investment in Tools; Mathematical models; Process monitoring; Process Monitoring; Professional Competencies; Scalability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TENCON 2022 - 2022 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eco-city would result in livable and environmentally sustainable communities without resources being wasted or damaging biodiversity. Significant changes in the environmentally acceptable are occurring because of the paradigm change in technology and science brought about by big data research. The planning and design of sustainable cities, as well as their operational management and the use of distributed design approaches and technological solutions, need meticulous attention to detail and the treatment of the whole system. This emerging industry addresses a significant need for bridging the gap between sustainable urbanism and smart city principles. The field of study known as “data-driven smart ecological sustainability” has expanded greatly during the last several years. This paper proposes a big data science and analytics-based persuasive evidence-synthesis framework (BDSA-PESF) for evaluating and planning eco-city development in urban areas. For cities to achieve their sustainability objectives in the face of rapid growth and shifting planning and management systems, data-driven solutions are essential. Pros and downsides of smart urbanism in the context of enacting environmentally friendly urban changes have been examined in this research, prompting more discussions on the topic in the big data era. Researchers learn that there are similarities and distinctions across the many sustainability-related definitions. The numerical outcomes demonstrate that the recommended technique has a high-performance rate of 93.86, prediction rate of 92.11%, tracking rate of 95.23 %, sustainable management ratio of 93.32 %, efficiency ratio of 93.51 %, probability ratio of 96.3 %, accuracy analysis of 89.9 % and energy consumption ratio of 96.8 % than other existing approaches.",2024-11-20,2025-10-16 11:42:17,2025-10-16 11:42:17,,1-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2024 IEEE 9th International Conference on Engineering Technologies and Applied Sciences (ICETAS),,,,Accuracy; Big Data; big data science; Eco-city development; Energy consumption; Face recognition; Industries; persuasive evidence synthesis; Planning; Pressing; Smart cities; Sustainable development; sustainable policymaking; urban planning; Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024 IEEE 9th International Conference on Engineering Technologies and Applied Sciences (ICETAS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Privacy concerns become evident because there are a large number of private data by various applications in the smart city, such as sensitive data of governments or proprietary information of enterprises. To protect the private data, the proposed model uses the BGV encryption scheme to encrypt the private data and employs cloud servers to perform the high-order back-propagation algorithm on the encrypted data efficiently for deep computation model training. Furthermore, the proposed scheme approximates the Sigmoid function as a polynomial function to support the secure computation of the activation function with the BGV encryption. In our scheme, only the encryption operations and the decryption operations are performed by the client while all the computation tasks are performed on the cloud. Experimental results show that our scheme is improved by approximately 2.5 times in the training efficiency compared to the conventional deep computation model without disclosing the private data using the cloud computing including ten nodes. More importantly, our scheme is highly scalable by employing more cloud servers, which is particularly suitable for big data.",2016-05-01,2025-10-16 11:42:17,2025-10-16 11:42:17,,1351-1362,,5,65,,IEEE Transactions on Computers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BGN encryption; BGV encryption; big data; Big data; cloud computing; Cloud computing; Computational modeling; Data models; Data privacy; deep computation model; Deep computation model; Encryption; high-order back-propagation; High-order back-propagation; Smart city; Training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research shows that big data tax administration can reduce the degree of corporate profit manipulation, improve corporate independence, avoid improper related party transactions, improve the information transparency and regulatory efficiency of data sources, reduce corporate institutional transaction costs, and improve tax compliance. It is further found that big data tax administration can play a greater role in enterprises with higher tax avoidance motivation and bad credit rating.

Big data analytics technology is mainly applied in business intelligence, government decision-making, public services and so on. In response to the shortcomings of principal component analysis method in processing data with time series, a new model, namely grey principal component analysis (GPCA), is proposed by combining grey system thinking with classical principal component analysis based on the characteristics of data with time series in grey systems. Time series analysis can not only quantitatively reveal the development and changes of a certain phenomenon, but also dynamically depict the internal quantitative relationships and changes between a certain phenomenon and other phenomena. Through the generation and development of series, the grey system theory devotes itself to the discussion of practical laws, while mathematical statistics devotes itself to the study of statistical historical laws. Combining the advantages of the two methods to solve time series problems, the system was implemented using object-oriented programming methods. The application of this method to the comprehensive evaluation of living environment indicators in Dalian highlights the impact of new time series data on the entire data, and the analysis results can provide valuable decision-making basis for decision-makers. The experimental results indicate that the use of grey principal component analysis is more effective and can accurately reflect the impact of time on the sample data.",2023-04-07,2025-10-16 11:42:34,2025-10-16 11:42:34,,200-204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2023 4th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Application (ICCEA),,,,Big data; Big Data; Decision making; GPCA; Object oriented modeling; object-oriented; Operating systems; PCA; Systems thinking; Time series analysis; Visualization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023 4th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Application (ICCEA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper investigated the characteristics of publically available data sets in health informatics that were derived from electronic health records (EHRs), healthcare systems, and a variety of open-government libraries, data marts, or data catalogues.Data used in this study consisted of public data sets that did not require any registration to access online. In total, nine web-based platforms on the Internet were used that included: British Columbia (BC) Data Catalogue, Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), Harvard Dataverse, MIMIC-eICU, FigShare, GitHub, Google Dataset, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and Zenodo. Our initial search across these platforms found over 10,000 public use files that had data sets related to health informatics.We found 558 data sets that matched search criterion that ranged from years 2013-2022. The data source types were mostly found using the health informatics search filters followed by the combination of health informatics and healthcare systems, but fewer data sets were found when using EHR as the criterion. Almost 85% of the total data sets were from 2020-2022. The range of data sizes were 11KB to 7.8MB. The eICU (hosted by MIT’s MIMIC data mart) platform had the largest data set followed by Zenodo, and GitHub. Additionally, any bioinformatics in the 558 data sets were excluded and further classification on the content and usability, and dashboard visualization towards experiential learning resulted in 117 data sets.Of these 117 data sets, we further tested their usability to graph and create a dashboard within 2-5 minutes of loading the data to Tableau© that then used a Data Usability Scale (DUS) scoring developed from the industry standard of System Usability Scale (SUS). Data were deemed usable and useful for >60% average DUS scoring. Finally, 25 sets of data could be used effectively in classroom exercises dealing with electronic records and decision support for health care. Best data for dashboard usability were from MIMIC-eICU, and other websites like Zenodo produced low to high usability. The data sets with low to poor usability were from FigShare, Dataverse, CIHI, and BC Data Catalogue, respectively.Overall, 25 data sets with high usability of data related health informatics and healthcare systems showed 60-85% usability. Moreover, all nine platforms showed ease-of-use search patterns to establish the criteria in a short amount of time.

It is impractical to aggregate all video streams from hundreds of thousands of cameras for big data analysis. Transcoding the videos to low-bitrate ones is the conventional solution to solve the aggregation bottleneck. However, it is recognized that transcoding will inevitably affect visual feature extraction, consequently degrading the subsequent analysis performance. To address these challenges, we thus propose a new video big data analysis framework, called end-edge-cloud collaborative system. Under the end-edge-cloud collaborative framework, a camera can output two streams simultaneously, including a compressed video stream for viewing and data storage, and a compact feature stream extracted from the original video signals for visual analysis. Video stream and feature stream are synchronized by unified identification. We identify three key technologies to enable the end-edge-cloud collaborative system, including analysis-friendly video coding, visual feature compact descriptor, and user-defined neural network and parameter updating. By real-time feeding only the feature streams into the cloud center, these cameras thus form a large-scale brain-like vision system for the smart city. A prototype has been implemented to demonstrate its feasibility. Experiment results show that our system can achieve high efficient video compression and guarantee the analysis performance. Furthermore, our system makes the big data analysis feasible which only need aggregate low bit-rate compressed feature stream.",2020-08-06,2025-10-16 11:42:48,2025-10-16 11:42:48,,233-236,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (MIPR),,,,Analysis-friendly Video Coding; Big Data; Cameras; City Brain; Collaboration; Collaborative; Compact Feature Representation; Data Aggregation; Feature extraction; Servers; Streaming media; Visualization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020 IEEE Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (MIPR),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, in the field of knowledge engineering, knowledge graphs, especially domain knowledge graphs, play important roles and become the infrastructure of Internet knowledge-driven intelligent applications. Domain concept extraction is critical to the construction of domain knowledge graphs. Although there have been some works that have extracted concepts, semantic information has not been fully used. However, the excellent concept extraction results can be obtained by making full use of semantic information. In this article, a novel concept extraction method, Semantic Graph-Based Concept Extraction (SGCCE), is proposed. First, the similarities between terms are calculated using the word co-occurrence, the LDA topic model and Word2Vec. Then, a semantic graph of terms is constructed based on the similarities between the terms. Finally, according to the semantic graph of the terms, community detection algorithms are used to divide the terms into different communities where each community acts as a concept. In the experiments, we compare the concept extraction results that are obtained by different community detection algorithms to analyze the different semantic graphs. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method. This method can effectively use semantic information, and the results of the concept extraction are better from domain big data in smart cities.",2020-02,2025-10-16 11:42:48,2025-10-16 11:42:48,,225-233,,1,7,,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big Data; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Detection algorithms; Frequency-domain analysis; Knowledge discovery; Semantics; Smart cities; text analysis; text mining,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AVs are envisaged to evolve to a service rather than a product in the future. To provide best user experience of such services, three primary factors, namely, waiting time, travel time, and supply of AV services, are taken into consideration in a multiobjective optimization. Conventional optimization of services relies on traffic flow analysis over a queuing network model. However, due to the mobility of vehicles and the transfer uncertainty of road networks, the queuing network analysis is too complicated and practically intractable. For accuracy and convenient processing, network calculus (NC) is extended to model the queueing problem in this paper. The optimal number of available AVs can be identified by guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. The satisfaction of AV services can be viewed as a supply and demand problem, and optimized by bipartite graph matching. In order to reduce the average travel time, especially for rush hours with heavy traffic, we further propose a new online AVs fleet management scheme with congestion control for smart cities. It is shown that the intelligent management of AV fleet can be efficiently achieved, outperforming the cases of traditional vehicles.

Li,Hybrid AI and Big Data Solutions for Dynamic Urban Planning and Smart City Optimization,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3516544,,"Urban planning faces complex challenges, including efficient resource allocation, traffic management, and infrastructure optimization. Traditional methods often fall short in addressing these multifaceted issues, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. This study introduces a novel approach by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Simulated Annealing (SA) to tackle these challenges in urban planning. GNNs are employed to extract meaningful features and relationships from urban infrastructure and social networks, providing a detailed understanding of patterns and interactions. SA is then used to optimize resource allocation, traffic routing, and scheduling tasks based on the insights derived from GNNs. This hybrid methodology allows for an iterative refinement process, where updated features from GNNs continuously enhance the optimization performed by SA. Key findings of the study reveal significant improvements. Traffic congestion was reduced by 25%, and average travel times decreased by 18%. Resource allocation efficiency improved by 30%, with a 20% reduction in resource wastage. Infrastructure optimization metrics showed a 22% gain in cost efficiency and a 15% increase in accessibility. The combined GNN-SA approach proved effective in addressing urban planning inefficiencies and optimizing various aspects of smart city management.

With the development of e-government, the government information system has accumulated a huge amount of unstructured information, including text, table and other forms, rich in profound administrative semantics, but its effective management and fine analysis is still a challenge to be solved. Therefore, this study adopts the graph neural network technology under the framework of deep learning, constructs the relationship network diagram among government entities, and synthesizes node characteristics and network topology structure information, and focuses on the deep understanding and classification problems of unstructured government data. At the same time, in view of the complex correlation of government data, we optimize the traditional graph neural network model, which improves the applicability and expressiveness of the model in complex relationship modeling and classification tasks in the field of government affairs. Experimental results show that the improved graph neural network model can accurately capture and analyze the complex relationships among government data, and significantly improve the performance of unstructured government data classification tasks. The technical achievements obtained from this research have a significant impact on the administrative departments in practical applications, and can show significant advantages in the field of intelligent processing of government data. Through advanced algorithm technology and deep learning model, it can help the administrative departments realize the fine calculation and optimization of resource allocation strategies, and improve the automation and intelligence of internal management system processes. Effectively respond to complex computing challenges arising from the diverse service needs of the public, and respond efficiently to various uncertainties and complexities in the social governance environment. More importantly, this achievement, especially in the research field of applying neural network technology to the in-depth analysis of government data, shows the great value of cutting-edge technology to drive the process of government intelligence.",2024-04-19,2025-10-16 11:42:49,2025-10-16 11:42:49,,220-227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2024 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Power Systems (AIPS),,,,Accuracy; classification algorithm; Classification algorithms; Correlation; Data models; deep learning; Deep learning; Government; graph neural network; Graph neural networks; Power system stability; Random forests; topology; Uncertainty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Power Systems (AIPS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supangkat,Big Data Analytics for Safe and Secure City,2018 International Conference on ICT for Smart Society (ICISS),,,10.1109/ICTSS.2018.8550023,,"The world's population continues to grow. Today, there are more than 7 billion people on earth. That number increased 180 percent from 1950 where the earth's population reached only 2.5 billion people. The growing number of populations poses great challenges for the government. In general, urban populations tend to be better than rural populations, with greater access to public services such as transportation, education and health care, as well as higher literacy rates and life expectancy. Driven by these benefits, the global population tends to increase in the level of urbanization. Today, more than half the world's population lives in urban areas, and by 2050, this number will grow to 70 percent. Much of the growth of urbanization will come from developing countries, which are expected to double their urban population from 2.5 billion in 2009 to nearly 5.2 billion by 2050. Such statistics are needed to give a sense of the scale of the challenges facing governments and city planners. It is important to look beyond statistics to answer people-centered questions about what life is like in these cities. In other words, focus should not only be about how these future cities can be made possible, but how they will support those who live in them. Each city can propose different answers to these questions, based on unique geographical, economic or social circumstances. Articulating an ideal city vision often requires a difficult choice between competing or even conflicting goals. However, a basic principle of any city's foundation of security and convenience is the basic criterion that characterizes a successful city.

This study advances the BDA field, whose existing utilitarian discourse on organizational readiness for change does not generally reflect the empirical and analytical reality of 261 Nigerian professionals. By drawing on business-to-business marketing, dynamic capabilities, and technology-organization-environment theoretical frameworks, we first contribute a conceptual model (see Fig. 1) to develop nine testable hypotheses to initially highlight which factors really impact on organizations' readiness to adopt BDA, second, to show the real impacts of management's post-BDA-adoption, which existing scholarship on BDA discourse had missed. Consequently, our study's findings were used to develop Fig. 2, showing the direct and moderating nature of interactions between BDA and TOE variables, from which hypotheses one and two demonstrate support for the technological and value creation of BDA adoption. However, whereas hypotheses three and four confirm top management's support and overall organizational readiness for BDA adoption in line with existing literature, paradoxically, this study's hypotheses five and seven contribute to the existing BDA discourse by highlighting that environmental, competitive pressure (CP), including regulation does not support the adoption of BDA. Additionally, while external support (H6) was found conducive for BDA adoption in line with current literature. Interestingly, hypotheses eight, nine, and 10a were also found supportive of not only FP but also NFP. However, contrary to current theorization, hypothesis 10b was not found supportive of NFP. Therefore, contrary to previous TOE scholarship, our results contribute to the BDA discourse additionally showing how CP and regulatory environment are not significantly supportive of BDA adoption; second, by highlighting how TOE's critical regulation and competition factors for BDA adoption are additionally nonimpactful on management's decision to adopt BDA. Finally, additional moderating factors particularly on external competition and government regulatory compliance are critical in ascertaining not only organizations’ FP but also their NFP readiness in the Nigerian context.

That far future is not so far, actually the advance of technology involves a more powerful hardware which is day to day is becoming into small devices with big resources [14]. The upcoming development of electronic allows that these devices could be integrated into smart networks [8]; these networks are called Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN; [13]). WSN do not need physical connections, they use communication systems such as ZigBEE, WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM [7]. Each individual device called moth have autonomous characteristics of communications, storage of data, automatic organization and recovery of the network communication among others that allow the network performs an autonomous work, with the possibility of Internet connection. These characteristic let emerge the so called Internet of Things (IoT), phrase that was coined in the early 1990's, where everyday objects have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data [1]. Since these days, technology has an exponential advance and now it is possible to find devices that permit earth observations in real time [11,15,4]. All this collected information use cloud and no-cloud storage [3]. These systems allow to store big amounts of data [6], that is collected from devices integrated in the concept of IoT [5] (especially incomes from smartphones, GPS's devices and various earth observation sensors). The analysis of this big data (some of them spatial information) will be helpful in treatment and finding related solutions in specific areas such as public administration, environment, urban services, etc. [12]. Also, the data that at the beginning was depicted like sparse information, it begins to converge into a shape. This shape can be seen like maps that could be paper maps or digital ones. The representation of the information into maps is linked to a wide range of disciplines and the concept is not new but the enhancement that it has reached until now is incredible, especially the digital information given in Internet which could be accessed by electronic devices (smart phones, tablets and computers). E-government services would improve efficiency and consequently citizen's satisfaction due to the implementation of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI, [9]). In order to good development of SDI, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OCG) has an important role. OGC is an international industry consortium of companies, government agencies and universities participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available interface standards [10]. One of the most popular OGC standards is the Web Map Service (WMS) that allows to show spatial information, considered fundamental for the development of many of the services in the way that a citizen can access to e-government services (e.g., cadastre, [2]) and e-democracy. In this talk, the objective is to introduce some concepts considered essential in the development of the modern society and smart cities.

Cyber Security for Big Data in the Cloud is getting more attention than ever. A computing breach requires digital forensics to seize digital evidence to determine who is responsible and what has been done maliciously and the possible further consequences. In particular, for Big Data attack cases, Digital Forensics is facing even more challenge for earlier digital breach investigations. For the PPI (Protection of Personal Information) a GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law has been launched to be implemented from the 25th May 2018. This compulsory regulation will have an important impact on healthcare PPI in the cloud (ICO, 2017, Deloitte, 2014). Nowadays, Big Data with the characteristics of three “V”s (Volume, Velocity, and Variety), are either synchronized with the Cloud, or stored in the Cloud, in order to solve the storage capacity and so on problems, which made Digital Forensics investigation even more difficult. The Big Data Digital Forensics issue for the Cloud is difficult. One of them is the need to identify which physical devices have been compromised. Data are distributed in the Cloud, so the customer or digital forensics practitioner cannot have full access control like the traditional investigation does. Smart City are making use of ICT (information communications technology) to collect, detect, analyze and integrate the key information data of core systems in running the cities.

Yang,Intelligent methods for managing geospatial data at the US federal government,2017 6th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics,,,10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2017.8046995,,"In many operations, the US government depends on geospatial data to obtain insights and drive policy making. Federal data are usually pulled from multiple sources, aggregated differently, and formatted in an assortment of standards. Analysts have been overwhelmed by the ample amounts of inconsistent and unstructured data available to them; the main quandary is that they are unable to draw clear conclusions from that data without proper analytics. Moreover, when dealing with geospatial data, the challenge of data management can exacerbate. Geospatial data (including longitudes, latitudes, country codes, addresses and many other forms) are applied at many governmental use-cases such as: census, military operations, natural disasters, economical research, agricultural commodities' production, US trade, and many others. To address such dire needs, this paper introduces a novel method (called G-Fed) for geospatial data management at the federal government. G-Fed provides tools for streaming, validating, aggregating, and presenting data. Furthermore, G-Fed utilizes the power of big data analytics to drive its processes. Software engineering best practices are also applied within G-Fed; such as multithreading, security roles, on-demand data tools, standardization, and accessibility. The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report to point to the matter of federal data management. GAO's report identified fourteen issues that governmental agencies need to solve to overcome their data challenges. Efficiency pressures and federal budget constraints are pushing data implementations towards more automation, extra validation, and higher security. Additionally, the Open Data and the Big Data Initiatives (signed in 2012) have put more pressure on the backs of agencies to make their data (including geospatial) open and available to the public. However, without having state-of-the-art data repositories, it is not possible to address such demands. This paper addresses these issues by presenting a step-by-step set of guidelines. G-Fed aims to help agencies organize geospatial data in a manner that makes it possible to publish, and be provided online to the keen American public. A data repository of public government data is used for experimentation of G-Fed. Experimental results are recorded and presented.",2017-08-07,2025-10-16 11:42:58,2025-10-16 11:42:58,,1-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2017 6th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics,,,,Data Management; Data visualization; Databases; Federal Geospatial Applications; Geo-Data; Geo-Mapping; Geospatial analysis; Government; Libraries; Tools; Urban areas; US Geological Survey; Visualizations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 6th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposes a novel, intelligent cable management system, of which the aim is to improve the operational and maintenance effectiveness and to support smart cities. Firstly, it discusses the challenges to the current power cable maintenance and management practice before the term of intelligent cable management is defined. Secondly, the framework of the intelligent cable management system is presented along with the supporting information platform based on Geographical Information System (GIS). Using cloud sharing technology, locations of the cable circuits, gas pipes, water pipes and other underground pipelines are displayed on the same GIS platform, based on which these underground pipelines can enjoy information sharing, collective planning, operation and maintenance. Thirdly, Internet of Things, Mobile Internet, Big Data and other new information technologies are used to improve condition monitoring and to evaluate remaining service life of power cables, in order to realize an orderly and optimal replacement of the power cables. Also the system can enable other utilities to plan systematically their underground pipeline network construction and replacement. Finally, taking the Chinese City of Suzhou's management system as an example, the paper illustrates the utilization of the novel, intelligent power cable management model to support smart city construction. The case study shows that with the aid of Cloud Sharing technology, Big Data and other IT technologies, power cable network maintenance and management practice is significantly improved and the cable network becomes more reliable.

How to optimize computation process and ensure the calculation accuracy is one of problems to be solved for massive image data fusion of the smart city. In this paper, it is proposed that image fusion and image stitching technology are combined together to build the big data computing platform of urban images. It is known that there are more data to be dealt for the image pixels-level fusion compared to feature fusion. Urban data are existed in the variation modes and shortage of content correlation. The data are sparse for city global information, but there may be redundant information for local urban region. So, the urban image fusion must meet the requirement of getting requisite and accurate information for the big data computing platform. The improved simple SIFT image registration algorithm (called S-SIFT algorithm) uses SIFT feature extraction method for getting feature point location and scale information, and some of feature point pairs are randomly selected out. The improvement of S-SIFT algorithm is reflected in reducing the time consumed by the feature description, thereby speeding up the image registration process.

The large number of devices contributed to generate a huge amount of data (Big Data) inserted in Smart City solutions, which are experiencing an explosion of complexity, also due to the increment of protocols, formats and providers. In this perspective it becomes essential to create a data indexing infrastructure that can optimize the performance of the system itself, for creating the so called data shadowing on IOT and other data on cloud. Therefore, it is fundamental to study paradigms to manage the indexing and visual analytics a great variety of data including IOT/IOE. One of the important aspects to be addressed for managing data in the smart city context are: the uniform model, the performance and scalability, response times in research, and the possibilities of performing visual analytic such as data flow analysis and drill down. All these needs imply the creation of a Smart Solution capable of managing and analysing heterogeneous kinds of data, providing a multitude of final applications based on the type of user who requires a certain service. To this end, in this paper, a unified model for IOT/IOE and data ingestion is presented. In addition, two possible architectural solutions have been implemented and compared in terms of performance, resource consumption, reliability and visual analytic tools for data flow.

Although being equipped with a myriad of connected smart devices and sensors, the smart city is still physically made up of buildings, roads, parks, industrial sites, shopping centers, etc. Therefore, location-based crisis management endorses a geospatial modeling strategy approach for major hazard data management in a smart city. Hence, spatial data remains always at the center of risk management processes. However, smart and resilient cities still strive to solve the imparity between the huge amounts of geospatial data generated mostly in real time in particular geographic user content contributions also known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and the delayed decision-making.

Government performance evaluation is a professional and specific procedure that combines quantitative and qualitative measurements to accurately evaluate the final performance results of government departments in the management process, so as to test and assess whether or to what extent the government has fulfilled its responsibilities. Government performance evaluation not only realizes the core values and public accountability goals of the government, but also is an effective mechanism for implementing government accountability. However, in reality, there are still many problems in China’s government in fulfilling its responsibilities and running performance evaluation mechanisms.

Government bans on the use of generative-AI for initial grant application evaluation limits the use of this technology. However, this research shows that a post hoc evaluative approach within the domain of Responsible AI provides a means by which government agencies can evaluate the big data collected through their grant programs. This proposed framework, Responsible AI for Evaluation (RAI-E), achieves this goal by curating big governmental administrative data using grant evaluation rubrics followed by model fine-tuning for agency-specific evaluation tasks. Convergence between model- and human-generated evaluations then enables robust diagnosis of grant program equity and fairness via Responsible AI and algorithm auditing methods. Preliminary experiments show improved model performance through the instruction-tuning of open source language models for evaluating government grant applications. Further research will explore the auditing of the underlying algorithms, devising a method for algorithm-in-the-loop frameworks to aid government administrators in evaluating their human-driven program performance.",2024-12-15,2025-10-16 11:42:58,2025-10-16 11:42:58,,8222-8224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData),,,,Algorithm Auditing; Artificial intelligence; Big Data; Convergence; Data models; Data privacy; Decision making; Government; Government Administration; National Institutes of Health; Public Policy; Responsible AI; Security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence From the Big Data Bureau in China,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,,1558-0040,10.1109/TEM.2023.3307599,,"Digital government transformation (DGT) is a major reform toward modernized governance. It provides a new pattern to manage environmental pollution and promote sustainable development goals. Thus, in this study, a quasi-natural experiment using the Big Data Bureau (BDB) of China is conducted to investigate the impact of DGT on corporate environmental violation (CEV) via a multiperiod difference-in-differences model. DGT is found to inhibit CEV. The pressure from government environmental regulation and public environmental scrutiny play important roles as mechanisms of the effect. In addition, the impact of DGT on firms exhibits heterogeneity under different conditions. The environmental effect of DGT is stronger in BDBs for e-administrative services than BDBs for industrial development, and DGT works better at inhibiting CEV for state-owned enterprises and firms in regions with high digitalization.

Big data analytics technology is mainly applied in business intelligence, government decision-making, public services and so on. Factor analysis is one of the methods in classical statistics, which can only give the distribution degree and variation of data based on the mean value, and can not reflect the characteristics of data objects changing with time, so it is not suitable for solving the statistical analysis problem of big data objects based on time series. In order to make up for the deficiency of factor analysis of big data with time series, according to the characteristics of time series in grey system, that is, grey system theory devotes itself to the discussion of realistic laws through the generation and development of sequences, while mathematical statistics devotes itself to the study of statistical historical laws. Combining the advantages of grey system and classical factor analysis, this paper proposed a new model, namely grey factor analysis applied on bigdata analysis layer, and implemented systematically by using object-oriented programming method. Finally, this method is applied to big data analytics. The results are analyzed and compared, and the effect is remarkable and best forecasting.

As quoted in1, capturing all queries made on the company website or from customer support calls, emails or chat lines, regardless of their outcome, may have significant value in identifying emerging trends. The Big Data Era has largely contributed in accelerating the development strategic plans issued from governments and research organisms, coving the management, exploitation and analysis of these data by taking into account the different V's of Big Data. Among these plans, we can cite for instance the development of: (a) large-scale platforms (ex. data-clusters, distributed data clusters), (b) Software Defined Environments (SDE) (ex. IBM SDE), (c) advanced programming paradigms (ex. map-reduce, Spark, etc.), Data Analytics Tools (Rapid Miner, Google Fusion Tables, Solver), (d) Visualization tools (Google Chart, Tableau, Oracle Visual Analyzer), and (h) high quality and valuable Knowledge Bases (KB), constructed either by academicians (e.g., Cvc, DBpedia, Freebase, and YAGO) and industrials (e.g., Google Knowledge Graph, Facebook Knowledge Graph, Amazon Knowledge Graph, Credit Rating Agencies, Enterprise Knowledge Base, etc.). In this talk, we would like to foster the creation of a think tank dedicated to getting the best from Big Data V's and the efforts related to it to revisit our research activities without compromising them. In this talk, we would like to share the experience conducted with our Model and Data Engineering Team of the LIAS Laboratory at ISAE-ENSMA, which aims at the design of data warehousing applications. Based on the literature, this design is based on two main approaches: (i) a supply-driven approach (also called data-driven) that starts with an analysis of operational data sources in order to identify all the available data and (ii) a user-driven approach (also known as requirement-driven or goal-orientated) which stems from the determination of the information requirements of different business users. Several studies and experiments show that resorting to these two approaches entails a high risk for companies, since some functional requirements cannot be satisfied. This is due to the lack of relevant data in sources. In parallel, reference studies have identified the crucial role of knowledge bases (KB) for analytical tasks, by offering analysts more entities (people, places, products, etc.). The availability of a huge, high quality valuable KB is an asset for data warehousing designers and decision-makers to construct/exploit a valuable data warehouse. So, faced with this situation, we here present a value-driven approach that revisits the traditional life cycle of the design of data warehouses, by considering KB as an external resource. These different phases are illustrated via the YAGO KB.",2017-12-17,2025-10-16 11:42:58,2025-10-16 11:42:58,,3-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Abbreviation: 2017 First International Conference on Embedded & Distributed Systems (EDiS),,,,Big Data; Companies; Conferences; Data warehouses; Distributed databases; Knowledge based systems; Warehousing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 First International Conference on Embedded & Distributed Systems (EDiS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, many governments, researchers, and organizations have been driven by open data pioneers, to make their data available for public. Transportation data, such as public bus performance data, is an example of open big data. The analyzing of these open big data can be used in social services. For example, bus service operators might get a vision into time delays in bus services by processing and mining public bus performance data. Then, making ameliorative steps (e.g., adding more buses, rerouting some bus routes, etc.) results in improving the feeling of the passenger. We provide a Bayesian framework, which is applied on big data obtained from transportation system. Specifically, a number of Bayesian networks have been used in our framework to predict whether a bus will arrive late or early at a specific bus stop. We investigate and establish the optimum network settings and/or parameter permutations for each (bus stop, bus route, arrival time)-triplet. The results demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian framework effectively supports predictive analytics on big transportation data collected from the City of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.",2022-09-12,2025-10-16 11:42:58,2025-10-16 11:42:58,,1-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: 2022 IEEE Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, Intl Conf on Cloud and Big Data Computing, Intl Conf on Cyber Science and Technology Congress (DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech)",,,,Bayes methods; big data; Big Data; big data analytics; big data applications; big data management; big data systems; Data systems; Delay effects; Government; open big data; Transportation; Urban areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2022 IEEE Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, Intl Conf on Cloud and Big Data Computing, Intl Conf on Cyber Science and Technology Congress (DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basically, big data refers to a huge amount of datasets and that dataset can be stored in the form of structured or unstructured format. Those datasets are producing in every second via a wide range of sources such as Facebook and Twitter. The big data has a basic three pillars- Volume (size), Variety (types) and Velocity (speed). Big data is a prediction platform where lots of dataset are available in the form of raw material, so we need an appropriate technique to process it and predict some valuable information for the present as well as future use. The sampling techniques are applicable to handle large datasets where all data sets are not possible to process at a time. In this situation, the sampling techniques play a very important role in the processing of big huge data. In this paper, we have proposed a parameter estimation model for big data to predict the mean size of large data by using the sampling technique. The proposed model can reduce the processing time as compare to the existing model because the sampling mechanism is to select small sample (n) from the entire datasets (N) and estimate the unknown parameters which are known as prediction results.

However, most of the existing privacy preserving models cannot to be used to resist attacks with continuously growing background knowledge. This paper presents the method of applying differential privacy to protect the citizens' privacy information. By generalizing the citizens' sensitive information, the anonymity sets satisfying (K, L)-anonymity model are constructed, then differential method is used to add Laplace noise in the anonymity sets. Thus the citizen's privacy information can be protected even if the attacker gets strong background knowledge. Because the grouped information reduces the sensitivity of the query, the availability of citizens' information after adding noise can be guaranteed.

While substantial research has been conducted on the technical aspects of BDA adoption, little research has been conducted on the organizational aspects. Furthermore, the small amount of research conducted on organizational factors occurred in the private sector and was constrained to if the organizational context influenced adoption outcomes rather than how the organizational context influenced outcomes. The purpose of this parallel, nested mixed-methods study is to provide a deep exploration of how and why varying forms of organizational architecture impact the outcomes of BDA adoption in U.S. public sector organizations. The theoretical significance of this ongoing research will be to fill a gap in the literature exploring the impact of organizational forms on BDA adoptions as a system, generally, and the dearth of research on public sector organizations, specifically. The practical contribution of this research will be to reduce uncertainty associated with organizational factors, allowing public sector managers to make risk-informed decisions on BDA adoption.

The speed and frequency by which data is produced and collected - by an increasing number of sources - is responsible for today's data deluge: the amount of available digital data is projected to increase by an annual 40%. “Big Data for Development” is a concept that refers to the identification of sources of Big Data relevant to policy and planning of development programmes. It differs from both “traditional” development data and what the private sector and mainstream media call Big Data. Potential applicability of “Big Data for Development” at the most general level, when it is properly analysed, these new data can provide snapshots of the well-being of populations at high frequency, high degrees of granularity, and from a wide range of angles, narrowing both time and knowledge gaps. This research discussed several possible implementations of Big Data to the official statistics in Indonesia. Furthermore, three case studies would be discussed: (1) predicting inter-city commuting patterns using twitter, (2) developing a statistical model to nowcast food prices using crowdsourcing, and (3) Mobile Position Data for Tourism Statistics. The results show similar trend between crowdsourcing approach and BPS Survey for all commodities, between the twitter approach and the commuter survey 2014. For the MPD approach for tourist statistics, the number of visits based on the roaming and the visits based on the immigration are similar.

Additionally, globalization, technological development, and the changing roles of individuals in society will require entirely new approaches, tools, and capabilities to help inform decision making under uncertain conditions. However, the mismatch between the high disaster vulnerability and the low crisis response and disaster resilience becomes a critical problem for emergency management. Recent years, key advances in computing — smartphones, worldwide mobile internet access, social media and industrial big data have all contributed to break through barriers of information exchange which help disaster managers working on data-driven solutions to disaster management problems. Based on big data, the emergency managers can identify and assesse risk through critical infrastructure operating data or sensor data, and then predict the affected population through smartphone data or social media data, and finally provide an operation plan for establishing the target capabilities for a community to response to the crisis. Also, big data plays a part in providing real-time clues of on-site disaster information through data mining. Based on the analyzed real-time disaster information, the research creates real-time feedback loops on nature disaster to help the decision-makers make the real-time update, precision and dynamic rescue plan.

The policy is developed by studying the political and social issues in holistic way. System Dynamics based on Big Data from e-government infrastructure is suggested as the method for obtaining a comprehensive solution. The solution is selected from some possible scenarios by running simulation on the model of System Dynamics. The policymaker uses this solution as an input for public policymaking. Unfortunately, no E-Government Maturity Model (EMM) has given attention to incorporate Big Data and System Dynamics for Public Policymaking. In this case, a new EMM is proposed. It consists of several stages. Each stage is identified by the range of intensity or level of several criteria or indicators. Some criteria or indicators are proposed by considering technical and non-technical aspect, such as Leadership / Policy, IT Infrastructure, Information Processing (Application), Human Resources and Organization Culture.

Ensuring the integrity and subsequent auditability of such big data is essential for the performance of AI-driven data analysis. Recent years has witnessed the emergence of many big data auditing schemes that are often characterized by third party auditors (TPAs). However, the TPA is a centralized entity, which is vulnerable to many security threats from both inside and outside the cloud. To avoid this centralized dependency, we propose a decentralized big data auditing scheme for smart city environments featuring blockchain capabilities supporting improved reliability and stability without the need for a centralized TPA in auditing schemes. To support this, we have designed an optimized blockchain instantiation and conducted a comprehensive comparison between the existing schemes and the proposed scheme through both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation. The comparison shows that lower communication and computation costs are incurred with our scheme than with existing schemes.",2019,2025-10-16 11:43:09,2025-10-16 11:43:09,,6288-6296,,,7,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big data; Big Data; blockchain; Cloud computing; data auditing; Reliability; Security; Smart cities; smart city,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, inspired by the works of network representation; we propose a Semantic Graph-Based method to combine structure information of semantic graph and context information of terms together for nontaxonomic relationships identification. Second, different semantic types of verb sets are extracted based on the dependency syntactic information, which are ranked to act as non-taxonomic relationship labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. The F1 value reaches 81.4% for identification of non-taxonomic relationships.

We analyze the existing body of evidence and establish trustworthiness requirements for AI-enabled automated decision-making (ADM) in the public sector, identifying eighteen aggregate facets. We link these facets to dimensions of trust in automation and institution-based trust to develop a theory-oriented research framework. We further map them to the OECD AI system lifecycle, creating a practice-focused framework. Our study has theoretical, practical and policy implications. First, we extend the theory on technological trust. We also contribute to trustworthy AI literature, shedding light on relatively well-known requirements like accountability and transparency and revealing novel ones like context sensitivity, feedback and policy learning. Second, we provide a roadmap for public managers and developers to improve ADM governance practices along the AI lifecycle.

Therefore, this study examines how big data analytics (BDA) may be methodically incorporated into various phases of the health policy cycle for fact-based and precise health policy decision-making. So, this study explores the potential of BDA for accurate and rapid policy-making processes in the healthcare industry. A systematic review of literature spanning 22 years (from January 2001 to January 2023) has been conducted using the PRISMA approach to develop a conceptual framework. The study introduces the emerging topic of BDA in healthcare policy, goes over the advantages, presents a framework, advances instances from the literature, reveals difficulties and provides recommendations. This study argues that BDA has the ability to transform the conventional policy-making process into data-driven process, which helps to make accurate health policy decision. In addition, this study contends that BDA is applicable to the different stages of health policy cycle, namely policy identification, agenda setting as well as policy formulation, implementation and evaluation. Currently, descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics are used for public health policy decisions on data obtained from several common health-related big data sources like electronic health reports, public health records, patient and clinical data, and government and social networking sites. To effectively utilize all of the data, it is necessary to overcome the computational, algorithmic and technological obstacles that define today's extremely heterogeneous data landscape, as well as a variety of legal, normative, governance and policy limitations. Big data can only fulfill its full potential if data are made available and shared.

In recent years, organizations have started to capitalize on the significant use of big data for analyses to gain valuable insights to improve decision-making processes. In this regard, leveraging and unleashing the potential of big data has become a significant success factor for steering firms' competitiveness, and the related literature is increasing at a very high pace. Thus, the authors propose a bibliometric study to understand the most important insights from these studies and enrich existing conceptual models. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors use a bibliometric review on articles related to the use of big data for firms' competitiveness. The authors examine the contributions of research constituents (authors, institutions, countries and journals) and their structural and thematic relationships (collaborations, co-citations networks, co-word networks, thematic trends and thematic map). The most important insights are used to enrich a conceptual model. Findings Based on the performance analysis results, the authors found that China is by far the most productive country in this research field. However, in terms of influence (by the number of citations per article), the most influential countries are the UK, Australia and the USA, respectively. Based on the science mapping analysis results, the most important findings are projected in the common phases of competitive intelligence processes and include planning and directions concepts, data collection concepts, data analysis concepts, dissemination concepts and feedback concepts. This projection is supplemented by cross-cutting themes such as digital transformation, cloud computing, privacy, data science and competition law. Three main future research directions are identified: the broadening of the scope of application fields, the specific case of managing or anticipating the consequences of pandemics or high disruptive events such as COVID-19 and the improvement of connection between firms' competitiveness and innovation practices in a big data context. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study show that the most important research axis in the existing literature on big data and firms' competitiveness are mostly related to common phases of competitive intelligence processes. However, concepts in these phases are strongly related to the most important dimensions intrinsic to big data. The use of a single database (Scopus) or the selected keywords can lead to bias in this study. Therefore, to address these limitations, future studies could combine different databases (i.e. Web of Science and Scopus) or different sets of keywords. Practical implications This study can provide to practitioners the most important concepts and future directions to deal with for using big data analytics to improve their competitiveness.

In Brazil, few studies have addressed this issue. Thus, here I analyze the political agenda and economic dynamics involved in the transformation of Brazil's second largest city, Rio de Janeiro, into a climate-smart city. I develop an original conceptualization of “techno-utopian smart city” and apply this framework to analyze the case of Rio. Empirically, I perform a thematic content analysis, including the coding of policy documents, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest that the smart city agenda is still limited to address the challenges of climate change. While smart city and climate policies have been sparsely integrated, “smart” urbanism has privileged the financial, economic, and political dividends of a techno-driven urban transformation, rather than focusing on citizen well-being, climate change mitigation, and adaptation. My conceptualization and empirical analysis suggest that Rio de Janeiro has been i) framing climate governance as a technical issue instead of a complex social challenge, ii) neglecting the environmental footprint of smart technologies, and iii) collecting citizens’ private data with low levels of transparency.",2022-12-01,2025-10-16 11:49:49,2025-10-16 11:49:49,,270-281,,2,2,,Urban Governance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Brazil; climate change; public policy; Rio de Janeiro; smart cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim is to deliver an insight into the opportunities, challenges, impacts, and future scenarios regarding the application of the emerging technologies. The paper finds that whilst uptake of non-relational and distributed databases is occurring, it remains largely at the level of proof-of-concept, demonstrator or pilot. Scaled uptake is occurring slower than anticipated, and to a lesser degree than in other sectors. However, the broader and longer-term impacts on the land sector remain difficult to judge. Meanwhile, emerging distributed analytical databases appear to be under-exploited or at least underexplored within the land sector. Overall, the examined technologies are seen to enable new operational approaches for conventional land sector transactions, and also entirely new land related services, digital products, and actors: the ways and means of holding, transferring, and securing land may become more nuanced, fractionalized, and/or automated.

Despite the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, there is a concerning gap—i.e., local governments often exhibit a cybersecurity posture that is inadequately prepared to counter the rising cyber threats. This discrepancy underscores the urgency for a comprehensive understanding of the challenges restricting effective cybersecurity in local governmental settings. This paper aims to elucidate these challenges of local governments in a structured framework utilising a systematic literature review method named the PRISMA protocol. The findings reveal that the stakes are high when it comes to cybersecurity for local governments, with the key challenges being financial resource constraints, technological vulnerabilities, human factors, and the regulatory framework. This study recommends improving interdepartmental coordination, adopting relevant policies, and executing targeted cybersecurity training to address these challenges. The study also highlights unconventional approaches to mitigate financial and skill resource limitations, including the utilisation of open-source security tools, outsourcing specific cybersecurity functions, and establishing collaborations with local cybersecurity agencies, academic institutions, and the private sector to obtain expertise and advanced resources.

A substantial amount of agency administrative information – big data – can be transformed into knowledge for policy and management actions through a rigorous information generation process. Important properties of the information generation process are that it must generate accurate, timely information while protecting the confidentiality of the clients. In addition, it must be extensible to serve an ever-changing policy and technology environment. Knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD), aka data science, is a method developed in the private sector to mine consumer data and can be used in public settings to support evidence based governance. KDD consists of a rigorous 5-step process that includes a Web-based end-user interface. The relationship between KDD and governance is a continuous feedback cycle that enables ongoing development of new information and knowledge as stakeholders identify emerging needs. In this paper, we synthesis the different frameworks for utilizing big data for public governance, introduce the KDD process, describe the nature of big data in child welfare, and then present an updated KDD architecture that can support these frameworks to utilize big data for governance.

To establish a sustainable urban existence, smart cities use some new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Drones (IoD), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The created data by these technologies are submitted to analytics to obtain new information for increasing the smart societies and cities' efficiency and effectiveness. Also, smart traffic management, smart power, and energy management, city surveillance, smart buildings, and patient healthcare monitoring are the most common applications in smart cities. However, the Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) approach all hold a lot of promise for managing automated activities in smart cities. Therefore, we discuss different research issues and possible research paths in which the aforementioned techniques might help materialize the smart city notion.

The rise of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and big data has created rapidly evolving and complex privacy landscapes. However, privacy is often treated as a static construct, failing to reflect the fluid, context-dependent nature of user concerns. This oversimplification has led to fragmented research, inconsistent findings, and limited capacity to address the nuanced challenges posed by these technologies. Understanding these dynamics is especially crucial in fields such as digital health and informatics, where sensitive data and user trust are central to adoption and ethical innovation. Objective This study synthesized existing research on privacy behaviors in emerging technologies, focusing on IoT, AI, AR, and big data. Its primary objectives were to identify the psychological antecedents, outcomes, and theoretical frameworks explaining privacy behavior, and to assess whether insights from traditional online privacy literature, such as e-commerce and social networking, apply to these advanced technologies. It also advocates a context-dependent approach to understanding privacy. Methods A systematic review of 179 studies synthesized psychological antecedents, outcomes, and theoretical frameworks related to privacy behaviors in emerging technologies. Following established guidelines and using leading research databases such as ScienceDirect (Elsevier), SAGE, and EBSCO, studies were screened for relevance to privacy behaviors, focus on emerging technologies, and empirical grounding. Methodological details were analyzed to assess the applicability of traditional privacy findings from e-commerce and social networking to today’s advanced technologies. Results The systematic review revealed key gaps in the privacy literature on emerging technologies, such as IoT, AI, AR, and big data. Contextual factors, such as data sensitivity, recipient transparency, and transmission principles, were often overlooked, despite their critical role in shaping privacy concerns and behaviors. The findings also showed that theories developed for traditional technologies often fall short in addressing the complexities of modern contexts. By synthesizing psychological antecedents, behavioral outcomes, and theoretical frameworks, this study underscores the need for a context-contingent approach to privacy research. Conclusions This study advances understanding of user privacy by emphasizing the critical role of context in data sharing, particularly amid ubiquitous and emerging health technologies. The findings challenge static views of privacy and highlight the need for tailored frameworks that reflect dynamic, context-dependent behaviors. Practical implications include guiding health care providers, policy makers, and technology developers toward context-sensitive strategies that build trust, enhance data protection, and support ethical digital health innovation.

This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive systematic review and bibliometric analysis of 1153 scholarly and grey literature sources published between 1998 and April 2025. Our dual-method approach traces the conceptual evolution of DPI, maps key thematic trajectories, and critically examines whether DPI constitutes a genuine innovation or a reconfiguration of prior digital government paradigms. The analysis reveals a predominant focus on exploratory and practice-oriented studies, with limited empirical and longitudinal research. Notably, current framings position DPI in techno-solutionist terms, while overlooking crucial socio-technical elements, including legal and institutional infrastructures, digital readiness, and regional interoperability. In response to these gaps, we propose a more nuanced and multidimensional definition of DPI that integrates overlooked non-technical components. We further posit that DPI should not be reduced to technical artefacts but recognised as a dynamic socio-technical construct with profound implications for inclusivity, public value, and sustainable digital transformation. Our findings contribute to clarifying the conceptual boundaries of DPI and advancing a more grounded understanding that can inform both academic research and institutional practice. We conclude with a forward-looking research agenda, calling for interdisciplinary research, participatory policy design, and context-sensitive evaluation frameworks for DPI implementation.",2025-09-01,2025-10-16 11:49:49,2025-10-16 11:49:49,,100593,,3,11,,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Digital governance; Digital public infrastructure (DPI); E-government; Open innovation; Public value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the challenges that big data collection and analytics can introduce in trust-based societies, like those of Scandinavia, are not yet understood. For instance, in the energy sector, data generated through smart appliances, like smart metering devices, can have collateral implications for the end-users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of scientific articles indexed in Scopus to identify possible relationships between the practices of collecting, processing, analysing, and using people's data and people's responses to such practices. We contextualise this by looking at research about Scandinavian societies and link this to the academic literature on big data and trust, big data and smart meters, data ethics and the energy sector, surveillance capitalism, and subsequently performing a reflexive thematic analysis. We broadly situate our understanding of culture in this context on the interactions between cognitive norms, material culture, and energy practices. Our analysis identified a number of articles discussing problems and solutions to do with the practices of surveillance capitalism. We also found that research addresses these challenges in different ways. While some research focuses on technological amendments to address users’ privacy protection, only few examine the fundamental ethical questions that discuss how big data practices may change societies and increase their vulnerability.

These issues negatively impact the liveability of African cities. Despite the potential of smart mobility to address some issues, there is a notable gap in research exploring the aspects of smart mobility that are applicable and effective in the context of emerging economies. This paper explores smart mobility research trends in Africa. A bibliometric analysis technique was used to extract 608 documents from the Scopus and Web of Science core collections, which were analysed using Biblioshiny in R. The results reveal that many studies focused solely on technological solutions, are fragmented, and lack network- or city-wide mobility solutions. Previous research has not considered user perspectives or the likely socio-economic impact of smart mobility. The growth in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics, coupled with the need for personalised and seamless travel, is driving smart mobility research in Africa. Most papers were authored by researchers with African affiliations but based at foreign institutions. The African countries represented are limited to Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and South Africa. There are also low levels of intra-African research collaboration. Further, only 14 documents specifically focused on transport in Africa.

E9LTSCXD,journalArticle,2020,"Gravili, Ginevra; Manta, Francesco; Cristofaro, Concetta Lucia; Reina, Rocco; Toma, Pierluigi",Value that matters: intellectual capital and big data to assess performance in healthcare. An empirical analysis on the European context,Journal of Intellectual Capital,,1469-1930,10.1108/JIC-02-2020-0067,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S146919302000036X,"Purpose The aim of this paper is to analyze and measure the effects of intellectual capital (IC), i.e. human capital (HC), relational capital (RC) and structural capital (SC), on healthcare industry organizational performance and understanding the role of data analytics and big data (BD) in healthcare value creation (Wang et al., 2018). Through the assessment of determined variables specific for each component of IC, the paper identifies the guidelines and suggests propositions for a more efficient response in terms of services provided to citizens and, specifically, patients, as well as predicting effective strategies to improve the care management efficiency in terms of cost reduction. Design/methodology/approach The study has a twofold approach: in the first part, the authors operated a systematic review of the academic literature aiming to enquire the relationship between IC, big data analytics (BDA) and healthcare system, which were also the descriptors employed. In the second part, the authors built an econometric model analyzed through panel data analysis, studying the relationship between IC, namely human, relational and structural capital indicators, and the performance of healthcare system in terms of performance. The study has been conducted on a sample of 28 European countries, notwithstanding the belonging to specific international or supranational bodies, between 2011 and 2016. Findings The paper proposes a data-driven model that presents new approach to IC assessment, extendable to other economic sectors beyond healthcare. It shows the existence of a positive impact (turning into a mathematical inverse relationship) of the human, relational and structural capital on the performance indicator, while the physical assets (i.e. the available beds in hospitals on total population) positively mediates the relationship, turning into a negative impact of non-IC related inputs on healthcare performance. The result is relevant in terms of managerial implications, enhancing the opportunity to highlight the crucial role of IC in the healthcare sector. Research limitations/implications The relationship between IC indicators and performance could be employed in other sectors, disseminating new approaches in academic research. Through the establishment of a relationship between IC factors and performance, the authors implemented an approach in which healthcare organizations are active participants in their economic and social value creation. This challenges the views of knowledge sharing deeply held inside organizations by creating “new value” developed through a more collaborative and permeated approach in terms of knowledge spillovers. A limitation is given by a fragmented policymaking process which carries out different results in each country. Practical implications The analysis provides interesting implications on multiple perspectives. The novelty of the study provides interesting implications for managers, practitioners and governmental bodies. A more efficient healthcare system could provide better results in terms of cost minimization and reduction of hospitalization period. Moreover, dissemination of new scientific knowledge and drivers of specialization enhances best practices sharing in the healthcare sector. On the other hand, an improvement in preventive medicine practices could help in reducing the overload of demand for curative treatments, on the perspective of sharply decreasing the avoidable deaths rate and improving societal standards. Originality/value The authors provide a new holistic framework on the relationship between IC, BDA and organizational performance in healthcare organizations through a systematic review approach and an empirical panel analysis at a multinational level, which is quite a novelty regarding the healthcare. There is little research focussed on healthcare industries' organizational performance, and, specifically, most of the research on IC in healthcare delivered results in terms of theoretical contribution and qualitative analyzes. The authors even contributed to analyze the healthcare industry in the light of the possible existence of synergies and networks among countries.",2020-09-02,2025-10-16 11:49:50,2025-10-16 11:49:50,,260-289,,2,22,,Journal of Intellectual Capital,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big data analytics; Healthcare; Intellectual capital; Knowledge sharing in healthcare; Organizational value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It considers the technical aspects of accounting, how accounting affects the society in which it operates (the social role), and expectations as to what accounting should – or should not – do (the moral role). Design/methodology/approach The case of Italy is investigated, and a pragmatic discourse analysis methodology is used to conduct documentary research. Developments in SDG reporting in Italy are examined and assessed as a possible model for other EU member states. Findings The government budgetary processes and SDG initiatives in Italy are evolving. The role of budgeting supported by a sufficiently detailed and multi-purpose chart of accounts is an important consideration. Furthermore, digitalisation can provide support by facilitating the categorisation, classification and tagging of expenditure items. Italian practices show that accounting can assume a technical role in the process of SDG achievement, but the underlying subjectivity involved does not facilitate the consideration of the social and moral aspects. The solutions used may be acceptable for decision-making at a micro level but may encounter resistance at the macro level due to the social and moral expectations of government budgeting, including the budget’s legal aspects.

Extending the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) framework, we identify four distinct digital innovation strategies in the public sector: enhancement-oriented, anticipatory, adaptive, and persistent. Our findings reveal that enhancement-oriented and persistent strategies are the most prevalent, reflecting a strong focus on internal value creation through process optimization and long-term organizational change. In contrast, adaptive and anticipatory strategies are less common. We find a near-equal prevalence of incremental and transformational goals, indicating balanced strategic orientation.

However, without robust smart city data governance, much of the urban data potential remains underexploited, resulting in inefficiencies and missed opportunities for city administrations. This study addresses these challenges by establishing specific, actionable requirements for smart city data governance models, derived from expert interviews with representatives of 27 European cities. From these interviews, recurring themes emerged, such as the need for standardized data formats, clear data access guidelines, and stronger cross-departmental collaboration mechanisms. These requirements emphasize technology independence, flexibility to adapt across different urban contexts, and promoting a data-driven culture. By benchmarking existing data governance models against these newly established urban requirements, the study uncovers significant variations in their ability to address the complex, dynamic nature of smart city data systems. This study thus enhances the theoretical understanding of data governance in smart cities and provides municipal decision-makers with actionable insights for improving data governance strategies.

E-government projects have altered how government institutions communicate, share content, collaborate, and interact with citizens. Nowadays, e-government systems are crucial resources for facilitating government work and interaction with other people and organizations to co-operation with each other. Despite the availability of authentic research studies on the trend of e-government, there is still a need to conduct a comprehensive review and combine findings from earlier studies, as well as to define the current issues surrounding e-participation in the context of e-government initiatives. Objective The main aim of this study is to review the previous literature to explore and understand the issues surrounding e-participation within the context of e-government initiatives, and to what extent these issues impact the success of these initiatives. Method In this study, a systematic review method has been used to gather, analyze, and synthesize data regarding the accuracy and value of previous articles. This method followed a predefined review protocol and used both automated and manual research methods to find all the relevant research papers that were published in digital databases between 2010 and 2020. Results According to the review study, we extracted 211 articles that addressed the key issues that negatively affected the level of e-participation, which were analyzed by following a systematic mapping method that collected significant information to fulfill the research aim. We classified and investigated the published papers that addressed a broad range of topics, including three crucial issues: user acceptance, interaction, and participation. As a result of the weight analysis, computer self-efficacy and perceived ease of use were found to be the best predictors of whether people want to use e-government systems. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and service quality were also found to be promising predictors of satisfaction with e-government services that need more study. Conclusions This systematic review found a high need for more research on this vast topic, as e-participation is critical to e-government performance and is evolving with ICT. Finally, this study will help academics understand current limitations, obstacles, and gaps, as well as future research opportunities in e-participation.",2022-12-01,2025-10-16 11:49:50,2025-10-16 11:49:50,,100015,,,8,,Telematics and Informatics Reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E-government; E-participation; Potential factors; Weight analysis technique,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to materialize the transformative potential of AI, public sector organizations need to successfully assimilate AI in their operational activities. However, AI assimilation in the public sector appears to be fragmented and lagging the private sector, and the phenomena has really limited attention from academic research community. To address this gap, we adopt the case study approach to explore three Saudi-Arabian public sector organizations and analyze the results using the attention-based view of the organization (ABV) as the theoretical lens. This study elucidates the challenges related AI assimilation in public sector in terms of how organizational attention is focused situated and distributed during the assimilation process. Five key challenges emerged from the cases studied, namely (i) misalignment between AI and management decision-making, (ii) tensions with linguistics and national culture, (iii) developing and implementing AI infrastructure, (iv) data integrity and sharing, and (v) ethical and governance concerns.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as a means of identifying appropriate controls to mitigate risks associated with the protection of personal data. However, little is currently known about how to conduct such a DPIA in a Big Data Analytics context. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of identifying privacy and data protection risks specific to the Big Data Analytics context that could negatively impact individuals' rights and freedoms when they occur. Based on a sample of 159 articles, we applied a thematic analysis to all identified risks which resulted in the definition of nine Privacy Touch Points that summarise the identified risks. The coverage of these Privacy Touch Points was then analysed for ten Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) methodologies.

To achieve this, we employed a three-phase research methodology: 1) identifying resources, 2) conducting content analysis, and 3) using the Delphi method. Our findings indicate that only half of the cities explicitly address big data in their strategies, and most lack adequate data protection measures. Additionally, the paper presents a list of recommendations for big data management and data protection, derived from measures found in Smart City strategies and validated by domain experts through the Delphi method.

While these technological changes have prompted some observers to forecast the end of bureaucracy, data from many countries show that bureaucratic public organizations are not disappearing. In this article, we argue that this paradox can be explained by revisiting some of the foundational work of sociologist Max Weber, who envisioned public administration itself as a bureaucratic machine.

The study uses a quantitative research methodology to survey 400 public sector employees to establish the correlation between organizational culture, leadership, technology, and ambidexterity. The study validates these factors' importance to ambidexterity using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The study reveals that a supportive organizational culture and transformational leadership positively influence ambidextrous capabilities, while technology adoption moderates the impact of leadership and culture on ambidexterity. Furthermore, the findings reinforce the hypotheses that human capital and employee flexibility facilitate ambidextrous strategies, mainly when supported by technology. However, the study identifies factors like organizational silos, resistance to change, and resource scarcity, which are the main barriers to ambidexterity. Therefore, the study contributes to the literature by proposing a context-specific framework for ambidexterity in the UAE’s public sector.

Objective: Although a myriad of research exists on software analytics as well as on Agile software development (ASD) practice on itself, there exists no systematic overview of the research done on ASD from a data analytics perspective. Therefore, the objective of this work is to make progress by linking ASD with Big Data analytics (BDA). Method: As the primary method to find relevant literature on the topic, we performed manual search and snowballing on papers published between 2011 and 2019. Results: In total, 88 primary studies were selected and analyzed. Our results show that BDA is employed throughout the whole ASD lifecycle. The results reveal that data-driven software development is focused on the following areas: code repository analytics, defects/bug fixing, testing, project management analytics, and application usage analytics. Conclusions: As BDA and ASD are fast-developing areas, improving the productivity of software development teams is one of the most important objectives BDA is facing in the industry.

Typically, companies hold massive amounts of data within their servers, which might include previously offered services, proposals, bids, and so on. They rely on their expert managers to manually analyse them in order to make strategic decisions. However, given the huge amount of information to be analysed and the necessity of making timely decisions, they often exploit a small amount of the available data, which often does not yield effective choices. For instance, this happens in the context of the e-procurement domain, where bids for new calls for tender are often formulated by looking at some past proposals from a company. Driven by an extensive experience on the e-procurement domain, in this paper we propose an intelligent system to support organisations in the focused crawling of artefacts (calls for tender, BIMs, equipment, policies, market trends, and so on) of interest from the web, semantically matching them against internal Big Data and knowledge sources, so as to let companies analysts make better strategic decisions. The novel contribution consists of a proper extension of the K-means algorithm used by a web crawler within the proposed system, and a semantic module exploiting search patterns to find relevant data within the crawled artefacts. The proposed solution has been implemented and extensively assessed in the e-procurement domain. It has been successively extended to other domains, such as robot programming, cloud providing, and several other domains. Since to the best of our knowledge in the literature do not exists similar systems, in order to prove its effectiveness we have compared its crawling component against similar crawlers, by plugging them within our system.",2021-12-01,2025-10-16 11:49:50,2025-10-16 11:49:50,,115560,,,184,,Expert Systems with Applications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big Data analytics; Big Data visualisation; Data clustering; Focused crawling; Intelligent system; Natural language processing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain more insights into the domain, we use 394 Scopus-indexed documents to explore the thematic evolution and explore future research directions. We found that the topics related to AI, ML, and big data for natural resource management have increased significantly since 2012. While “Remote Sensing” is the most productive journal, S. Alqadhi and J. Mallick are the most contributing authors, and the United States has been the most contributing country. While the keywords “sustainable development” and “remote sensing” have been growing steadily since 1975, “natural resource modeling” and “machine learning” have been more popular during the last few years. The thematic analysis reveals that the existing literature is concentrated around four clusters, and the content analysis of the clusters uncovers 15 future research agendas. These research agendas include the development of efficient strategies for NRM, understanding the role of AI and ML in natural resource management, leveraging data-driven methods for decision-making, and developing models for interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches. The study provides important implications of using technology in NRM. These technologies help policymakers create effective policies, improves assessment and decision-making, and optimizes resource use. These advancements benefit society by increasing access to essential resources in a fair manner, and they have positive impacts on both the public and private sectors, enabling evidence-based policymaking and responsible resource extraction.

Recent frameworks for AI governance help to operationalize these by identifying the processes and layers of governance in which they must be considered, but do not provide public sector workers with guidance on how they should be pursued or understood. This analysis explores how the concept of sustainable AI can help to fill this gap. It does so by reviewing how the concept has been used by the research community and aligning research on sustainable development with research on public sector AI. Doing so identifies the utility of boundary conditions that have been asserted for social sustainability according to the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development, and which are here integrated with prominent concepts from the discourse on AI and society. This results in a conceptual model that integrates five boundary conditions to assist public sector decision-making about how to govern AI: Diversity, Capacity for learning, Capacity for self-organization Common meaning, and Trust. These are presented together with practical approaches for their presentation, and guiding questions to aid public sector workers in making the decisions that are required by other operational frameworks for ethical AI.",2022-02-01,2025-10-16 11:49:50,2025-10-16 11:49:50,,101926,,,68,,Technology in Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AI governance; Artificial intelligence; Public administration; Social sustainability; Sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In its original formulation, the concept of hegemony had two defining features: firstly, it was conceived of as a society-wide, macroscopic formation and second as self-reinforcing i.e. self-replicating. This article argues that the rise of big-data in public relations is a hegemonic development that further re-enforces the current institutional logics and power in the three main spheres of society: corporate, governance and civic. Using the economic notion of externalities, the authors argue that loss of agency over personal data is the unpriced, unrecognized externality that drives the big-data market. This externality is dependent on those who are the losers of agency not having the requisite information, power or resources to negotiate alternatives that might re-dress the balance. As users and proponents of the use of big data, the public relations profession has a number of key questions to answer if it is not to re-inforce arguments that it is a hegemonizing force in organizations and society. Normal economic remedies to address externalities are not adequate to a case that is both ethical as well as economic in nature. The article therefore concludes with five arguments that the public relations profession should debate to provide leadership within organisations and society.",2020-06-01,2025-10-16 11:49:50,2025-10-16 11:49:50,,101902,,2,46,,Public Relations Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big data; Ethics; Externalities; Hegemony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, organizations have a high appetite for big data, and there is growing evidence that investments in big data solutions do not always lead to the derivation of intended value. Accordingly, there is a need for rigorous academic guidance on what factors enable effective use of big data. With this paper, we aim to guide IS researchers such that the expansion of the body of knowledge on the effective use of big data can proceed in a structured and systematic manner and can subsequently lead to empirically driven guidance for organizations. Namely, with this paper, we cast a wide net to understand and consolidate from literature the potential factors that can influence the effective use of big data, so they may be further studied. To do so, we first conduct a systematic literature review. Our review identifies 41 factors, which we categorize into 7 themes, namely data quality; data privacy and security and governance; perceived organizational benefit; process management; people aspects; systems, tools, and technologies; and organizational aspects. To explore the existence of these themes in practice, we then analyze 45 published case studies that document insights into how specific companies use big data successfully. Finally, we propose a framework for the study of effective use of big data as a basis for future research.

The idea, with both smart vehicles and smart cities, is that more data leads to better, more informed decisions. Smart vehicles and smart cities would acquire data from their own equipment (e.g., cameras, sensors) and from their connections—e.g., connections to fellow smart vehicles, to road-side infrastructure, to smart transportation systems (STSs), etc. Unfortunately, the paradigm of smart vehicles in smart cities is rife with danger and ripe for misuse. One vulnerable system or service could become an attacker's entry point, facilitating access to every connected vehicle, device, etc. Worse, smart vehicles and smart cities are inherently cyber-physical; a cyberattack can have physical consequences, including destruction of infrastructure and loss of life. Lastly, to leverage all the benefits of smart vehicles in smart cities, we would need to accept exorbitant levels of data collection and surveillance, which, in the absence of ironclad privacy protections, could lead to total lack of privacy. In this work, we define the automotive context—i.e., smart vehicles—within the larger context of smart cities as our threat landscape. Then, we enumerate and describe all of the (1) threats, (2) attack surfaces & targets, (3) areas of concern (indirect vulnerabilities & threats), and (4) impacts of smart vehicles in smart cities. Our objective is to demonstrate that the dangers are real and imminent—in the hope that they will be addressed before an attack on the “smart vehicles in smart cities” paradigm results in loss of life.",2025-02-01,2025-10-16 11:49:50,2025-10-16 11:49:50,,100871,,,51,,Vehicular Communications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Automotive; Connected and autonomous vehicle; Cybersecurity; Smart city; Smart transportation system; Threat landscape,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet the role of power dynamics embedded in political contexts, particularly in non-Western countries, in shaping public sector innovation (PSI) has remained underexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining how power dynamics at multiple levels and critical junctures have shaped PSI trajectories over time in Ukraine. Drawing on historical institutionalism and using a context-specific critical interpretive synthesis of 84 studies from 1991 to 2022, we reveal how critical junctures intensified PSI and enabled new innovation priorities. However, these moments were deeply conditioned by existing power dynamics across international, national and subnational political levels. While some innovations contributed to the redistribution of power, others were stalled or fragmented owing to path dependencies. This study makes two primary theoretical contributions: first, it reconceptualizes political context as a dynamic, multilevel arena of vertical and horizontal power contestations that shapes PSI; second, it extends PSI theory by demonstrating how critical junctures operate as temporally bounded periods of constrained agency, cumulatively shaping innovation trajectories. These insights advance our understanding of the complex interplays between political contexts, power dynamics, and temporality in PSI.",2025-12-01,2025-10-16 11:49:50,2025-10-16 11:49:50,,105322,,10,54,,Research Policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Historical institutionalism; Political context; Political transition; Power; Public sector innovation; Ukraine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The paper presents case data from advanced digitalised services in Finland based on in-depth interviews with eighteen service professionals. Citing a broad range of literature, the paper carefully defines meaningfulness and co-creation in the context of long-term social and healthcare services and using a Vygotskian approach to social learning, it provides evidence of how context influences perceptions of successful change and of meaningfulness. In doing so, the paper suggests that the context for these digitalised services is best viewed from: (a) the stakeholder ecosystem, (b) the service context and (c) the service delivery framework.

However, people have varying possibilities and capabilities for using (digital) technologies. This intertwines the technology-driven urban development with the ideal of inclusiveness (or the lack thereof) as it seems unrealistic to assume that smart cities would benefit equally the whole society. This controversy is approached by questioning whether smart cities can really improve the living conditions of the disadvantaged via reviewing the literature that ties technology-driven urban development to persons with disabilities. The study shows, first, that disabilities are rarely discussed in the extant literature on smart cities particularly from a critical perspective. Second, it is underlined here, based on the reviewed literature, that while smart city initiatives hold promise for enhancing urban living conditions of persons with disabilities, they are not one-size-fits-all answers to tackle the marginalization of persons with disabilities. Rather, since technological solutions do not counter the fundamental barriers of exclusion, urban technologies still need advanced ideas in establishing a truly inclusive smart city.",2024-11-01,2025-10-16 11:49:50,2025-10-16 11:49:50,,105334,,,154,,Cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Disabilities; Inclusiveness; Smart city; Sustainable development goals; Technology-driven urban development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of these benefits, it is imperative to learn the antecedents and underlying mechanisms for this to maintain and enhance engagement. Objective The aim of this study is to determine the factors and influencing mechanisms related to citizen engagement with the TikTok account of the National Health Commission of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using a web crawler, 355 short videos were collected from the Healthy China account on TikTok (with more than 3 million followers throughout China), covering the period from January 21, 2020, to April 25, 2020. The title and video length, as well as the number of likes, shares, and comments were collected for each video. After classifying them using content analysis, a series of negative binomial regression analyses were completed. Results Among the 355 videos, 154 (43.4%) related to guidance for clinicians, patients, and ordinary citizens, followed by information concerning the government’s handling of the pandemic (n=100, 28.2%), the latest news about COVID-19 (n=61, 17.2%), and appreciation toward frontline emergency services (n=40, 11.3%). Video length, titles, dialogic loop, and content type all influenced the level of citizen engagement. Specifically, video length was negatively associated with the number of likes (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.19, P<.001) and comments (IRR=0.39, P<.001). Title length was positively related to the number of shares (IRR=24.25, P=.01), likes (IRR=8.50, P=.03), and comments (IRR=7.85, P=.02). Dialogic loop negatively predicted the number of shares (IRR=0.56, P=.03). In comparison to appreciative information, information about the government’s handling of the situation (IRR=5.16, P<.001) and guidelines information (IRR=7.31, P<.001) were positively correlated with the number of shares, while the latest news was negatively related to the number of likes received (IRR=0.46, P=.004). More importantly, the relationship between predictors and citizen engagement was moderated by the emotional valence of video titles. Longer videos with positive titles received a higher number of likes (IRR=21.72, P=.04) and comments (IRR=10.14, P=.047). Furthermore, for short videos related to government handling of the pandemic (IRR=14.48, P=.04) and guidance for stakeholders (IRR=7.59, P=.04), positive titles received a greater number of shares. Videos related to the latest news (IRR=66.69, P=.04) received more likes if the video title displayed higher levels of positive emotion. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, videos were frequently published on government social media platforms. Video length, title, dialogic loop, and content type significantly influenced the level of citizen engagement. These relationships were moderated by the emotional valence of the video’s title. Our findings have implications for maintaining and enhancing citizen engagement via government social media.",2021-02-01,2025-10-16 11:50:45,2025-10-16 11:50:45,,,,2,23,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,citizen engagement; COVID-19; dialogic loop; emotion valence; government social media; public health crisis; TikTok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To tackle this issue, this article sets out to answer the research question: what is the role of digital government in the transition towards a circular economy? Driven by this research question, we conduct a review on 88 empirical studies in the Information Systems (IS) and digital government fields and discuss existing research foci and gaps in relation to the types of digital technologies used, the types of stakeholders involved, the stages of the product life cycle, and the type of resources that governments draw on to advance the circular economy transition.

The theoretical framework of invisible work was tool in analysis. The findings show that records management and RM professionals in Finnish municipalities are invisible when looked through the factors that previous studies have shown to be related invisible work. RM profession in Finnish municipal organizations is strongly fragmented and gendered and the work is done in informal structures sometimes by temporary personnel. The connection of these factors to invisible work and especially their implications to public sector organizations' records management have not gain much attention in earlier research. Therefore, in order to promote trustful e-government more future studies that examine the visibility of the records management work and RM professionals in different public sector organizations are needed.",2020-10-01,2025-10-16 11:50:45,2025-10-16 11:50:45,,101460,,4,37,,Government Information Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E-government; Invisible work; Mixed methods approach; Municipal organization; Records management; Records management professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required. Reframing the Agenda, while aligning the sustainable development and digitalization policies, seems advisable to ensure a holistic sustainability. The findings aim at guiding and stimulating further research and science-policy dialogue on the promising nexus amid the SDGs and digitalization.",2021-01-20,2025-10-16 11:50:45,2025-10-16 11:50:45,,122204,,,280,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Digitalization; ICT; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals (SDGs),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

System insecurity and privacy leakage were found to arouse worries among the app-users while their awareness of protecting personal data was found to have room for improvement. Islands of real-time parking information occur as a result of the lack of collaboration among private carpark operators.

The promise of data to help address societal issues and foster innovation requires public organizations to work together with businesses and researchers. Data collaboratives whereby actors collaborate to share and use data for public good gain increasing interest. Most of these collaborations, however, tend to be one-off, small, and limited in impact due to a complex web of legal, technical, ethical, commercial, and organizational challenges. Initiators of data collaboratives, termed as conveners, can potentially alleviate some of these concerns by playing various roles in developing a more sustainable data ecosystem for the data collaboratives. Our study investigates what convener roles are perceived to be critical in developing data collaboratives. By drawing on data ecosystems thinking, we developed a framework of convener roles and sub-roles which we further used to analyze four cases in the Netherlands and Sweden. We conclude that connecting role and learning catalyst role are critical at the initiation stage, while stimulating and mediating roles emerge as future critical roles as the data ecosystem develops. We further identified convener meta-roles that are associated with particular data ecosystem structures (keystone-centric, marketplace-based, intermediary-based, and platform-centric).

This study conducted Q-methodological interviews among data professionals employed in the mobility domain in Estonia—a leading digital society—who work in public, private, and third-sector organisations.

Combining the novel technique of structural topic modeling (STM) and qualitative narrative analysis, this paper examines the policy narratives in 33 countries’ AI policies. We uncover six common narratives that are dominating the political agenda concerning AI. Our findings show that the policy narratives' saliences vary across time and countries. We make several contributions. First, our narratives describe well-grounded, supportable conceptions of AI among governments, and show that AI is still a fairly novel, multilayered, and controversial phenomenon. Building on the premise that human sensemaking is best represented and supported by narration, we address the applied rhetoric of governments to either minimize the risks or exalt the opportunities of AI. Second, we uncover the four prominent roles governments seek  to take concerning AI implementation: enabler, leader, regulator, and/or user. Third, we make a methodological contribution toward data-driven, computationally-intensive theory development.

While due to their own boundary definitions none of these traditional disciplines could claim “ownership” to the emerging domain, the disciplines were jointly indispensable to provide their various perspectives. As a consequence, the study domain has evolved as a multi-disciplinary endeavor increasingly fostering interdisciplinary relationships. An important contributor to forming the Digital Government research domain in this way also appears to be attributable to the impact of the Digital Government Reference Library (DGRL), which has regularly recorded, updated, and published bibliographical references to the vast majority of peer-reviewed DG research published in the English language for over a decade and a half. Besides its original curatorial purpose of findability and ease of bibliographic organization of DGR-focused research, over the years the DGRL has increasingly also been used for the purpose of bibliometric studies of some kind and some range.

The literature yet presents a limited number of references explicitly concerning the topic of qualified data acquisition. In this sense, the present literature review aims to update the joint subject of IoT and vital signs, seeking to understand the state-of-the-art and future directions. We have analyzed 78 articles and IoT manufacturer websites that address vital signs collection to answer a group of primary and specific questions. In particular, we revisited architectures, communication protocols, data acquisition mechanisms, evaluation metrics, and how to efficiently transfer data through the lens of sensors, actuators, and healthcare.

At the same time, in the context of novel possibilities that artificial intelligence (AI) brings to governments in terms of understanding and developing collective behavior analysis, important concerns related to citizens' privacy have emerged. In order to identify the main uses that governments make of AI and to define citizens' concerns about their privacy, in the present study, we undertook a systematic review of the literature, conducted in-depth interviews, and applied data-mining techniques. Based on our results, we classified and discussed the risks to citizens' privacy according to the types of AI strategies used by governments that may affect collective behavior and cause massive behavior modification. Our results revealed 11 uses of AI strategies used by the government to improve their interaction with citizens, organizations in cities, services provided by public institutions or the economy, among other areas. In relation to citizens' privacy when AI is used by governments, we identified 8 topics related to human behavior predictions, intelligence decision making, decision automation, digital surveillance, data privacy law and regulation, and the risk of behavior modification. The paper concludes with a discussion of the development of regulations focused on the ethical design of citizen data collection, where implications for governments are presented aimed at regulating security, ethics, and data privacy.

In the knowledge management (KM) domain, a clear characterization of the BSD paradigm can lead to more effective and efficient KM strategies, processes and systems that leverage a huge amount of structured and unstructured data sources. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology based on a mixed analysis approach (unsupervised machine learning and human-based) applied to 199 research articles on BSD topics extracted from Scopus and Web of Science. In particular, machine learning processing has been implemented by using topic extraction and hierarchical clustering techniques. Findings The paper provides a threefold contribution: a conceptualization and a consensual definition of the BSD paradigm through the identification of four key conceptual pillars (i.e. sources, properties, technology and value exploitation); a characterization of the taxonomy of BSD data type that extends previous works on this topic; a research agenda for future research studies on BSD and its applications along with a KM perspective. Research limitations/implications The main limits of the research rely on the list of articles considered for the literature review that could be enlarged by considering further sources (in addition to Scopus and Web of Science) and/or further languages (in addition to English) and/or further years (the review considers papers published until 2018). Research implications concern the development of a research agenda organized along with five thematic issues, which can feed future research to deepen the paradigm of BSD and explore linkages with the KM field. Practical implications Practical implications concern the usage of the proposed definition of BSD to purposefully design applications and services based on BSD in knowledge-intensive domains to generate value for citizens, individuals, companies and territories.

Through a textual analysis that distinguishes innovation procurement from general government purchases, this study investigates the effects and underlying mechanisms of government innovation procurement on the innovation efficiency of peer firms. We find that government innovation procurement significantly enhances peer firms' innovation efficiency. Our mechanism analyses reveal that government innovation procurement sends positive signals, increasing peer firms' citations of procured firms' patents, thereby improving their innovation efficiency. The heterogeneity analyses indicate that this positive relationship is more pronounced when peer firms occupy comparable market positions, operate in regions with high-speed rail, have common analysts with the procured firms, and are classified as high-tech enterprises. We also find that central government procurement, cross-regional procurement, and evaluation methods involving “competitive consultation and negotiation” significantly enhance peer firms' innovation efficiency.

The morphological tagging and named-entity recognition as the core of natural language processing was described. A hybrid method based on learning rules and an ensemble of machine learning methods has been developed for sentiment analysis and covert propaganda. The proposed rule-based model allows choosing the class-based lexical approach or on collected dictionaries. The combination of the methods based on dictionaries and rules with the ensemble of machine learning models are developed. The developed stacking model combines weak classifiers and deformed meta-attributes based on the results of pairwise multiplication. Finally, the distorted features are used together with the training dataset in the meta-model. This combination avoids the correlation of the results of weak classifiers and increases the generalizability of the model.

A systematic literature review was conducted to obtain a structural overview and consolidate the knowledge from CP literature, given the dearth of review articles in this domain. The methodology included systematic selection of literature in phases and mixed-method systematic review process consisting of bibliometric analysis and qualitative review. This enabled an understanding the main characteristics of CP literature and answer how CP has been addressed at farm level. 1516 publications were selected in first phase after which 652 were screened using bibliometric analysis software, VOSviewer and CiteSpace, in second phase to identify research hotspots and recent trends. Optimization, irrigation, sustainability, adaptation were certain hotspots, while a shift in research trend was observed from decision support, crop allocation and bioenergy to climate change, water resources and big data. Last phase focussed on qualitative review of 31 publications on farm. Three broad themes of articles emerged namely “farmer's decision-making”, “soil-water-agroecology” and “merits of innovative technologies”. The study proposed several recommendations for small farming systems which were largely ignored in literature. These include factorial design for crop combinations, choices in options, estimation of crop diversity index and relative time-dispersion in yields. The current review produced a macroscopic overview of accumulated knowledge on CP and provided future directions to harness the unexplored potential in this field.",2025-04-01,2025-10-16 11:50:45,2025-10-16 11:50:45,,100139,,2,3,,Farming System,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bibliometric analysis; Cropping system; Decision making; Farming system; Systematic literature review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their actual implementation often reveals significant shortcomings that hinder their potential for value creation. This study addresses a critical gap in the literature by evaluating the design of OGD policies in Spain, focusing specifically on the industrial sector at the autonomous community level. The research assesses the available data's content, formats, and licensing through a population-based analysis of all datasets labeled under the “industry” category across the 17 Spanish autonomous communities. The findings reveal a fragmented and inconsistent landscape: of over 46,000 datasets published by autonomous community governments, only 532 were initially labeled as industry-related, and after a rigorous selection process—removing duplicates, outdated records, and mislabeling entries—only 316 were deemed valid. The study highlights a predominance of non-reusable formats such as HTML and a lack of standardisation in the categorization of information. While most datasets use open licenses (mainly Creative Commons BY), the variability in download options and formats limits their automated processing and reuse. These results underscore the need for standardization criteria, improved data quality, and strategic alignment of OGD initiatives with sectoral priorities such as industrial competitiveness and sustainability.

Therefore, in 2016, the American Society of Radiation Oncology performed an evaluation of research grant funding for RO. Methods and Materials Members of the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiation Oncology Programs (SCAROP) were asked about funded and unfunded grants that were submitted by their departments between the fiscal years 2014 and 2016. Grants were grouped according to broad categories defined by the 2017 American Society of Radiation Oncology Research Agenda. Additionally, active grants in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools database were collated using RO faculty names. Results Overall, there were 816 funded (44%) and 1031 unfunded (56%) SCAROP-reported grants. Total grant funding was over $196 million. The US government funded the plurality (42.2%; 345 of 816) of grants compared with nonprofit and industry funders. Investigators from 10 institutions accounted for >75% of funded grants. Of the funded grants, 43.5% were categorized as “genomic influences and targeted therapies.” The proportion of funded to unfunded grants was highest within the category of “tumor microenvironment, normal tissue effects, and reducing toxicity” (53.4% funded). “New clinical trial design and big data” had the smallest share of SCAROP grant applications and the lowest percent funded (38.3% of grants). NIH grants to RO researchers in 2014 to 2016 accounted for $85 million in funding. From the 31 responding SCAROP institutions, there was a 28% average success rate for RO proposals submitted to the NIH during this period.

However, the literature remains fragmented, with researchers in social science disciplines like public administration and political science, and the fast-moving fields of AI, ML, and robotics, all developing concepts in relative isolation. Although there are calls to formalize the emerging study of AI in government, a balanced account that captures the full depth of theoretical perspectives needed to understand the consequences of embedding AI into a public sector context is lacking. Here, we unify efforts across social and technical disciplines by first conducting an integrative literature review to identify and cluster 69 key terms that frequently co-occur in the multidisciplinary study of AI.

And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind.

Addressing the gap in research on creative sector data's role and place in urban data ecology, it applies de Kerckhove's (1998) “Connected Intelligence” theoretical model to propose a three-pillar assessment framework for Smart Cultural Data Intelligence across urban policies, data infrastructure and governance. A Singapore case study, chosen for its dual smart and creative city agendas, employs triangulation methodology: policy analysis, governance mapping, and data infrastructure assessment. Findings reveal a policy disjuncture between Singapore's creative and smart city initiatives, limitations in public participation, and the need for robust, integrative data systems to enable cross-sector data sharing for sustainable urban planning. The Singapore case highlights challenges and opportunities in strategically positioning cultural data within a smart city context to recommend a unified policy framework with inclusive data governance and enhanced infrastructure to facilitate cross-sector collaboration. These recommendations emphasize a holistic approach balancing technology, people, and policies. The proposed intelligence evaluation framework is well placed to identify the best practices and challenges in cultural data integration to foster sustainable urban development across cities.

However, there is no empirical evidence of the extent of applications and the permeability level in ensuring the three resources’ security. This study explored the relationship of the fourth industrial revolution technologies and the water, energy, and food nexus by evaluating the applications of the various technologies of 4IR on WEF nexus and examined the effect of 4IR on WEF nexus. The objectives were achieved using the qualitative methodology and bibliometric analysis of content analysis. The result showed that most fourth industrial revolution technologies had not been integrated with the WEF nexus. The result showed that only the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data analytics had permeated the nexus, which shows that data of the resources will be the foundation of the nexus. The systematic collection, accuracy of data, and empirical analysis of data will determine the level of security of WEF nexus. The qualitative results show that there are applications of the fourth industrial revolution technologies to the individual sectors of the nexus, birthing Water 4.0, Energy 4.0, and Food 4.0. The Bibliometric analysis result shows that the integration of the fourth industrial revolution with the WEF nexus will lead to cleaner production practices relating to the technological processes of water, energy, and food resources. These practices will ensure the environment's safety from WEF wastes and the water, energy, and food security in production processes. The empirical research and bibliometric analysis result, rooted in the concept of cleaner production, shows that the fourth industrial revolution affected the WEF nexus. The effects are; the birth of clean technologies & industrial applications, the catalyst for sustainability security of WEF nexus leveraging on life cycle thinking, enablement of technological transfer, enhancement of economic growth, and urban planning. The study concludes that the fourth industrial revolution technologies affect WEF nexus, ensuring the popularization of cleaner production strategies and processes of the resources during trade-offs and synergies. The study recommends the integration of a cleaner production concept in WEF processing.

We performed a systematic literature review to understand how institutional change could be applied to research on Accounting Information Systems (AIS), using a quantitative method to categorize data through LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) technique; and a qualitative method performed by hierarchical categorical content analysis as a basis for inferences. We reviewed 309 articles using Institutional Theory in accounting and AIS. The LSA results presented the main topics of study, subfields of research, and uses of Institutional Theory. Regarding accounting research, it is possible to identify the role of institutional forces in the IFRS adoption (in private and public sectors), XBRL adoption, and disclosure of information on organizations’ environmental, social, and governance, with a focus on analyses at the organizational level and regulatory pressures. A deep dive into AIS articles showed that Institutional Theory was applied to analyze the adoption of systems/technologies (mostly ERP and XBRL) through isomorphic processes (coercive, mimetic, and normative). We proposed to analyze digital technologies as an exogenous change for the digital transformation in accounting business using another perspective of Institutional Theory: institutional change. Institutional change analyzes the role of destabilizing elements in the change of an organizational field as a whole and not just in a few organizations. In this perspective, technology is the agent of change on a broader level, transforming organizations, individuals, customers, suppliers, and governments. The main contribution of this article is presenting suggestions for future AIS.

But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.",2021-05-01,2025-10-16 11:50:46,2025-10-16 11:50:46,,101527,,,22,,Environmental Technology & Innovation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Disruptive digital technologies (DDTs); Innovation; Managerial perspective; Non-adoption; Smart real estate; Technology adoption barriers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas compliance with land use regulations and activities in the study areas tend to promote sustainability,non-compliance with these regulations on the other hand threatens urban sustainability. For example, in the Ho Poly Area, there was no evidence of encroachment of the buffer zones of overhead power lines and arterial roads. This indicates that there is compliance with land use regulations, and this has positive implications for the sustainability of the city. However, there were no provisions for urban green spaces in the neighbourhood plan, which raises concerns on the ecological and general sustainability of the city. On this backdrop, the researchers recommend stricter enforcement and the adoption of effective urban planning strategies such as institutional collaboration to achieve sustainable city development. Additionally, adopting emerging techniques such as big data, machine learning, and IoT for urban planning and management in these Ghanaian cities can enhance sustainable development.",2025-03-01,2025-10-16 11:50:46,2025-10-16 11:50:46,,79-93,,1,5,,Urban Governance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Land use regulations; Land uses; Non-compliance; Sustainable city development; Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Focused on connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), this study proposes an integrated analytical framework for a dedicated open data platform (ODP). By integrating thematic analysis with process landscape and stakeholder analysis methods, we present a holistic CAV-ODP model positioned to optimize benefits across industries, public sectors, and society as a whole. We argue that multiple stakeholders can enhance both supply and demand aspects of the CAV-ODP, catalyzing activities such as data access, management, transformation, incubation, coordination, education, and application. Importantly, it advocates for government-led integration of interests spanning private and public domains, fostering a collaborative social network for data application and innovation. This inquiry not only reveals the social benefits generated by open CAV data but also underlines the significance of the CAV-ODP platform as an innovative governance arrangement, serving as a catalyst for a culture of sharing, bolstering collaborative governance, and preserving public value amid disruptive technological changes.

This study examines the development of NPFM scholarship over the past 25 years, focusing on 3 foundational works that have substantially shaped this field (i.e. Olson et al., 1998, 2001; Guthrie et al., 1999). The study identifies key research themes within these foundational works and provides insights into the field’s emerging warnings and research directions. Design/methodology/approach Our structured literature review collected 325 research articles from 1999 to 2024 from the Scopus database. These articles were chosen for their references to three key foundational works and were systematically analysed based on predefined NPFM themes. This was further enhanced by a traditional literature review of selected articles within each NPFM category, offering an analysis of NPFM scholarship and identifying potential future research paths. Findings In examining the focus of the sampled articles among the five NPFM themes, we found that the majority have centred on the themes of financial reporting and performance measurement systems.

Design/methodology/approach This paper identifies three types of studies on the influence of ML on MA issued between 2015 and 2021 in mainstream accounting journals, by professional accounting bodies and by large consulting companies. Findings First, only very few academic articles actually show examples of using ML or using different algorithms related to MA issues. This is in contrast to other research fields such as finance and logistics.

Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews a certain amount of previously published literature but is based mainly on analysis of the very large number of responses to a consultation paper on geospatial data published by the UK Government. Findings The findings are that while there is strong appreciation of the potential benefits of using geospatial data, there are many barriers to the development, sharing and use of geospatial data, ranging from problems of incompatibility in data definitions and systems to regulatory issues. The implication for governments and for providers and users of geospatial data relates to the need to take a long-term approach to planning in resolving the issues identified. Research limitations/implications The research findings are limited to the UK, but similar findings would be likely in any other large Western country. Practical implications This paper confirms the need for a strong and coherent approach to the planning of geospatial data and systems for the establishment of a clear basis for the different parties to work together and the need to clearly separate the roles of the government in establishing frameworks and standards and the role of the private sector in developing applications and solutions. Social implications Society is increasingly dependent on the use of geospatial data, in improving living standards and dealing with social problems.

A wide range of definitions surfaced over the last decade characterising the smart city, primarily pushed by the global elite corporations and influential academics. Simultaneously, a series of urban development expressions, such as digital city, knowledge city, eco-city is used interchangeably with the smart city, significantly mystifying the reading of the concept. This paper, first argue that smart city interpretation needs and requires the input and contribution of the local stakeholders. The aim of this research is to provide an evidence-based framework to capture the perception of local urban actors in India vis-à-vis their interpretation of smart cities given the existing urban conditions and the proposed developments under the 100 Smart Cities Mission. This research also examines the underlying linkage between the smart city and its conceptual relatives and highlights the ones with a significant convergence with the emerging urban agenda in India's Smart Cities Mission. The analysis presented in this paper show that to emerge as a holistic concept, smart cities definition models should engage with the sustainability and community issues, beyond the use of digital technology. The research reveals that the Indian urban stakeholders strongly associate the smart city concept with sustainable city and eco-city, much more than the technology-loaded phrases such as ubiquitous city and digital city.

The current understanding of the progress of MaaS is based on the handful of studies that have explored pilot initiatives carried out mainly in Europe and North America. In contrast, this paper extends the literature by exploring the evolution of MaaS in mainland China. It examines how the concept of MaaS emerged in China, identifies and maps on-going MaaS initiatives and platforms across Chinese cities, and investigates the most common approaches and models of MaaS delivery. The analysis reveals that while Chinese government policy has long discussed integrated transport, MaaS and related aspects, including ‘one-stop’ mobility services and ‘Chuixing Ji Fuwu’, which is the Chinese translation of Mobility-as-a-Service, have only appeared in recent times. At present, 41 Chinese cities are hosting ongoing MaaS initiatives and associated platforms. These are concentrated in the developed eastern regions, in cities with high political influence and larger populations. The geography of MaaS strongly reflects the prevailing digital divide in China, implying that deliberate policy choices are needed to avert widening transport and mobility inequalities in the age of MaaS. MaaS platforms currently only provide basic information and modal/service integration and are deployed either as bespoke applications or added to existing social media and navigation applications. Two main models of MaaS delivery were identified: public-controlled model that is predominant and centered primarily on integrating existing state-run public transport services, and partnership model that is emerging in cities such as Beijing to integrate more mobility services beyond conventional public transport. The complex landscape of actors associated with the emerging public–private partnership model presents new challenges for transport governance, especially in balancing an established tradition of strong public sector control over transport on the one hand, and the interests of the fledgling private sector mobility service providers on the other hand.",2023-09-01,2025-10-16 11:50:46,2025-10-16 11:50:46,,101054,,,13,,Case Studies on Transport Policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,China; Future mobility; Integrated transport; MaaS; Mobility-as-a-service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The premise is that most mainstream discourses implicitly assume that smart city projects will empower and improve the lives of citizens. However, their role is often ambiguous. While some visions of the smart city are characterised by the absence of citizen’s voices, others are populated by active citizens operating as urban sensors. Furthermore there are fearful visions of a future in which citizens will be subjugated by technologies that will hamper their freedom.

From a systems perspective, PDG encompasses four core dimensions and exhibits the distinctive characteristics of holism-emergence and independence-modularity. Drawing upon the framework of open innovation, this study investigates the key mechanisms through which PDG influences the digital technology innovation performance (DTIP) of enterprises. Utilizing a dynamic panel model based on data from Chinese provincial governments and listed firms, the paper inspects a benchmark effect and examines the transmission pathways through mediating, moderating, and threshold effect models. The empirical results reveal several findings. First, within the open innovation context, the enhancement of PDG directly improves DTIP, while the presence of CTO-equivalent positions within firms contributes to heterogeneity under the impact of PDG. Second, PDG enhances DTIP through multiple parallel mediating mechanisms, including the accumulation of information capital, the reduction of technological blockade, the promotion of knowledge integration, and the acceleration of corporate digitalization. Additionally, a chain mediating mechanism is identified, wherein PDG influences regional digital homogeneity, thereby facilitating corporate digitalization, finally impacts DTIP. Third, regional innovation and entrepreneurship activity positively moderates the relationship between PDG and DTIP, whereas corporate attention to digitalization exhibits a nonlinear threshold effect. This study conceptualizes the key dimensions of PDG from a systems theory perspective, unpacks the underlying mechanisms linking PDG to DTIP and offers valuable implications for understanding the coordinated development of public digital governance and firm innovation performance.",2025-12-01,2025-10-16 11:50:46,2025-10-16 11:50:46,,103001,,,83,,Technology in Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Digital technology; Innovation performance; Open innovation; Public digital governance (PDG),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the growth of AI and its limited exploration in many business strategies, especially when collaboration among SC partners’ is established, this paper focuses on defining the lines of research and application of AI in CN processes, by presenting insights into how AI can improve the resilience and the antifragility. It examines the integration of AI in CN processes from the following perspectives: (i) the collaborative processes addressed among the CN partners, (ii) the decision-making level of the collaborative processes performed, (iii) the SC partners involved in the collaboration; (iv) the technologies combined with AI to support CN processes; (v) the programming languages implemented to develop AI algorithms; (vi) the SC sectors in which AI is mainly implemented to perform collaborative processes; and (vii) the potential of implementing AI in CN processes, in an increasingly turbulent and disruptive business world. The study focuses on SC in various sectors, including food, transport, logistics, manufacturing, healthcare or electronics, among others. In addition, the review provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between collaborative processes and AI-driven advances, identifying the technologies that can merge with AI to support CN processes.

Novel use of big data storage and programming models can improve news recommendation systems through efficient handling and analysis of clickstream data and a better understanding of users' interests. Most existing approaches to news recommendation consider users' clicks as the implicit feedback to understand user behaviors. However, “clicks” may not be an effective indicator of real user interests. We address this problem by developing a novel news recommendation system based on a news utility model. Given the new utility model, we propose a two stage news recommendation framework. The framework first generates article-level recommendation rules based on the utility model, then integrates the notion of utility and probabilistic topic models and generates topic-level recommendation rules. We argue that the proposed utility-based news recommendation system also addresses the news cold start problem which is one of the most challenging obstacles for news agencies.

Objective This study aims to examine the evolution, impact, and prospects of digital health interventions in low- and middle-income countries, highlighting their role in improving health care accessibility and equity. Methods A retrospective analysis of digital health initiatives scanning the past two and a half decades focused on the progression from basic SMS platforms to sophisticated mobile health apps and other health digital interventions. Relevant literature and case studies were reviewed to elucidate key milestones, successes, challenges, and opportunities in advancing digital health initiatives in low- and middle-income regions. Results Digital health initiatives in low- and middle-income countries initially targeted specific health concerns, such as malaria diagnosis and treatment, through text-based platforms, demonstrating their efficacy in reaching remote and marginalized communities. With the proliferation of mobile phone ownership and internet access, these interventions evolved into comprehensive mobile health apps, facilitating self-care support, patient education, chronic disease monitoring, and remote consultations. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption of digital health interventions, particularly in disseminating health information, supporting contact tracing efforts, and enabling virtual consultations to alleviate strain on health care systems. Conclusions The future of digital health interventions in low- and middle-income countries holds immense promise, fueled by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain. However, challenges persist in ensuring equitable access to digital health technologies, addressing disparities in digital literacy, and establishing robust health care infrastructure.

Indeed, smart infrastructure (SI) development is a prerequisite for smart cities (SCs). However, inadequate funding and expertise for such SI development pose profound challenges that may be partially addressed by mobilising private finance and efficiencies through collaborative public–private partnership (PPP) models. This paper provides a holistic review and analysis of the relevant literature, as a basis for proposing such PPP models for developing SI.

The empirical analysis of the temporal co-author network can trace the emerging authors and knowledge bursts over time. Design/methodology/approach The study applied social network theory to trace the author collaboration patterns in the domain of e-governance. Analysis of the co-author network using micro and macro parameters was done to trace the temporal evolution of the author collaborations. Findings E-governance is a multi-disciplinary research domain split over streams of management, politics, information technology and electronics. Hence, research collaborations play a significant role in its advancement. The knowledge sharing between individual authors, institutions and groups through research collaborations, resulting in extensive sharing of data, equipment and research methods, has boosted research activities and development in e-governance. In this paper, the authors systematically analyse the current scenario of research collaborations in the area of e-governance using co-author network to estimate its impact on the advancement of the field. The authors also analysed the temporal evolution of the co-author networks, which show remarkable growth of research collaborations in the domain of e-governance from the year 2000. Research limitations/implications The co-author network analysis is only a proxy measure for the analysis of research collaborations. The names of the authors and the university affiliations used in the article are as retrieved from the research repository of Scopus. The degree, citations and other parameters related with authors have scope only within the environment of the co-author network used in the analysis. The criteria used in the study is limited to the degree of research collaborations and the number of co-authored publications in the giant component of the co-author network.

This paper seeks to address this paradox by seeking to better understand what analytics is, and how operational research is related to it. To do so literature from a range of academic disciplines is analysed, in what is conceived as concurrent histories in the shared tradition of a management paradigm spread over the last 100 years. The findings of this analysis reveal new insights as to how operational research exists within an ecosystem shared with several other disciplines, and how interactions and ripple effects diffuse knowledge and ideas between each.

Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is an integrated system that through a single online interface enables commuters to plan, book, and pay for trips which utilise a range of mobility providers. MaaS has a unique characteristic to provide a system into which new service options can be integrated with traditional transportation modes. This makes MaaS a potential alternative to private vehicle ownership, and a means to overcome some of the negative externalities associated with automobile dependency. To realise this potential, many cities have implemented—or are in the process of implementing—MaaS trials to better understand how this service will function within cities. This paper utilises a systematic literature review to extract insights, and develops a conceptual framework to identify barriers and risks related to MaaS adoption in cities. The study findings reveal that: (a) the desired MaaS outcomes are associated with reduced vehicle kilometres travelled, increased trip awareness, reduced parking, reduced vehicle ownership, and improved social equity; (b) MaaS supply side barriers include public private cooperation, business support, service coverage, shared vision, and data and cyber security; (c) MaaS demand side barriers are its lack of appeal to older generations, public transport users, and private vehicle users, the attractiveness of the digital platform, and user willingness-to-pay.",2021-02-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,103036,,,109,,Cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS); Smart city; Smart mobility; Social exclusion; Transportation disadvantage; Transportation-as-a-Service (TaaS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While public managers are increasingly supportive of OGD initiatives worldwide, researchers note that they also carefully select which data to release to balance openness with traditional values of professionalism and secrecy as well as concerns about cyber incidents and privacy. Understanding the factors that influence this micro-level choice is important to make valuable types of data publicly accessible. Using 2018 survey data from a nationally representative sample of 2500 department heads in 500 small and medium-sized US cities, we look at variation in public managers' level of comfort with making different types of government data open - from criminal records to government employee salary data. We find that managerial comfort reflects historic practices of public accessibility and privacy concerns with individual data. Managers who believe OGD creates positive outcomes for society are more comfortable with publicly disclosing all types of data.

We reviewed the ISO 27002 Information Security standard with extant literature and found that operational security, individual awareness and compliance matters pose more significant government challenges than the often-highlighted technical and process-oriented cloud security requirements. This study identifies and explores the critical factors associated with information security requirements of cloud services within the Australian regional local government context.

This analogy seems useful: like the exhaust and use of chemical compounds, the omnipresent generation and subsequent use of personal data can impact individuals as well as society as a whole. Similarly to the effects of industrialisation, adverse side-effects of datafication on individuals, societies and ecosystems could manifest themselves only years later and in seemingly unrelated contexts. Industrialised societies have enacted laws in response to the adverse environmental effects of industrialisation. Theories from modern sociology and public awareness have played a significant role in this process. Similarly, the European Union has enacted the General Data Protection Regulation to address the risks of processing of personal data. But laws tend to come only after any negative impact has become sufficiently apparent. This has spurred the introduction of precaution- and discourse-based management of unknown risks. The GDPR appears to implement these risk management mechanisms less extensively than current environmental protection laws. As with the effects of industrialisation, the side-effects of datafication cannot be entirely known in advance. Privacy is currently a prime concern, but datafication can also affect entire societies if it results in a “digital panopticon”. Considering the influence of Risk Society Theory and Normal Accident Theory, two important social theories concerning industrial hazards, this article proposes a number of areas where future iterations of data protection law can be developed.",2017-10-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,603-617,,5,33,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Data protection; Environmental law; General Data Protection Regulation; Normal Accident Theory; Risk Society Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very few studies have summarized the influence of governance in solving the problems of SMEs in one place. So, a systematic literature review has been made to find the role of governance in solving the problems of SMEs.

This research found that open government is generally conceptualized as a new governing structure emphasizing both transparency (vision) and public participation (voice). However, it also identifies a “transparency-driven focus” for both the case selection of academic studies and practical implementation, which represents a gap between open government theory and practice.

Based on this understanding, purely technical power of the data holder to exclude others from “her” data does not mean that she has a superior or even exclusive right to generate value from the data. By means of legal mechanisms, the competent legislator or public authorities may therefore counteract such purely de facto powers of data holders by opening their technical access control over data for other parties and define the conditions of its use. In doing so, the interests of the data holder in keeping the data for themselves must be weighed up against the interests of data users in using the data as well as the interests in controlling the related risks of all parties affected by this use. While this balancing exercise may be established, in a more or less general manner, by the European or national legislator or even by municipalities, data intermediaries will have to play a central role in ensuring that this balancing of interest is resolved in specific cases. Data intermediaries may do this not only by specifying the general data usage rules provided by the legislators and municipalities in the form of context-specific access and use conditions but above all by monitoring compliance with these conditions.",2025-11-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,106214,,,59,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Data access rights; Data commons; Data governance; Data intermediary; Data ownership; Open data; Proprietary data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts. Our machine learning methodology can assist cities to better monitor building alteration activity, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of redevelopment, and more fully understand the economic, social, and environmental implications of changes to the urban built environment.",2019-11-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,101383,,,78,,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Big data; Building alteration; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Topic modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To promote the dispersion of information consumption, China constructed an information consumption demonstration city (ICDC) in 2015; however, the impact of ICDC policies on green city development remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore the impact of ICDC policies on city-level carbon dioxide and pollutant emissions. Based on panel data of 204 cities in China from 2010 to 2019, a quasi-experiment method was adopted to evaluate the effects of the ICDC policy on CO2 and SO2 emissions using a difference-in-differences model. The results indicated a significant effect of ICDC policies on green development, reducing urban CO2 and SO2 growth rates by 36% and 31%, respectively. This conclusion was validated using several robustness tests. The mechanism analysis revealed that ICDC policies increased government spending on science and technology, reduced passenger traffic volumes, and promoted the city's digital finance development but had a negative impact on innovative research and development.

However, several challenges to their adoption persist, especially in developing countries. In Algeria, the concept “smart buildings” remains relatively new. Therefore, building professionals often find themselves hampered by numerous challenges when attempting to adopt smart buildings. This paper aims to identify the key challenges to smart building adoption in Algeria, classifying them into technical, economic, regulatory, and social challenges. Additionally, it evaluates the significance of these challenges based on the insights of experienced industry professionals. To achieve the purpose of this research, an exploratory approach was conducted, consisting of two main components: first, identifying challenges through a comprehensive literature review, and second, ranking these challenges based on a quantitative questionnaire survey conducted with 89 Algerian building professionals. A subgroup analysis was also performed to examine variations in perceptions among respondents. The findings revealed 24 key challenges, with the most critical being the absence of conceptual guidelines or frameworks, infrastructure deficiencies, lack of an action plan, complexity of smart building systems, lack of skilled professionals, and high construction costs. Additionally, respondents’ experience and organization type significantly influenced their perceptions of these challenges. This study provides a systematic and localized understanding of the main challenges to smart buildings adoption in Algeria. Its findings can assist building professionals in addressing these challenges, ultimately supporting the wider implementation of smart buildings in the future. Finally, this research concludes that establishing clear guidelines, along with their concrete implementation, is essential. Additionally, proposed strategies include government financial incentives for stakeholders, professional training programs, public–private partnerships between the government and private companies, and strengthened collaborations between academic institutions and companies are crucial to overcoming these challenges.",2025-09-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,115893,,,342,,Energy and Buildings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Algeria; Barriers; Challenges; Developing countries; Smart buildings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, surprisingly little attention has focused on how CE discourses interact with science, technology, and innovation (ST&I) actors. To address this gap, this research adopts the prism of socio-technical imaginaries to understand specific visions of circularity in science and innovation, exploring how competing imaginaries mobilize specific actors, institutions, and visions of a greener future. Our empirical material included archival documentation from the Norwegian government and funded research projects on CE. Our analysis identified two key tension points within these imaginaries: “International drivers versus regional and local transition arenas” and “Ecological modernization versus sectoral transformation.” We suggest that tensions are inherent in CE socio-technical imaginaries but are often silenced or minimized by institutional discourses on circularity. Our findings suggest that official CE policy programs tend to minimize or overtly ignore criticisms and contestation that are increasingly raised in academic circles. Our findings indicate the need for increased involvement of ST&I actors and other societal actors (such as NGOs and the private sector) in the CE policymaking process to avoid endless growth as an unexpected CE policy outcome.",2022-10-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,121903,,,183,,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Circular economy; Discourse analysis; Environmental innovation; Environmental politics; Socio-technical imaginaries; Thematic analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few human activities fit this description better than politics. In politics we deal with some of the most complex issues humans face, short-term and long-term consequences have to be balanced, and we make decisions knowing that we do not fully understand their consequences. I examine an extreme case of the application of AI in the domain of government, and use this case to examine a subset of the potential harms associated with algorithmic governance. I focus on five objections based on political theoretical considerations and the potential political harms of an AI technocracy. These are objections based on the ideas of ‘political man’ and participation as a prerequisite for legitimacy, the non-morality of machines and the value of transparency and accountability. I conclude that these objections do not successfully derail AI technocracy, if we make sure that mechanisms for control and backup are in place, and if we design a system in which humans have control over the direction and fundamental goals of society. Such a technocracy, if the AI capabilities of policy formation here assumed becomes reality, may, in theory, provide us with better means of participation, legitimacy, and more efficient government.",2020-08-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,101283,,,62,,Technology in Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artificial intelligence; Democracy; Legitimacy; Participation; Technocracy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We argue that digital technologies—including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), automation, sensors and biosensors, blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT)—can enhance the bioeconomy measurement. However, there is currently no clear evidence linking the elements of the cyber-physical social system (CPSS) within the conceptual scopes of the bioeconomy. So, this study explores the convergence between digital technologies and the conceptual elements of bioeconomy. Firstly, independent literature reviews were conducted using Biblioshiny, VOSviewer, QDA Miner and WordStat to (i) define the core terms in the scope of bioeconomy concepts and (ii) map the digital technologies. Secondly, we coded and analyzed the literature content with QDA Miner and WordStat to examine the co-occurrence of digital technologies and the conceptual elements of the bioeconomy. The results indicate that the Biomass-Based Bioeconomy (BmBB), Biotechnology-Based Bioeconomy (BtBB), and Biosphere-Based Bioeconomy (BsBB) possess distinct clusters of conceptual elements but also integrative domains, like metabolism. Our findings reveal that digital technologies within categories of data science and analytics, computing and software, and imaging and sensing have been the most prevalent in the bioeconomy context. Evidence has surfaced regarding the interactions between the bioeconomy concepts and digital technologies, illustrating the role of digitization in enhancing data collection, storage, processing and communication across various aspects of the bioeconomy. This evidence underscores the potential of digitalization for a comprehensive measure of the bioeconomy. Ultimately, this research provides valuable insights for improving bioeconomy assessment and supports sustainability goals by integrating emerging digital technologies with the bioeconomy development.",2026-03-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,103101,,,84,,Technology in Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artificial intelligence; Cyber-technologies; Digital technologies; Society 5.0; Sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relevance of data in ED is even more crucial in a business context in which Data Science (DS) is literally revolutionizing the way companies operate and therefore also the way data are analyzed. Despite having been recognized as crucial for ED processes, data still remain closed in the domain and accessible only to their owners due to several constraints related to the private and proprietary nature of the acquired data. An answer to these challenges could be found in Open Data, but at the state of the art an operational Engineering Design framework to embrace them is still far to be achieved by both academia and industry.

Wearable monitors and artificial intelligence–based decision support systems could be integrated with hospital-based digital health systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) to provide higher level care at a relatively low cost. However, the appropriate and sustainable application of these innovations in low- and middle-income countries requires an understanding of the local government’s requirements and regulations such as technology specifications, cybersecurity, data-sharing protocols, and interoperability. Objective This scoping review aims to explore the current state of digital health research and the policies that govern the adoption of digital health systems in Vietnamese hospitals. Methods We conducted a scoping review using a modification of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for academic publications, and Thư Viện Pháp Luật, a proprietary database of Vietnamese government documents, and the Vietnam Electronic Health Administration website were searched for government documents. Google Scholar and Google Search were used for snowballing searches. The sources were assessed against predefined eligibility criteria through title, abstract, and full-text screening. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The review process was primarily undertaken by one researcher and reviewed by another researcher during each step. Results In total, 11 academic publications and 20 government documents were included in this review. Among the academic studies, 5 reported engineering solutions for information systems in hospitals, 2 assessed readiness for EHR implementation, 1 tested physicians’ performance before and after using clinical decision support software, 1 reported a national laboratory information management system, and 2 reviewed the health system’s capability to implement eHealth and artificial intelligence. Of the 20 government documents, 19 were promulgated from 2013 to 2020. These regulations and guidance cover a wide range of digital health domains, including hospital information management systems, general and interoperability standards, cybersecurity in health organizations, conditions for the provision of health information technology (HIT), electronic health insurance claims, laboratory information systems, HIT maturity, digital health strategies, electronic medical records, EHRs, and eHealth architectural frameworks. Conclusions Research about hospital-based digital health systems in Vietnam is very limited, particularly implementation studies. Government regulations and guidance for HIT in health care organizations have been released with increasing frequency since 2013, targeting a variety of information systems such as electronic medical records, EHRs, and laboratory information systems. In general, these policies were focused on the basic specifications and standards that digital health systems need to meet. More research is needed in the future to guide the implementation of digital health care systems in the Vietnam hospital setting.",2022-02-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,,,2,24,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,administrative information; compulsory; data; digital health; eHealth; electronic medical records; health; health insurance ID; hospital care; mobile phone; patient ID; policy; standards; Vietnam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To deal with the enormous volumes of trade customs administrations rely more and more on information technology (IT) and risk assessment, and are starting to explore the possibilities that data analytics (DA) can offer to support their supervision tasks. Driven by customs as our empirical domain, we explore the use of DA to support the supervision role of government. Although data analytics is considered to be a technological breakthrough, there is so far only a limited understanding of how governments can translate this potential into actual value and what are barriers and trade-offs that need to be overcome to lead to value realisation. The main question that we explore in this paper is: How to identify the value of DA in a government supervision context, and what are barriers and trade-offs to be considered and overcome in order to realise this value? Building on leading models from the information system (IS) literature, and by using case studies from the customs domain, we developed the Value of Data Analytics in Government Supervision (VDAGS) framework. The framework can help managers and policy-makers to gain a better understanding of the benefits and trade-offs of using DA when developing DA strategies or when embarking on new DA projects.

Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.",2019-06-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,288-307,,,102,,Automation in Construction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Blockchain technologies; Built environment; Construction industry; Distributed ledger technology (DLT); Project Bank Accounts (PBAs); Regulations and compliance; Socio-technical systems; Use cases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of the scholarly and regulatory discourse remains entrenched in abstract legal principles or normative frameworks, leaving the empirical landscape uncharted or minimally engaged. Since the birth of EU data protection law, a modest body of empirical evidence has been generated but remains widely scattered and unexamined. Such evidence offers vital insights into the effectiveness of data protection measures but languishes on the periphery, inadequately integrated into the broader conversation. To make a meaningful connection, we conduct a comprehensive review and synthesis of empirical research spanning nearly three decades (1995 - March 2022), advocating for a more robust integration of empirical evidence into the evaluation and review of the GDPR while laying a methodological foundation for coordinated research. By categorising evidence into four distinct groups– Awareness and Trust, Operational Performance, Ripple Effect, and Normative Clarity, we provide a structured analysis therein and highlight the variety and nuances of the empirical evidence produced about the GDPR. Our discussion offers critical reflections on the current orientations and designs of evaluation work, challenging some popular but misguided orientations that significantly influence public debate and even direction of empirical and doctrinal research. This synthesis also sheds light on several understated aspects, surfaced by our systematic review, including the complex structure of the GDPR and the internal contradictions between components, the GDPR's interaction with other normative values and legal frameworks, as well as unintended consequences imposed by the GDPR on other values not explicitly recognised as regulatory objectives (such as innovation). We further propose a methodological improvement in how empirical evidence can be generated and utilised, stressing the need for more guided, coordinated and rigorous empirical research. By re-aligning empirical focus towards these ends and establishing strategic coordination at the community level, we seek to inform and underpin evaluative work that aligns empirical inquiries with policy and doctrinal needs, while truly reflecting the complexities and challenges of safeguarding personal data in the digital age.",2025-07-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,106129,,,57,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Data protection; Digital regulation; Empirical evidence; GDPR; Systematic review; Tech giants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we question the transformative credentials of smartness and argue that it is better understood as a partial fix for the economic, environmental and social challenges faced by cities. Drawing on the urban sustainability and smart city literatures, we develop the concept of the urban smart-sustainability fix. This concept focuses on how smart-sustainable city initiatives selectively integrate digital and environmental agendas via entrepreneurial forms of urban governance. We develop this concept by examining how the urban smart-sustainability fix is constructed in the European Commission’s flagship smart cities and communities lighthouse projects, focusing on the Triangulum initiative. Our research reveals three elements of the urban smart-sustainability fix: (1) the spatial development of smart-sustainable districts; (2) the digitisation of urban infrastructure to reveal hidden processes; and, (3) collaborative experimentation with low-carbon and digital technologies. We argue that this has produced urban districts that are attempting to reduce their carbon emissions while promoting green economic growth. The main aim of the urban smart-sustainability fix is to make the urban realm more manageable resulting in amplification, rather than transformation, of the dominant ecological modernisation agenda of sustainable development.",2019-02-01,2025-10-16 11:50:58,2025-10-16 11:50:58,,640-648,,,45,,Sustainable Cities and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ecological modernisation agenda; Smart city; Smart-sustainability fix; Urban sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study assesses the factors that lead to the intention to continue to use these platforms, with the objective of establishing a revised approach to better governance through these platform-based services. A conceptual framework is proposed, based on an integration of various models, and tested using primary data from citizens subscribing to platform-based government services. The results indicate that a continuous availability of such services has better predictive power for the continual-use intention. A unique contribution of the study worth highlighting is the significance of the factor, “sovereign structural assurance,” a pre-requisite for strengthening the degree of control.

However, several spectacular AI failures have led to ethical concerns about responsibility in AI development and use, which gave rise to the emerging field of responsible AI (RAI). The field of responsible innovation (RI) has a longer history and evolved toward a framework for the entire research, development, and innovation life cycle. However, this research demonstrates that the uptake of RI by RAI has been slow. RAI has been developing independently, with three times the number of publications than RI. The objective and knowledge contribution of this research was to understand how RAI has been developing independently from RI and contribute to how RI could be leveraged toward the progression of RAI in a causal loop diagram. It is concluded that stakeholder engagement of citizens from diverse cultures across the Global North and South is a policy leverage point for moving the RI adoption by RAI toward global best practice. A role-specific recommendation for policy makers is made to deploy modes of engaging with the Global South with more urgency to avoid the risk of harming vulnerable populations. As an additional methodological contribution, this study employs a novel method, systematic science mapping, which combines systematic literature reviews with science mapping. This new method enabled the discovery of an emerging ‘axis of adoption’ of RI by RAI around the thematic areas of ethics, governance, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability. 828 Scopus articles were mapped for RI and 2489 articles were mapped for RAI.

The author posits that open government data (OGD) has a significant role to play in facilitating the economic turnaround of the GCC region, given that OGD promotes innovation and economic growth besides providing avenues for collaboration and participation among different stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach Following a structured literature review, the paper scans literature on OGD followed by providing a typology of countries on the basis of their OGD-adherence (“laggard”, “caged”, “forerunner” and “champ”). This is followed by a discussion on the ongoing oil prices’ crisis, and evidentiary support is lent by examples from the OGD portals of each of the six GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) to provide indicators as to how a robust OGD implementation may support their economic diversification objectives. Findings Although the present OGD framework of the GCC is relatively weak, it is asserted that OGD has immense potential in facilitating the economic diversification initiatives of the GCC countries.

The research classifies existing literature into three main discussion topics – predictive justice, human–machine combination and robot judges – through a multidisciplinary approach that includes technological, ethical and legal perspectives. By exploring AI’s transformative role, this study highlights the innovative integration of technology in legal decision-making and policy development. Design/methodology/approach The research follows the PRISMA methodology to systematically review 140 relevant papers from the Scopus database. It combines qualitative and quantitative analyses, including bibliometric mapping, visualization techniques and bibliographic coupling. A theory-building approach is adopted to identify key trends, challenges and opportunities in AI-driven innovation, emphasizing its impact on modern judicial systems. Findings The review highlights the increasing innovation in legal processes through AI applications, offering enhanced efficiency and predictive capabilities while raising ethical concerns regarding bias, transparency and human oversight. The findings categorize AI-based innovations in justice into three key areas: (1) predictive justice, where AI tools analyse jurisprudential data to support legal decision-making; (2) human–machine collaboration, where AI enhances legal professionals’ efficiency in case management and legal research and (3) the concept of robot judges, which explores the potential and limitations of fully automated legal decisions. The study also emphasizes the transition from Justice 4.0 to Justice 5.0, promoting human-centred AI innovation in judicial systems. Research limitations/implications While this study comprehensively maps AI-driven innovations in justice, the rapid evolution of AI technologies may introduce new developments beyond the scope of this review. Future research should focus on empirical studies to assess the real-world effectiveness and fairness of AI-driven legal innovation. Practical implications The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, legal practitioners and AI developers, guiding the responsible implementation of AI innovations in justice systems. Understanding the interplay between technological innovation and law is crucial for ensuring transparent and equitable legal decision-making. Social implications The integration of AI-based innovations in justice potentially improves legal accessibility and efficiency while also posing risks related to algorithmic bias and the erosion of human judicial discretion. Addressing these concerns is vital for fostering trust in AI-assisted legal frameworks.

A lack of government support has exacerbated the disruption to supply chains in some regions of the world. The positive influence of digitalization on social inclusion, government accountability, and creating a more open environment is well understood. Despite this, different countries have shown varying degrees of digital responsiveness during the pandemic as they attempted to deal with the effects of various COVID strains. The influence of government policies on the supply chain has not been examined in the literature so far and, hence, to address this research gap, we examine the interaction effect of government support effectiveness i.e., tax credits, interest deferral, digital investment, soft loans on dynamic capabilities i.e., digital adaptabilities and digital agilities and on supply chain resilience, using a multi-method approach. To understand how digital adaptability and agility improve supply chain resilience, we conducted 13 semi-structured interviews. Additionally, we pretested our measurement instrument using qualitative semi-structured interviews to validate our hypothesized relationships. We collected data at a specific point of time using a survey-based instrument (N = 203) to address our research questions. Based on data analyses of both the qualitative and survey-based data, our findings indicate that digital adaptability is an important driver of digital agility. Furthermore, the results indicate that government effectiveness is crucial to enhancing supply chain resilience by enhancing digital adaptability and agility. Our research makes some useful contributions to the dynamic capability view by enhancing theoretical understanding, of the role of government in building digital capabilities in uncertain times, to improve supply chain resilience.

However, few studies have sought to understand what motivates people to use community wireless networks and the unintended effects that those technologies have on communities, particularly for rural users. The purpose of this paper is to explore the benefits and usage of an asynchronous wireless internet system in a rural village of Cambodia to examine the issues and challenges in the acceptance of a new technology in a less-developed country. Design/methodology/approach By employing qualitative methods of in-depth case analysis, the authors revealed various usage motivations and unintended effects of the system. Findings The authors identified five reasons that motivated users to use the system: avowed identity, a means to an end, maintaining personal ties, power and influence, and psychological commitment and ownership. The unintended effects of the system included increased number of interactions among actors and other uses of the system, including internet commerce, telemedicine, and e-government. Research limitations/implications This study explores the wireless internet project known as the “Internet Village Motoman Project” that was initiated by a non-governmental organization with funding from private donors, supplemented with matching funds from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. Originality/value This study contributes to the academic understanding of rural regions of Cambodia and its evidence supports the current theoretical assumptions that user behaviors are not determined only by users’ decisions alone (as proposed by traditional cognitive IS research), but also by users and their social interactions as stated in the four-dimensional social actor framework proposed by Lamb and Kling (2003). The latter provides better explanation of the motivation for internet use in the region.

To address this gap, this paper provides an illustrative case involving the development and testing of models used to predict the probability of whether U.S. foster children would achieve legal permanency. The models were trained and tested using a national administrative dataset of 233,633 foster care children that discharged from state child welfare systems in 2013.

An extensive content analysis of the SE is conducted in this paper, with 1787 scholarly articles from 2010 to 2024 reviewed. The study outlines the considerable growth and transformative potential of the SE, influenced by digital developments and societal shifts towards more sustainable, inclusive, and technology-integrated practices. The expanding body of SE literature is categorized, and a total of 13 categories are identified including: “consumer dynamics in the SE”, “cultural and community dynamics in the SE”, “service quality and user experience in the SE”, “sustainability dimension of the SE”, “emerging technologies in the SE”, “ethical, security, and safety aspects of the SE”, “market dynamics and competitive landscapes in the SE”, “social and economic implications of the SE”, “urban development and SE”, “legal, regulatory, and governance frameworks in the SE”, “business innovation and models in the SE”, “industry-specific impact of SE”, and “research directions in the SE”. The SE's evolution from its emerging stages to its current focus on sustainability, technological innovations, and future directions is outlined through the temporal analysis. The study highlights how the SE transforms consumer behavior and traditional business models, while also emphasizing the critical role of technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain in enhancing economic efficiency, social equity, and environmental sustainability. Additionally, the analysis presents a significant focus on emerging technologies, highlighting their potential to transform sectors within the SE and support the development of smart, sustainable urban development.

Therefore, health care staff are often provided with a wide range of access such as a “breaking-the-glass” or “self-authorization” mechanism for emergency access. However, this broad access can undermine the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive health care data because breaking-the-glass can lead to vast unauthorized access, which could be problematic when determining illegitimate access in security practices. Objective A review was performed to pinpoint appropriate artificial intelligence (AI) methods and data sources that can be used for effective modeling and analysis of health care staff security practices. Based on knowledge obtained from the review, a framework was developed and implemented with simulated data to provide a comprehensive approach toward effective modeling and analyzing security practices of health care staff in real access logs. Methods The flow of our approach was a mapping review to provide AI methods, data sources and their attributes, along with other categories as input for framework development. To assess implementation of the framework, electronic health record (EHR) log data were simulated and analyzed, and the performance of various approaches in the framework was compared. Results Among the total 130 articles initially identified, 18 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thorough assessment and analysis of the included articles revealed that K-nearest neighbor, Bayesian network, and decision tree (C4.5) algorithms were predominantly applied to EHR and network logs with varying input features of health care staff security practices. Based on the review results, a framework was developed and implemented with simulated logs. The decision tree obtained the best precision of 0.655, whereas the best recall was achieved by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm at 0.977. However, the best F1-score was obtained by random forest at 0.775. In brief, three classifiers (random forest, decision tree, and SVM) in the two-class approach achieved the best precision of 0.998. Conclusions The security practices of health care staff can be effectively analyzed using a two-class approach to detect malicious and nonmalicious security practices. Based on our comparative study, the algorithms that can effectively be used in related studies include random forest, decision tree, and SVM. Deviations of security practices from required health care staff’s security behavior in the big data context can be analyzed with real access logs to define appropriate incentives for improving conscious care security practice.",2021-12-01,2025-10-16 11:50:59,2025-10-16 11:50:59,,,,12,9,,JMIR Medical Informatics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,analysis; artificial intelligence; framework; health care; machine learning; modeling; security; security practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, a systematic literature review and scientometric analysis is conducted showing refinements in RDF application for energy-from-waste (EfW) initiatives, forging a comprehensive approach to sustainable waste management. Key aspects of EfW projects using RDF are examined, focusing on methodologies for calorific value estimation, waste characterization, quality assessment, and public–private partnerships (PPPs). Emphasis is placed on the necessity of accurate energy potential measurement and advanced characterization techniques, including computer vision, for effective waste sorting and analysis. Quality assessments of RDF are highlighted for their impact on decisions within the biomass fuel supply chain, emphasizing the importance of optimizing energy recovery. PPP’s are identified as key to successful execution of EfW projects, with their roles, trends, and risk modeling crucial for fostering effective collaboration between public and private sectors. The study concludes by identifying research gaps, such as the deficiency of new frameworks to support technical assessments of waste processing facilities for strategic, tactical, and operational improvements. Additionally, RDF applications in EfW are limited because of inconsistent waste sorting, deviation from specifications and environmental regulations.

However, accurately defining and measuring its impact on national economies remains a complex endeavor. This paper explores the definition, measurement, role, and impacts of the digital economy across various economies. It also examines the involvement of governments and telecommunication regulators in assessing the digital economy and identifies future directions for developing countries. A systematic literature review utilizing the PRISMA Model is employed to investigate the factors and indices used to measure the digital economy. The findings highlight ongoing efforts to harmonize the definition and metrics; nonetheless, challenges persist due to the scarcity of appropriate datasets and variations in country-specific definitions. Additionally, the effectiveness of existing digital economy indices and toolkits in assessing the level of digitalization in developing countries is evaluated. The paper concludes that despite ongoing efforts to bridge the gaps, the concept of the digital economy remains defined and measured differently, necessitating a new definition that accounts for various contextual peculiarities. Furthermore, a roadmap is proposed to develop a toolkit that ensures comprehensive measurement, thus preventing an underestimation of the digital economy's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in developing countries. The paper underscores the need for international and multi-stakeholder dialogue to establish a common understanding of the digital economy's definition and measurement. Developing countries, such as Nigeria, are urged to develop or adopt new metrics tailored to their unique circumstances, facilitating an accurate and efficient quantification of the digital economy's impact on crucial indicators like GDP. Improved statistical data collection and recording methodologies are recommended for both governments and the private sector.

Scholars and policymakers argue that the private sector could be more efficient than the public authorities in implementing adaptation measures and argue for the need to engage citizens to ensure legitimacy of adaptation and inclusion of locally relevant knowledge. To what extent do cities address the private sector and citizens in their adaptation initiatives? What modes of governance do they use to do this? What kinds of cities are the most likely to address the private sector and citizens? Going beyond the existing case study approaches, this paper answers these questions using a large N data set covering 402 cities around the world. We find that a majority of adaptation initiatives focus exclusively on the public sector and do not address the private sector or citizens. In the cases where they do, the private sector is more often governed through partnerships and participation, whereas citizen participation is relatively rare. Initiatives involving citizens rely more often on a provision of information that encourages citizens to adapt. We find that the more advanced a city is in its adaptation process, the more likely it is to address the private sector than citizens in its initiatives to adapt to climate change. Whereas with partnerships and participation the private sector can influence urban adaptation arrangements at a broader scale, the provision of information allows citizens only to implement individual adaptation measures according to their capacities.",2018-11-01,2025-10-16 11:51:07,2025-10-16 11:51:07,,127-136,,,53,,Global Environmental Change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cities; Citizens; Climate change adaptation; Governance; Private sector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings show how experts simultaneously recognise Strava Metro data as: (a) statistically valid and representative of observable cycling activities, including correlation with complementary cycle counter data. And as (b) demographically biased and unrepresentative of society, as Strava Metro data samples disproportionally capture journeys made by younger male cyclists. All expert interviewees emphasised the importance of considering a variety of data sources to support transport planning decisions, and emphasised Strava Metro data sample biases and limitations. However, our analysis of transport professional’s perceptions reveals how cycling app data, such as Strava Metro, has implications for social justice.

As existing literature mostly studied innovative city-regions of the Global North, there is an urgent need to examine the emerging latecomers, particularly those from the transitional economies. In this paper, Cluj-Napoca, Romania has been used a case to study the rising innovative city-regions in the transitional economies, their role in the global innovation networks, and the development of domestic innovation capability. The paper's specific objectives are to evaluate the current status of its regional innovation cluster in the global network, its structural strength and weakness, and the effectiveness of institutional management. A multi-case analysis approach has been used to analyze domestic companies and multinational corporations that are key actors in local innovation system. In addition to the secondary data, 23 interviews were conducted with local business, university researchers, and government officials. The main findings are: first, while Romania as an economy is still categorized as a factor-driven economy, sectors of some city-regions in the country, such as the ICT sector, has started to move towards the innovation-driven economy closely articulated in the global innovation network, especially in Europe's innovation network of software development. Second, while the region can be characterized as to have the relatively strong global pipelines, i.e., linkages with outside players, it has weak local buzz, i.e., local networks. Third, multinational corporations that have generally been attracted to the region due to the overseas-returnee community who are interested in linking Cluj-Napoca to the global innovation network. Local companies have equally benefited from the returning IT talents. One particular challenge is that although start-ups were emerging in Cluj-Napoca, the city-region was not effective at retaining these start-ups by providing opportunities for their further growth. Fourth, like any other city-region, Cluj-Napoca has been under the institutional influence at multiple levels, from the European Union (EU), the national government, the regional government, the county government, to the municipal government. However, close university-industry connection remains a challenge. It is recommended that the city-region should consider a variety of approaches to enhance the local buzz, specifically the social networks and innovation milieu of the city-region. Moreover, it needs to provide more resources for start-ups and do a better job in the retention of the start-ups.",2019-08-01,2025-10-16 11:51:08,2025-10-16 11:51:08,,101139,,,58,,Technology in Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Catching up; City-region; ICT; Innovation; Latecomer; Transitional economy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our focus is on Canada, and the apparent need for further intra-rural broadband research and better data and mapping for informing public investment decisions, but similar challenges are evident in the international literature. Based on proprietary telecommunication provider datasets, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunication Commission (CRTC) estimates that broadband services with advertised speeds that meet its basic universal service targets (50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload) are available to 87.4 percent of households in Canada. In rural areas however, services that meet CRTC’s speed targets are available to 45.6 percent of households. Moreover, effective speeds and service quality levels that suppliers deliver and users experience tend to fall well below the government’s aspirational targets. In response to demand for better broadband, a variety of initiatives are directing public investment to the deployment of regional and rural broadband networks, which are typically owned and operated by private companies. There remains a serious lack of relevant data and its effective use in creating rural broadband strategies and managing public investment projects. Evidence from the literature suggest that this affects the degree and quality of geo-spatial and econometric analysis that results in a limited empirical basis to allocate scarce public investments, aggregate demand of consumers/communities, and assess the outcomes of rural broadband initiatives ex post. This paper provides a historical overview of rural broadband development in Canada and questions if the body of knowledge to inform public investment initiatives has grown sufficiently to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability.

In this context, active mobility - such as walking and cycling - has emerged as a key strategy to promote more sustainable, inclusive, and efficient urban environments. However, despite growing interest, significant gaps remain in the research agenda for active mobility in LAC. This paper identifies research priorities for advancing active mobility in the region, based on discussions from a workshop organized by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) during the XXII Pan-American Congress of Transportation and Logistics (PANAM 2023) in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The results highlight the need for further research on the social, economic, and environmental impacts of active mobility, including its relationship with health, safety, and transport equity. Additionally, opportunities for integrating active mobility with public transport and applying advanced data analytics to understand travel behavior were identified as key areas for exploration. By addressing these research gaps, this agenda aims to strengthen evidence-based policymaking and enhance the role of active mobility in sustainable urban development across LAC. Advancing this knowledge will not only contribute to reducing emissions and improving health outcomes but also support a transition toward more equitable and efficient transport systems in the region.",2025-12-01,2025-10-16 11:51:08,2025-10-16 11:51:08,,100040,,,3,,Latin American Transport Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active mobility; Latin America; Non-motorized transport; Public transport integration; Sustainable urban development; Transport equity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these owners, these waves of transformation require constant adaptation as they compete with existing initiatives and embedded legacy practices. This paper presents the results of the second part of a longitudinal research project aimed at framing digital transformation within municipalities to improve urban infrastructure lifecycles. More specifically, the paper presents the results of work undertaken to operationalize, extend and further validate the digital transformation framework that has been developed in part 1 and which is presented elsewhere. The theoretical framework acts as a guide and analysis tool for the digital transformation of municipalities and aims to help them reduce and/or eliminate the barriers and challenges in this digital transformation. To do so, the results from a survey conducted within 44 municipalities and interviews conducted with 13 municipalities of different sizes are presented and discussed through the theoretical framework. The results show that data and information management remain the key issues, especially in a siloed organizational context such as those found within municipalities. Moreover, a significant amount of organizations remain unaware of how to approach digital transformation which in turn leads to disinterest or disengagement in digital transformation, which results in localized or fragmented initiatives. This in turn can cause delays in implementing transformational initiatives and contributes to maintaining a low level of digital maturity.

This study investigates how MPOs are currently planning for emerging technologies by analyzing regional transportation plans (RTPs) of the 50 largest MPOs and interviewing planning staff from 17 MPOs. We examine the extent to which anticipatory governance and responsible innovation, which come from science and technology studies (STS), are integrated into MPO planning efforts, shedding light on trends in transportation planning theory and practice. Findings reveal limited integration of anticipatory governance and responsible innovation into their planning processes. Some include aspects of foresight and engagement, but reflexivity, flexibility, and responsiveness are much less developed. Key actions being taken include more comprehensive thinking about region-specific impacts of technologies, developing policies, piloting technologies, building partnerships, and creating new tools and planning models. The extent to which these practices are creating adaptive capacities within MPOs is still limited. To address this, we propose an adaptive transportation planning model that combines anticipatory governance and responsible innovation with long-range transport planning.

Therefore, BT holds considerable promise for the industrial and service sectors; however, its implementation during the procurement stage in a sustainable construction project (SCP) is a bottleneck because of inherent and unknown barriers. Though some attempts on the identification of these barriers have been carried out, the literature lacks a thorough investigation into the relationships and inner dependencies among the related barriers within the realm of SCP. Thus, a novel combination of fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (fuzzy DEMATEL) and social network analysis (FDSNA) is proposed in this paper to fill this gap; FDSNA uncovers causal relationships among leading barriers that impede the adoption of BT within an SCP, and it determines the most critical barriers by modeling their complex interrelationships in related intricate environments. The obtained results suggest “inadequacies in implementing block chain-based policies” and “unawareness and resistance to BT among customers” as the most significant barriers, and “technology immaturity,” “market uncertainty and competition,” and “technology accessibility” are identified as the most critical. These results present managers and governmental bodies with an inclusive picture regarding the major obstructions to the successful implementation of BT, and it is expected to open avenues to accrue benefits from such leading-edge technologies at a greater pace.",2023-06-01,2025-10-16 11:51:08,2025-10-16 11:51:08,,136840,,,403,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Blockchain technology; Fuzzy DEMATEL; Social network analysis; Sustainability; Sustainable construction projects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the triggers is China's rise in 5G standardization and its lead in the telecommunications equipment market, which causes security concerns. In response, the U.S. promotes Open RAN as an alternative to the Chinese providers' proprietary solutions. It is claimed to enable the establishment and operation of open and safer networks for 5G and beyond. This paper examines why and how the U.S. promotes Open RAN and what the responses are from other countries. We find that the U.S. government's strong support for the development and dissemination of Open RAN signals its techno-nationalistic turn in international standardization. The origin of Open RAN is geopolitical in the sense that it represents a reaction to China's lead in 5G standardization. The geopolitical perspective is strengthened as we find the formation of alliances in support of Open RAN. A refreshed approach of the U.S. to standardization has introduced a new dynamic to cooperation and competition for setting the global rules on next-generation mobile communication technologies as well as emerging technologies.

This research systematically examines the historical causes of anti-globalization and deglobalization through a comprehensive and critical review of relevant literature. Our findings indicate that anti-globalization initially spread among developing countries before appearing in developed countries, while the trend towards deglobalization has consistently intensified. We introduce the ‘EDGES’ framework, which encompasses Economic Systems, Digital Disruptions, Geopolitical Fracture, Environmental Sustainability, and Socio-Cultural Ideology. This framework captures the crucial challenges that MNEs currently face and will face prospectively, assisting in the establishment of a dynamic strategic response mechanism (i.e., from passive compliance for minimizing risks, defensive adaptation for maintaining competitive positioning, to an integrated approach for reshaping the global landscape).

Student debt and the challenges of increasingly diverse learners are two factors that determine college degree attainment. Paired with increasing consumerist interests by students, institutions, and governments for job preparedness and gainful employment, a college degree is viewed by many as a credential. By contrast, alternative credential programs offer design study that is shorter, more flexible, less expensive, and fit-to-purpose rather than one-size-fits-all. As credentials, they vary in standards for competency validation and how employers perceive them. Statistics show that most alternative credential students already hold a degree and are employed, suggesting that reskilling and upskilling are among the primary motivations for enrollment. At the same time, national and state governments show interest in micro-credentialling as the number of non-traditional learners grows and the nature of work changes rapidly.

Therefore, it is hard to use qualitative methods to systematically analyze the characteristics of complex policy networks. So the authors propose a bibliometric research study for exploring policy evolution from time–agency–theme perspectives to excavate the rules and existing problems of China's medical informatization policy and to provide suggestions for formulating and improving the future medical informatization policies. Design/methodology/approach Initially, 615 valid samples are obtained by retrieving related China's medical informatization policy documents, and the joint policy-making agency network and the co-occurrence network models of medical informatization policies are defined, and then the authors research China's medical informatization policies from single-dimension and multi-dimension view. Findings The analysis results reveal that China's medical informatization policy process can be divided into four stages; the policy-making agencies are divided into four subgroups by community detection analysis according to the fast unfolding algorithm; the core policy theme keywords are identified based on the eigenvector centrality of the nodes in those networks; the focuses of theme terms are varied in different stages and the correlations between agencies and themes are gradually decentralized. Practical implications These findings provide experience and evidence on leveraging informatics in the medical and healthcare field of China. Also, they can help scholars and practitioners better understand the current status and future directions of medical and healthcare informatics development in China and provide a reference to formulate and improve China's future medical informatization policies.

This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems; implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices; ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems; bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing; and electronic mass communications media.

More specifically, we examine whether the presentation format of a given popular report has different value to users. Our analysis is based on earlier works performed in relation to reporting formats in the private sector. For this purpose, we develop a concise popular report for a hypothetical municipality under three different formats (traditional PDF, flipping book and website) and we set up a questionnaire to evaluate an array of aspects namely completeness of information, clarity of information, visual appearance, navigation, usability, overall satisfaction and municipality image in each one of them. The questionnaire was answered by a sample of 165 respondents.

A key priority is establishing clear quality distinctions between the public and private sectors. No studies have directly compared the quality of DTC telemedicine in the public and private sectors using objective evaluation methods. Objective Using a standardized patient (SP) approach, this study aimed to compare the quality of DTC telemedicine provided by China’s public and private sectors. Methods We recruited 10 SPs presenting fixed cases (urticaria and childhood diarrhea), with 594 interactions between them and physicians. The SPs evaluated various aspects of the quality of care, effectiveness, safety, patient-centeredness (PCC), efficiency, and timeliness using the Institute of Medicine (IOM) quality framework. Ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression models with fixed effects were used for continuous variables, while logistic regression models with fixed effects were used for categorical variables. Results Significant quality differences were observed between public and private DTC telemedicine. Physicians from private platforms were significantly more likely to adhere to clinical checklists (adjusted β 15.22, P<.001); provide an accurate diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.85, P<.001), an appropriate prescription (adjusted OR 3.87, P<.001), and lifestyle modification advice (adjusted OR 6.82, P<.001); ensure more PCC (adjusted β 3.34, P<.001); and spend more time with SPs (adjusted β 839.70, P<.001), with more responses (adjusted β 1.33, P=.001) and more words (adjusted β 50.93, P=.009). However, SPs on private platforms waited longer for the first response (adjusted β 505.87, P=.001) and each response (adjusted β 168.33, P=.04) and paid more for the average visit (adjusted β 40.03, P<.001). Conclusions There is significant quality inequality in different DTC telemedicine platforms. Private physicians might provide a higher quality of service regarding effectiveness and safety, PCC, and response times and words. However, private platforms have longer wait times for their first response, as well as higher costs. Refining online reviews, establishing standardized norms and pricing, enhancing the performance evaluation mechanism for public DTC telemedicine, and imposing stricter limitations on the first response time for private physicians should be considered practical approaches to optimizing the management of DTC telemedicine.",2024-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:08,2025-10-16 11:51:08,,,,,26,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,China; direct-to-consumer telemedicine; effectiveness; management; objective evaluation; platform; private; public; quality of care; regression model; safety; standardized patient; telemedicine; timeliness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research on data governance in older persons’ health care is unexplored, providing little guidance for practice and future studies. Objective This scoping review aimed to synthesize available information on data governance in the context of older persons’ health based on evidence from literature. Methods The study followed the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley and PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). Online databases, namely, PubMed, Cochrane, Ovid, ACM, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar were searched by 2 independent reviewers (AG and AMB) for studies on older persons’ health data governance published from January 2000 to April 2024. The independent reviewers performed the search, screening, data extraction, and review of full-text papers. A third reviewer (YP) made the final decision for unresolved discrepancies between the first 2 reviewers. The framework by the World Health Organization Pan American Health Organization, a high-level framework for planning and implementing data governance in public health, was used in the data extraction and analysis. Descriptive statistics were used, and a descriptive approach was used to summarize the results of the scoping review. Results A total of 9840 titles were identified and 57 papers were included. Of these, 35 (61.4%) focused on technology, 19 (33.3%) on processes, and 3 (5.3%) on people.

Yet the role of these implications in ensuring academic research has wider economic and social impact is significantly under-researched. This article addresses this gap by developing a generalizable conceptual framework for examining the practical implications associated with academic research findings. A systematic literature review that focuses on digital marketing is used to assess the usefulness of this practical implications framework. Insights are provided into the dimensions that underpin how effectively these practical implications bridge the theory-practice divide and support economic and social impact. Multilevel archetypes of practical implications are developed to guide best practice in developing and reporting practical implications for researchers, journal reviewers, editors and publishers.",2025-02-01,2025-10-16 11:51:08,2025-10-16 11:51:08,,131-149,,,125,,Industrial Marketing Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,B2B digital marketing; Managerial implications; Practical implications; Relevance; Research impact; Societal value; Theory-practice divide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under this influence, varieties of government institutions worldwide have published a large number of datasets through open data portals. Government data covers diverse subjects and the scale of available data is growing every year. Published data is expected to be both accessible and discoverable. For these purposes, portals take advantage of metadata accompanying datasets. However, a part of metadata is often missing which decreases users’ ability to obtain the desired information. As the scale of published datasets grows, this problem increases. An approach we describe in this paper is focused towards decreasing this problem by implementing knowledge structures and algorithms capable of proposing the best match for the category where an uncategorized dataset should belong to. By doing so, our aim is twofold: enrich datasets metadata by suggesting an appropriate category and increase its visibility and discoverability. Our approach relies on information regarding open datasets provided by users — dataset description contained within dataset tags. Since dataset tags express low consistency due to their origin, in this paper we will present a method of optimizing their usage through means of semantic similarity measures based on natural language processing mechanisms. Optimization is performed in terms of reducing the number of distinct tag values used for dataset description. Once optimized, dataset tags are used to reveal shared conceptualization originating from their usage by means of Formal Concept Analysis. We will demonstrate the advantage of our proposal by comparing concept lattices generated using Formal Concept Analysis before and after the optimization process and use generated structure as a knowledge base to categorize uncategorized open datasets. Finally, we will present a categorization mechanism based on the generated knowledge base that takes advantage of semantic similarity measures to propose a category suitable for an uncategorized dataset.",2021-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:08,2025-10-16 11:51:08,,100624,,,66,,Journal of Web Semantics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Categorization; Formal concept analysis; Natural language processing; Open data; Semantic similarity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This contribution addresses this knowledge gap using a combination of doctrinal and non-doctrinal analysis, feminist legal methods and intersectionality. Building on the state of the art about DPIA, I revisit its advantages and drawbacks through feminist lenses, concluding that DPIA cannot be considered a feminist tool as such.

This study aims to explore the population health role of AHCs in Australia and England, where AHCs represent novel organisational forms. Methods A multiple-case study design using qualitative methods was used to explore population health goals and activities in four discrete AHCs in both countries during 2017 and 2018. Data from 85 interviews with AHC leaders, clinicians and researchers, direct observation, and documentation were analysed within and across the cases. Results Comparison across cases produced four cross-case themes: health care rather than population health; incremental rather than major health system change; different conceptions of “translation” and “innovation”; and unclear pathways to impact. The ability of the AHCs to define and enact a population health role was hindered during the study period by gaps in knowledge mobilisation strategies at a health system and policy level, the biomedical orientation of government designation schemes for AHCs in Australia and England, and competing expectations of the sovereign partner organisations in AHCs against a backdrop of limited operational resources.

The nation’s energy transition aims to address the increasing energy demand while curbing carbon emissions to tackle climate change. According to the World Energy Outlook 2024, India’s energy demand was 1074 Mtoe in 2023 and is expected to rise to 1921 Mtoe by 2040. Key challenges in this shift include economic and social risks from job losses in the fossil fuel sector, heavy dependence on coal, inconsistent policies, and inadequate infrastructure for integrating renewable energy. Additionally, the transition faces technological hurdles, land acquisition issues, market barriers and water challenges. India with 18 % of the population and just 4% of the world’s water supply faces the challenges of being water stressed country. Water is very important for India’s energy sector especially in energy generation which the paper focusses upon. India possesses significant renewable energy potential, particularly in solar and wind power within its energy mix, bolstered by strong government policies, international agreements, and technological advancements. As of September 2024, India’s solar energy capacity reached 90.76 GW, while wind energy capacity stood at 47.36 GW, significantly advancing the country’s energy transition. India’s commitment to sustainability is demonstrated by initiatives like the National Action Plan on Climate Change and its target of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 as mentioned in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) set after the Paris Agreement. The paper focusses the problems that India is facing for its energy transition including but not limited to its dependency on fossil fuels, social barriers, economic constraints and technological challenges and the way it is addressing these challenges. The current status of India’s energy mix has been mentioned and the evolution of the energy policy has been analysed. India has some great policies on ground but the efforts should be made for the stronger implementation of these policies for the sustainable energy transition. Key findings show that while India has done well in deployment of renewable energy, societal barriers, economic limits, technological limits and the dependence on fossil fuels still plague India. India’s energy transition will play a pivotal role in shaping global energy policies. India’s experience shows that, for a low carbon future, strong policies, innovation and immediate action is the key, and that this experience can provide the lessons for global energy transitions to be low carbon, and yet fair and equitable.",2025-07-26,2025-10-16 11:51:08,2025-10-16 11:51:08,,,,,,,Water-Energy Nexus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Climate Action; Energy Mix; Energy Policy; Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); Sustainable Energy Transition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, while the Europeanization of curricular content was still in its infancy 25 years ago, PA programs now project European content in their curricula. Second, and more importantly, Europeanization of PA has emerged, not as a movement to creating identikit education in PA, but as a common understanding of the quality of a discipline that remains necessarily context bound by its national, local and international dimensions. Following accepted complementary perspectives on Europeanization, the article explains the development of sustainable European PA institutions and standards for PA teaching as the result of responses to EU incentives as well as of social learning within transnational networks of European PA scholars.

New information The architecture of EcoBank comprises core technologies of WebGIS, Application Programming Interface (API), responsive web and open-source software (OSS). Comprehensive ecological datasets from three different sources, including the National Institute of Ecology (NIE) in Korea, related national and international platforms and repositories, enter the three conceptual modules in EcoBank: data management, analysis and service. Diverse potential stakeholders of EcoBank can be classified into three groups: researchers, policy-makers and public users. EcoBank aims to expand its horizons through mutual communication amongst these stakeholders. We opened and launched the EcoBank service in December 2019 and have now begun to broaden its network by linking it to other data platforms and repositories over the globe to find possible solutions to ecological issues in Korea.",2021-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:08,2025-10-16 11:51:08,,,,,9,,Biodiversity Data Journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EcoBank; ecological database platform; responsive web; stakeholders; WebGIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This trend has led to the digitalisation of innovation and entrepreneurship from the modern business perspective. The present study primarily aims to study how digital innovations shape the landscape of digital entrepreneurship and thematic perspectives. Design/methodology/approach The present research applied a systematic literature review (SLR) method based on the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and 47 articles were selected as the final sample size related to digital innovation and digital entrepreneurship. Though the ultimate sample size is acceptable and signifies a small sample size of 40, the choice is still justifiable as it follows the rule of thumb. Hence, “the rule of thumb” empowers the study to meaningfully contribute to the arena using the SLR method, and 40 qualified papers are an adequate lowest threshold number. Findings This study found that there is little investigation performed from the perspective of digital innovation and digital entrepreneurship. Prior studies researched were centred on innovation and entrepreneurship. The United Kingdom was the leading country that performed research on this domain followed by other countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States of America.

All sectors of the economy have been affected by this technological advancement. However, little is known of how 4IR technologies are used in Africa. This paper aimed to investigate how 4IR technologies can be harnessed to support sustainable development in Africa. The objectives of the study were to: examine the infometric patterns of research production on 4IR technologies for sustainable development in Africa; explore the perception of 4IR technologies and their potential for sustainable development in Africa; investigate the extent to which 4IR technologies have been harnessed to support sustainable development in Africa; determine the factors influencing the use of 4IR technologies for sustainable development in Africa; and identify the strategies which can be used to harness 4IR technologies for sustainable development in Africa. Design/methodology/approach The study applied a mixed methods research approach. Quantitative data was collected through bibliometrics analysis while qualitative data was collected by use of systematic literature review. Data was collected from Google Scholar using Harzing's “Publish or Perish” software and analysed using Microsoft Excel, Notepad, VOSviewer and Atlas.ti and presented using tables, graphs and figures. Findings The study retrieved 914 research publications on 4IR and sustainable development in Africa. It emerged that production of research on the subject has increased gradually over the years. The findings reveal that Africa is aware of the potential of 4IR for sustainable development. In fact, it emerged that 4IR technologies are being used to support education, health services, tourism, e-commerce, records integrity and project management. Some of the factors that inhibit the use of 4IR for sustainable development Africa include lack of relevant policies, low skill levels in 4IR technologies, inadequate infrastructure and lack of stakeholder involvement.

Institutional theory highlights the pressures, both coercive and normative, arising from the digital economy and regulatory environments, whereas resource dependence theory elucidates the strategic approaches organizations adopt to acquire vital resources and minimize network dependencies. This innovative research investigates how an organization's orientation towards the digital economy affects its role within R&D networks, leveraging insights from both theoretical standpoints. By pinpointing technology transformation and legal environment as key moderators, this study assesses their moderating effects. The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing 141,118 patents spanning from 1995 to 2018, concentrating on R&D efforts within China's strategic emerging sectors. The outcomes show that an organization's digital economy orientation, shaped by institutional norms and resource interdependencies, positively influences its network centrality but negatively impacts its structural hole position. Additionally, technology transformation and the legal environment, as institutional mechanisms, negatively modulate the relationship between digital economy orientation and network centrality, but positively influence the structural hole relationship.

Because of COVID-19, the government scaled down its operations, limiting access to public services, including among migrants. Design/methodology/approach Because of COVID-19-related restrictions, a systematic review was conducted of the relevant academic literature as well as the information portals of relevant government departments, municipalities and research reports on migration and refugees in South Africa. A total of 320 peer-reviewed research articles were identified. These were filtered and 68 relevant articles were selected. Findings The study found that asylum seekers have limited access to public services via information communication technology-enabled mechanisms. Whilst the city government has embraced e-governance, it is still in its nascent stages. Research limitations/implications This study was limited to a desktop one because of COVID-19 restrictions and it focused exclusively on asylum seekers. Therefore, its findings can only be generalised to this category of people. Practical implications Future studies on this subject should gather data from all categories of migrants to gain in-depth perspectives. Social implications All spheres of governance in South Africa should recognise asylum seekers as a constituency that deserves access to public services. E-governance can facilitate easier access to these services, and policies need to be aligned with this reality.

In the current literature, there are a lot of machine learning methods used in various job and training recommendation systems to tackle scientific or real-life problems. However, only a few use the existing occupational classifications to classify job and training advertisements or enable cross-regional labor mobility. Additionally, the quality of public e-services regarding labour market services in each European country varies greatly. For example, even though Estonia is typically referred to as being at the forefront of public service digitization and automation, it has not implemented machine learning methods to match job offers or training with candidates. The matching process between vacancy and job seeker is currently carried out with outdated International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) codes, altered to the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund's needs. The ISCO code is assigned to each job vacancy by a company and job wish by a citizen manually. Such functionality is rigid and requires the users to define an accurate ISCO code. Even when the filled-in CV consists of detailed previous work experience and educational background, if the ISCO code is not accurate, the e-service will not help the citizen find a new job. Moreover, in today's public employment service portals, there is typically no option to insert specific skills that a citizen has to receive an increased number of accurate job or training recommendations. Consequently, despite many well-established frameworks dealing with competencies and occupations, citizen-centered public services supporting upskilling and finding a new job are inefficient. In this paper, we put forth a research roadmap for investigating how to enable a technical ecosystem using occupational classification frameworks so that citizens, both employed and unemployed, can receive proactive recommendations about upcoming training events and job vacancies. Such a system should be tailored to support citizen life events. For example, it could consider citizens’ previous work and educational background to help with retraining, upskilling, or changing one's career path. Therefore we have initiated a project in collaboration with the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund, the Estonian Qualifications Authority, other Estonian public organizations, and partner universities in Latvia and Finland. The research is planned as an action design research to design an artificial intelligence-enabled Virtual Competence Assistant (VCA) for the EU labour market.",2022-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:08,2025-10-16 11:51:08,,2404-2413,,,207,,Procedia Computer Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AI; Job Matching; Proactivity; Upskilling; Virtual Competence Assistant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach The study applies social network analysis (SNA) to web-based EAB data for 38 journals listed under operations management (OM) in the 2010 ABS Academic Journal Quality Guide. Findings The members of EABs of the 38 journals are divided into seven distinct communities which are mapped to the field’s knowledge structures and further aggregated into a core and periphery of the network. A burgeoning community of supply chain management academics forms the core along with those with more traditional interests. Male academics affiliated to the US institutions and to business schools predominate in the sample. Research limitations/implications A new strand of research is opened up connecting journal governance networks to knowledge structures in the OSCM field. OM is studied separately from its reference and associated disciplines. The use of the ABS list might attract comments that the study has an implicit European perspective – however the authors do not believe this to be the case.

A systematic literature review of 434 ANP studies for a 10-year period (2012–2021) within the Scopus database was conducted using the keyword “Analytic Network Process” in articles indexed in the following two categories: (1) Business, Management and Accounting, and (2) Economics, Econometrics and Finance. Further analysis using a citation-based graph and contingency analysis approaches was performed to identify usage trends. Our findings indicate that the most common ANP applications are with sustainable supply chain management and business evaluation frameworks. There is also a trend of applications engaging stakeholders in the decision-making process. Finally, it was found that the ANP is most commonly used as part of a multicriteria multi-method (a method followed by others) or integrated decision-making (hybridization of methods) approach rather than alone. The most common use (>80%) of the ANP is as part of a multi-method or integrated method with other tools such as DEMATEL, which suggests these approaches, in particular integrated ones (>50%), are becoming the preferred method of analysis to simplify the ANP process.

Drawing on Rawls’ theory of justice, this study aims to fill this glaring gap by exploring whether and how AI could contribute to fostering a more equitable, inclusive and ethically responsible entrepreneurial ecosystem for women, help break down existing barriers, and thus, support women’s entrepreneurial endeavors in the tourism sector. Based on qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with elite informants, the study highlights significant positive externalities of AI technologies adoption, beyond the generally recognized benefits in customer engagement and personalized offerings, efficiency, and overall performance, to help female entrepreneurs in particular deal with work-life balance predicaments, unanimously considered the most significant barrier to inclusivity. The findings also emphasize how responsible AI design, adoption and governance can help deal with prevalent ethical concerns of AI in tourism, namely, bias, lack of transparency, fairness and privacy, the absence of a human-centered approach, and accountability.

In order to better explain the proposed orchestration concept, Mobility as a Service (MaaS), a technological and social complex, innovative ecosystem, was chosen. Design/methodology/approach The suggested touring orchestrating model emerges by utilizing multiple case study analyses, focusing on ecosystem construct, orchestration mechanism, and various actors of five selected mobility as service use cases, each presenting one category with unique characteristics. The analysis is complemented by a multi-vocal literature review (MLR) of secondary data. Findings The study findings reveal substantial barriers to successful collaboration between innovation ecosystem actors, using traditional ways of orchestrating the ecosystem due to competition and unwillingness to invest for the benefit of others or risk of losing their customer base to competitors by joining a MaaS ecosystem, particularly when a new actor as orchestrator is onboarded. Additionally, there is a need to increase incentives and to enhance offerings in order to generate demand and attract stakeholders toward a new innovation ecosystem like MaaS. Research limitations/implications Most of the models reviewed in this study are predominantly successful examples of mobility as a service originating from northern Europe and the Baltic region, potentially shaped by the characteristics of these markets. This regional focus represents a limitation of the study. Furthermore, the study’s conceptual nature and lack of practical testing and empirical data support are additional limitations which could be addressed in future research through empirical investigation. The results of this study could assist in shaping future research and contribute to the development of more effective orchestration models and stakeholder management frameworks for managing innovation ecosystems across different industry contexts. Practical implications The proposed touring orchestration model (TOM) provides insights not only for the actors in transportation industry but also for providers in other industries; on how to manage uncertainties and risks tied to technology and value proposition while advancing seamless cross-firm collaboration with other market actors during the formation of an innovation ecosystem. It can also facilitate the emergence of unexplored cross-industry business models by leveraging various data-sharing frameworks. The proposed model can also streamline processes and lower costs for policymakers in encouraging transportation and mobility providers to participate in MaaS, as it reduces risks and can offer greater financial advantages for these stakeholders. Originality/value The findings of this study enhance the evolving ecosystem literature by exploring orchestration amid technological and value proposition uncertainties. Additionally, this study contributes to the expanding research on MaaS business models and ecosystem orchestration by leveraging data as a service-sharing model.",2025-02-17,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,302-320,,13,63,,Management Decision,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Business ecosystem; Data as a service; Ecosystem; Innovation ecosystem; Mobility as a service; Orchestration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the field of quantum computing (QC) technologies has continued to grow in influence and maturity, and it is now poised to revolutionise software engineering. However, the evaluation and prioritisation of QC challenges in the software industry remain unexplored, relatively under-identified and fragmented. Objective The purpose of this study is to identify, examine and prioritise the most critical challenges in the software industry by implementing a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP). Method First, to identify the key challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review by drawing data from the four relevant digital libraries and supplementing these efforts with a forward and backward snowballing search. Second, we followed the F-AHP approach to evaluate and rank the identified challenges, or barriers. Results The results show that the key barriers to QC adoption are the lack of technical expertise, information accuracy and organisational interest in adopting the new process. Another critical barrier is the lack of standards of secure communication techniques for implementing QC. Conclusion By applying F-AHP, we identified institutional barriers as the highest and organisational barriers as the second highest global weight ranked categories among the main QC challenges facing the software industry. We observed that the highest-ranked local barriers facing the software technology industry are the lack of resources for design and initiative while the lack of organisational interest in adopting the new process is the most significant organisational barrier. Our findings, which entail implications for both academicians and practitioners, reveal the emergent nature of QC research and the increasing need for interdisciplinary research to address the identified challenges.",2022-07-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,106896,,,147,,Information and Software Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP); Multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM); Quantum computing; Quantum software requirement; Software process automation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative exploratory study using in-depth personal interviews with 53 Indian health insurance CXOs was conducted with a semi-structured questionnaire. Using MaxQDA software, the interview transcripts were analyzed by means of thematic content analysis technique and patterns identified based on the expert opinions. Findings A framework for the strategic imperatives of digital technology in social health insurance emerged from the study highlighting three key themes for technology implementation in the social health insurance sector – analytics for risk management, cost optimization for operations and enhancement of customer experience. The study results provide key insights about how insurers can enhance the coverage of BoP population by leveraging technology. Social implications The framework would help health insurers and policymakers to select strategic choices related to technology that would enable creation of inclusive health insurance models for BoP customers.

A critical research gap exists in understanding novel waste utilization techniques and their associated societal implications. This study proposes a comprehensive assessment framework that incorporates criteria of economic, technical, environmental, energy&water, regulations&policy, social, and resiliency. Thirty sustainability indicators were evaluated across nineteen potential slag utilization alternatives. To determine the weights of criteria and indicators, three advanced Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) methods including Spherical F-AHP (SF-AHP), interval-valued Pythagorean F-AHP (IVPF-AHP), and randomized weighted F-AHP (RWF-AHP) were compared and the optimal method was identified. Moreover, a novel Fuzzy-Likert Scaling Analysis (FLSA) was proposed to prioritize alternatives. FLSA compared different membership functions (MFs) of triangular, Pythagorean, parabolic, and eighth-order polynomials to find the best MFs. By combining optimized F-AHP, fuzzy-Delphi method (FDM), and FLSA, the framework provides a measurable Slag Management Sustainability Score (SMSS). In a case study examining optimal strategic planning for supplying steel slags, Foolad Mobarakeh Company (FMC) was selected. The most sustainable alternative, “Feed for factories,” achieved an SMSS of 63.633 and 65.049 based on SF-AHP and RWF-AHP, respectively.

BIM provides all required tools and automations to achieve end-to-end communication, data exchange and information sharing among collaborators. Accordingly, virtual 3D models, created by the BIM process, delivered as physical assets, monitored in real-time and managed using Building Management Systems (BMS), can adopt the Internet of Things (IoT) designs and services.

One way to improve that process is to objectify the decisions with facts. Data-driven Decision Support Systems (data-driven DSS), and more specifically business intelligence (BI) intend to achieve this. Organizations invest massively in the development of BI data-driven DSS and expect them to be adopted and to effectively support decision makers. This raises many technical and methodological challenges, especially regarding the design of BI dashboards, which can be seen as the visible tip of the BI data-driven DSS iceberg and which play a major role in the adoption of the entire system. In this paper, the dashboard content is investigated as one possible root cause for BI data-driven DSS dashboard adoption or rejection through an early empirical research. More precisely, this work is composed of three parts. In the first part, the concept of cognitive loads is studied in the context of BI dashboards and the informational, the representational and the non-informational loads are introduced. In the second part, the effects of these loads on the adoption of BI dashboards are then studied through an experiment with 167 respondents and a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis. The result is a Dashboard Adoption Model, enriching the seminal Technology Acceptance Model with new content-oriented variables to support the design of more supportive BI data-driven DSS dashboards.

Given the absence of a scoping literature review focused on recent progress in ZCUBs, this research paper aims to provide reference and support for their wider implementation. Using the PRISMA protocol, 226 articles spanning the period from 2000 to 2024 were selected and classified thematically, identifying key drivers, strategies, and the influential factors on energy and environmental performances, carbon emissions, and overall sustainability impacts on urban built environments. Based on the findings from a scientometric analysis of the past 25 years (2000–2024), the approach to urban building’s design and performance has undergone a remarkable transformation. Initially, efforts were concentrated on improving energy efficiency to reduce energy consumption and enhance the comfort of individual buildings. However, as the realities of climate change have intensified and digital advancements -especially in the Artificial Intelligence field- have triggered tectonic shifts in all fields of science including the building sector, the scope has expanded significantly. Buildings are now designed not only to optimize energy use and enhance indoor comfort but also to minimize building’s life cycle carbon emissions (LCCEs) and actively incorporate renewable energy sources, while considering their urban contexts. This evolution is driven by stricter regulatory and legal obligations along with the development of advanced technologies and digital tools, enabling urban buildings to transition from passive energy consumers to active, sustainable grid-interactive prosumers. As part of smart grid deployment, this shift enables urban buildings to achieve net-zero or even net-positive energy status, within the context of zero-energy communities, in a very radically different way than it is today. From this perspective, ZCUB's design broadly covers embodied carbon in construction materials, passive and active energy efficiency measures, on-site and/or off-site renewable energy sources’ adoption, and integration with urban energy systems and infrastructure. It also encompasses digital tools for energy and environmental performance simulations, lifecycle assessment methodologies, technological innovations and policy frameworks that support decarbonization at urban building’s scale. That said, considering the broad disciplinary landscape of ZCUBs, this scoping review identifies common trends and challenges, highlights gaps in the existing literature, and proposes future research directions aimed at advancing carbon neutrality within the building sector and its wider urban context.",2025-07-15,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,113116,,,280,,Building and Environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Carbon neutrality; Climate change; Urban building energy modeling; Zero carbon building; Zero energy building,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show how, while these last describe digital-supported participation processes as (at least potentially) able to bootstrap an open governance agenda, local urban initiatives suggest the need to question this technology-optimistic imaginary. A critical analysis of crowdsourcing for public governance prototyped and piloted in some European cities makes it evident that at local level, alternative imaginaries are emerging. We describe them in this paper as the “receptive city” (often adopted by public institutions and administration), and the “do-it-yourself city” (referring to the critical perspective of (digital) social activists) imaginaries, both emerging from local-based experiences and debates; and clarify their convergence and divergence how these differs from the above-mentioned “hyperconnected city” imaginary prefigured by EC guidelines.

The results show that perceptions of innovativeness, effectiveness, sustainability and replicability, but not of importance, significantly influence judges’ recommendations. These findings demonstrate that innovativeness, sustainability and replicability are important in evaluations of best practices, in addition to effectiveness. Specifically, innovativeness is as important as effectiveness, which indicates that judges perceive innovation to be closely linked to best practices. In addition, the empirical results partly refute the criticism that sustainability and replicability are not considered in evaluations of best practices.

It also allows local and foreign intermediaries to coordinate and match resources among different interests and actors. The effectiveness of multilevel governance in eco-city projects is conditioned by intermediary institutions’ resources and capabilities.

However, it is unclear as to the extent to which cyber-attacks can threaten border operations. Interestingly, no extensive research has been conducted into this topic, possibly due to the complexity and diversity of border controls. This paper specifies the cyber-threat landscape of border control infrastructures to assist professionals in assessing the relevant cybersecurity risks. Border control infrastructures are complex environments and relevant risks might not be easily identified. To investigate the cyber-threat landscape of these infrastructures, a mixed research method, combining qualitative and quantitative results, and using border-related expert interviews and risk analysis investigation was chosen. Key contributions of this work include the classification of a widespread set of border assets, the description of the profiles of threat actors and their potential synergies, the specification of a threat taxonomy applicable to all border types, and the identification of potential areas of vulnerability. Moreover, through the risk analysis investigations, exemplary input is developed to guide professionals while applying a risk assessment methodology in the context of border control infrastructures. The paper concludes with future directions addressed to policy makers and border professionals.",2022-03-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,100503,,,36,,International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Border control; Critical infrastructure; Cyber security; Threat landscape; Threat modeling; Threat profiling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the capacity of organisations is generally thought to be related to organisational performance, there is a lack of empirical insights concerning the contribution of procurement capacity of public organisations towards the attainment of procurement objectives in infrastructure procurement. Thus, it is unclear which aspects of the capacity of public procurement organisations contribute the most to the attainment of procurement objectives in the procurement of infrastructure. This research sought to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach The research used a survey of public procurement professionals which yielded 590 responses. Findings Exploratory factor analysis of 23 organisational capacity items revealed three components of organisational procurement capacity: “management of the procurement process”; “human and physical resources”; and “financial resources and management”. Multiple regression modelling of the relationship between the components and the attainment of 12 procurement objectives further reveals that there is a significant positive relationship between the three components and all the objectives. However, “management of the procurement process” emerged as the greatest contributor to the attainment of seven objectives, whereas “human and physical resources”, and “financial resources and management” were the greatest contributor to the attainment of one objective and four objectives, respectively. Originality/value The study provides strong empirical justification for investment in the development of procurement capacity of public agencies involved in procurement of infrastructure. Furthermore, procurement capacity development of specific capacity components can be prioritised based on the relative contribution of capacity components to the attainment of desired procurement objectives.

Modern businesses utilize AI systems to optimize their operations, make strategic decisions and to enhance quality etc. On the other hand, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) constitute a sizeable portion of the global economy and are the main drivers of economic development. The highly saturated market of SMEs demands them to adopt innovative digital technologies to stay competitive. However, there are various challenges including ethics, transparency, privacy, biases, financial limitations, infrastructural incapacity, and others associated with the adoption of AI. Most SMEs are unable to measure AI readiness since it is a multi-faceted procedure that requires developing a multidimensional construct with variable elements. Therefore, this work proposes a Technology-Organization-Environment-Human (TOEH) framework that comprehensively captures the possible dimensions of AI readiness and their related elements. The model carries out this evaluation at the micro level by assessing the attributes of all dimensional elements for each of the four dimensions. In the pr-assessment phase, severity index for each attribute of the dimensional elements is formulated through expert review that serves as a metric to assess AI readiness. In the assessment phase, firm’s capabilities are identified through a comprehensive questionnaire and each of the dimensional elements is assigned a readiness state (informal, struggling, approaching and desirable state). Based upon the state of these dimensional elements and the pre-determined severity ratings, a readiness rating is assigned to the four dimensions. The proposed model is also capable of suggesting a comprehensive action plan based on the organizational inadequacies. It is iterative that requires SMEs to reassess their readiness until it achieve the desired or required readiness state.",2025-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,774-783,,,253,,Procedia Computer Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AI readiness; AI Readiness assessment model (AIRAM); Artificial intelligence (AI); Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs); Small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key research gap that remains unfilled is the role of national states in the transition of urban governance from a singular logic of growth. This paper attempts to reveal how the national state and its top-down territorial logic shape this transition in China. Based on a theoretical engagement between political and economic geographers' approaches to city-regional development, we conceptualise a ‘central-local state strategic coupling’ between national geopolitical goals and local entrepreneurial strategies. We argue that municipalities endeavour to plug their city-regions into national geopolitical strategies to unlock the resources (e.g., land and financial capital) necessary for the implementation of local entrepreneurial strategies. The central state strategically selects certain city-regions to develop by privileging their municipalities' access to key resources to facilitate local entrepreneurial strategies. Thus, the central state aligns city-regional development/transformation to its geopolitical goals/strategies in a subtle and depoliticised manner. We substantiate this argument by taking local economic space production as a lens, with a comparative analysis of the emerging urban entrepreneurial/economic space production strategies in three Chinese inland cities.",2024-03-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,103062,,,109,,Political Geography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,China; Entrepreneurial state; State strategic coupling; Urban entrepreneurialism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, as it's a key factor for guaranteeing businesses' achievement, however, the profound discussion about the BPR is very rare as far as we know. We need more studies regarding the subject due to the absence of BPR works in the logistics industry. Hence, this study investigates the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of BPR for logistics companies, leading the managers and writers active in BPR, and making them aware of the present, past and future trends in this discipline. Design/methodology/approach As BPR is a necessary foundation for ensuring enterprise systems' success, this study will systematically investigate the BPR in logistics. The proposed BPR in logistics research classification framework is based on a comprehensive literature review, which concentrates on peer-reviewed journal papers published until 2019. A total of 22 academic sources have been retrieved and analyzed in terms of research purpose and nature, the employed method, theoretical approach and analysis level. Findings The findings of this paper showed that BPR companies outperform the non-BPR ones regarding information computing, technology uses, organizational architecture, coordination and all key logistics procedures. The results can motivate non-BPR logistics organizations to reassess the feasibility of these plans. Research limitations/implications This paper provides an overview of BPR to young academics.

In turn, researchers need to become more innovative in terms of their research techniques when examining BPR implementation. Practical implications This paper guides researchers and practitioners to insight into published research work and their findings. The findings are valuable to logistics firms in an emerging market, as logistics resources may affect logistics service costs and quality. Also, it discusses indications for future research in BPR. It emphasizes the need to bridge the lacuna between BPR theory and evidence-based practice. Furthermore, it provides a better understanding of BPR implementation, which can be applied toward overcoming operational difficulties during the implementation process. Originality/value This paper fulfills an identified need for a comprehensive classification framework of BPR in logistics studies. We can consider it as the first-evaluated methodically gathered workaround BPR in logistics. It essentially provides both academics and practitioners with a conceptual map of existing BPR in logistics research and points out future research opportunities.",2021-07-27,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,3009-3024,,10,51,,Kybernetes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Business process; Logistics; Re-engineering; Systematic literature review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to perform the analysis, we use microdata from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, occupation-level data on automation degree and automation risk and a technological classification of occupations in 4 terrains. We find that the current technological change is playing a significant role in the early retirement decisions, although it affects heterogeneously certain groups in the sample (regarding gender, education level and job status). This fact leads to a contradiction between governments trying to delay retirement ages and labour markets trying to expel workers earlier. Therefore, we conclude that, in order to elaborate policies on ageing and retirement, the effect of new labour-saving technologies in older worker’s decisions must be taken into account. We propose that the delay in statutory retirement ages should be accompanied by training programs and/or policies promoting self-employment for workers at risk of ending their working lives prematurely. Furthermore, the programs aimed to relocate middle-age workers displaced from their original occupations should focus on finding a new occupation among those which are less affected by automation processes.",2023-02-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,100443,,,24,,The Journal of the Economics of Ageing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ageing; Automation; Early retirement; Technological change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This theme is considered within the context of the Korean culture of Shim-Cheong, a state focused on “we-ness,” and Cheong. The study results reveal three important aspects of empathy for public relations practitioners: 1) an empathic appraisal that allows evaluation of public emotions, 2) a sensitivity that enables detection of/predicts a change in public mood, and 3) sympathetic arousal that ensures sincere communication of empathy in a crisis. When the public perceives organizations and their issues as problematic, public affect changes from positive to negative. Empathy as capacity, intuition, and attitude allows public relations practitioners to determine when public affect has significantly changed South Koreans in the culture of Shim-Cheong. Since South Koreans tend to express positive moods more readily than negative emotions, practitioners can use an affect monitoring system to identify social trends and perform more in-depth analyses to assess contextual meanings and identify potential risks.",2024-12-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,102506,,5,50,,Public Relations Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(심정: 心情); Empathic appraisal; Empathy; Public affect; Public relations practice; Sensitivity; South Korea; Sympathetic arousal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We screened 136 studies and conducted bibliometric-performance and science-mapping analyses to identify research topics and trends. We synthesized diverse definitions and measurements of food accessibility, analyzed barriers affecting food accessibility, and established a three-tier taxonomy that maps specific barriers onto the three dimensions of food accessibility and five barrier classes. For each barrier class, we traced the causal chain and summarized the interventions reported in the literature. A brief comparison between sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe shows that barriers and interventions vary by region.

This paper has examined significant developments in green technologies focusing on microgrids and decentralized energy systems, which have transformed energy production by encouraging independent, sustainable, and local power sources. There is a lot of unrealized potential for producing clean energy from waves and tides using ocean energy, an underutilized renewable resource. In Addition, the effectiveness of carbon capture technologies in lowering industrial carbon emissions and its possible influence on attempts to mitigate climate change have been examined. Green chemistry has been highlighted for its potential to revolutionize conventional production by reducing waste and toxic chemicals, while advancements in waste management have been acknowledged for their ability to transform waste into useful resources by means of procedures like energy recovery and recycling. The findings highlighted the need for continuous innovation and policy support to expedite the integration of these technologies into sustainability frameworks.",2025-06-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,5410-5426,,,13,,Energy Reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Carbon Capture Technology; Decentralized Energy Systems; Environmental Sustainability; Green Chemistry; Ocean Energy; Waste Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the name of urban innovation, CIUP is a policy instrument that brings together, early in the design phase of urban development projects, extended teams of real estate developers and other actors who usually intervene downstream in the development process. We explore these calls as a form of real estate led start-up urbanism and analyse its modalities in Greater Paris, with the first edition of the Inventing the Greater Paris Metropolis (IGPM) call as a case study. We begin by tracing the genealogy of CIUPs and their particular articulation of urban innovation and urban development principles. In the remainder of the paper, we explore the implications of such urban innovation and spatial planning hybrids, by honing in on the relational work of real estate developers, i.e. the production of social relationships and networks that enables real estate developers adherence to the political ambitions during the bidding process. After establishing their centrality in the social networks defined by IGPM, we explore the apparent paradox between projects that are perceived as ordinary by call organizers and a visible effervescence of the urban planning milieu, including recruitment practices within real estate development firms, the emergence of small operators embodying imaginaries of urban innovation and the growing role of consultancies in supporting developers in responding to public authorities’ ambitions. In the final empirical section of the paper, we focus on real estate developers’ innovation strategies as a way of understanding the apparent contradiction between project content and the changing organizational landscape of the urban development milieu. In the concluding section, we bring these elements together through a discussion of the policy outputs and outcomes of CIUPs in general, and of IGPM in particular.",2022-08-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,100625,,,162,,Progress in Planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Calls for innovative urban projects; Greater Paris; Real estate developers; Relational work; Start-up urbanism; Urban innovation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the way towards a circular built environment, governmental policy support is viewed as an important enabler. However, most existing policies are insufficient to address complex CE challenges and there are substantial knowledge gaps in understanding CE policy-making from a systemic perspective in the construction industry. This literature review investigates construction CE based on the five-stage policy cycle developed in the domain of public policy. Our main finding is that there is a lack of integrated policy-making frameworks to manage construction projects based on CE. The five-stage-policy model is not widely recognized by scientific communities or industrial practitioners to understand CE policy-making as a dynamic, interactive, and iterative cycle. Therefore, we propose an integrated CE policy-making cycle based on the explicit alignment between the state-of-the-art and the classical policy model. Furthermore, the lack of policy integration is considered as one of the critical research gaps and we propose a bi-directional policy-making mechanism to conceptualize the integrated processes of policy implementation and evaluation. The proposed frameworks address current knowledge gaps and serve as theoretical guidelines for public and private actors to understand more complex CE policy-making in the reality. Finally, we encourage interdisciplinary research to enhance integrated CE policy-making in the construction industry by 1) exploring the synergistic effect of CE policy packages on the construction life cycle, and 2) creating a streamlined, transparent, and collaborative policy-making environment based on Information & Communication Technologies.",2022-08-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,106359,,,183,,"Resources, Conservation and Recycling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Circular economy; Construction industry; Policy cycle; Public policy; Systematic literature review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its potential lies in optimising existing business models and creating innovative ones based on various technologies, making them fit for the future by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fulfilling future decarbonization goals. In order to ensure a successful digital transformation towards decarbonization, managers have to assess the capabilities of their organisation and competently oversee their journey by defining a clear path employing digital maturity models. For this purpose, the analysis focused on published literature concerning digital maturity models developed to guide organisations in navigating their digital transformation journey. A systematic literature review of 36 selected digital maturity models is presented in this paper. These models overlook decarbonisation measures and focus solely on demonstrating digital capabilities, efficiency and profit growth. Therefore, a maturity model for digital decarbonization encompassing dimensions of decarbonization goals, business model innovation, customers and suppliers, products and services, employees, collaboration, processes and activities, data, and IT-infrastructure, -security and -technology has been developed. It assists organisations in reducing their carbon footprint by strategically and effectively leveraging digital technologies. The proposed model has five maturity levels: assess and align, engage and refine, innovate and collaborate, optimize and personalize, and transform and decarbonize.

Although the attention on SCP tools and CE has growth, no studies have investigated the linkages between these two topics. To bridge this gap, the aim of this study is to provide a literature review on the integration between CE and SCP tools. The revisited material consisted of 455 studies and was evaluated using a systematic approach. By critically analysing 35 papers, the study identified EMS and Ecodesign as the tools with the highest level of integration with CE, while the other tools seem to be characterized by a “stand-alone” approach.

This paper investigates travel demand on Express Lanes during two time periods: before the pandemic (from January 2020 to mid-March 2020) and during the pandemic (from mid-March 2020 to the end of May 2020). A large data set of trips observed on Express Lanes derived from transponders is combined with vehicle probe measures of travel times and used to estimate the willingness to pay to travel on Express Lanes. The analysis reveals that not all Express Lane assets are equal, with the longer Express Lane demonstrating better performance than the shorter one. Peak hours experienced a more significant impact than off-peak hours, reflecting the heightened flexibility in travelers' schedules during the pandemic. The proposed econometric model quantifies the increase in willingness to pay for Express Lanes, which went up to $36 and $34 per hour on the two assets from the values of $26 and $28 per hour estimated before the pandemic, which can be justified by the observed lower market shares during the pandemic.",2024-04-01,2025-10-16 11:51:20,2025-10-16 11:51:20,,104037,,,182,,Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following the protocol from Pagani, Kovaleski and Resende (2015), called Methodi Ordinatio, to select the relevant literature on this topic. The analysis of papers selected was carried out following the procedures of categorical content analysis (Bardin, 1977). Findings In all, 68 full papers were analyzed from Science Direct and Web of Science. The results present the main characteristics of publications analyzed and the authors propose some categories of strategic practices related to public procurement that are in turn related to: sustainability, partnerships and supplier management, information systems and technology and other issues. Research limitations/implications The main limitations of this paper are: the publication period considered of the articles selected is from January 2012 to March 2017; the databases Science Direct and Web of Science are selected as the sources of articles; the Methodi Ordinatio is used as the basic protocol of the SLR and, consequently, the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the steps of the protocol are used. Practical implications Showing how the public procurement can be strategic, this paper highlights the benefits of best procurement practices; similarly, it highlights those practices adopted by the private sector, which can highly contribute to the creation of value in public services that are aligned with the concept of obtaining “the best value for money”. Social implications The incorporation of strategic practices in public procurement can result in the best expenditure of public resources and the reduction of corruption in the process of procurement. Originality/value This paper contributes to synthesize the knowledge on strategic procurement, a topic exploited by few people in the public organizations. It differentiates from other literature reviews already published, considering that these studies do not deal, specifically, with public procurement and, also, do not use protocols of SLR.

Design/methodology/approach In total, 52 papers were deemed to be relevant to the analysis. These works were critiqued using a framework that addressed geographical contexts, topics, methodologies and theoretical frameworks. Findings This review highlights the uneven level of development of the academic debate between North America, the UK and continental Europe, and identifies the different theoretical frameworks that construe the body of literature in each region. In addition, the findings show the scant offer of work on the impact that the digital economy has on FE, as well as the reduced number of studies which have focused on certain vulnerable groups and the access to some financial services. Social implications The studies reviewed have not analyzed the specific needs of vulnerable groups while considering the different contexts and pathways to exclusion. The evaluation of solutions and strategies to achieve inclusion is one of the least addressed aspects in the literature. Originality/value The paper synthesizes the main contributions of the top literature on the redefinition of FI/FE in developed countries, the role of fringe services and new determinants of exclusion. The proliferation of studies regarding FI in low- and middle-income countries has generated a great amount of meta-analysis and systematized reviews of asymmetric results. However, no systematized literature review on the broad scope of FI/FE in developed countries has been published in the last decade.

To address this challenge, researchers need to break existing knowledge boundaries by seeking potential collaborations. However, when identifying and evaluating partners, existing studies have failed to explore patent technology information, patent citation information, and the complex collaborative relationships among patent holders. This results in an incomplete and inaccurate identification and evaluation of potential R&D partners. In response, this study proposes a multilayer network framework based on patent data to identify and evaluate potential R&D partners. This framework considers patent technical information, citation information, and collaboration among patentees. The method consists of three key stages. First, a network of collaboration between patentees, a knowledge network, and a patent citation network are constructed. Second, complementarity metrics are proposed on the basis of the combination of similarity and heterogeneity to identify potential R&D partners. Finally, potential R&D partners are further evaluated and determined by analyzing competitive or collaborative relationships. The proposed method is verified through a case study of unmanned ship technology. This method provides a more comprehensive perspective for R&D partner identification and evaluation.

This paper sheds light on what is happening today and what the trajectories for the future are, with particular respect to the implications for supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach The dynamic literature review method called Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA) was adopted. It combines the Systematic Literature Review approach and bibliographic network analyses, and it relies on objective measures and algorithms to perform quantitative literature-based detection of emerging topics. Findings The focus of the literature seems to be on threats that are internal to the extended supply chain rather than on external attacks, such as viruses, traditionally related to information technology (IT). The main arising risk appears to be the intentional or non-intentional leakage of information. Also, papers analyze the implications for information sharing coming from “soft” factors such as trust and collaboration among supply chain partners. Opportunities are also highlighted and include how information sharing can be leveraged to confront disruptions and increase resilience. Research limitations/implications The adopted methodology allows for providing an original perspective on the investigated topic, that is, how information sharing in supply chains and related risks are evolving over time because of the turbulent advances in technology. Practical implications Emergent and highly critical risks related to information sharing are highlighted to support the design of supply chain risks strategies. Also, critical areas to the development of “beyond-the-dyad” initiatives to manage information sharing risks emerge.

Platform owners play a critical role in such platforms’ governance and in designing platform-based business models (BMs) to foster value creation within platform ecosystems. Given the complex architecture of B2B platforms, platform owners must continuously renew their capabilities and shift their mindset throughout the platform lifecycle to innovate new platform-based BMs, and they increasingly use AI tools for this purpose. However, little research on business model innovation (BMI) has focused on how managers can shift their mindsets to support the evolution of digital platforms or how AI can support these shifts. Therefore, this study investigates how AI is advancing BMI in the platform context and what mindset shifts must occur in managers. We focused on nine traditional firms that are B2B platform owners and interviewed 15 managers. Our findings show that AI plays three distinct roles in the evolution of a digital platform’s BMI: AI as Optimizer, as Expander, and as Creator. Our findings emphasize that AI-powered BMI in platform ecosystems is not solely technology driven but also requires significant shifts in managers’ mindsets.

Although, the state of the art mostly focuses on building models to assess the digital maturity of companies, considering instead the impact on the labor market as a hazy issue. Moreover, the literature tends to offer qualitative approaches to the topic, making the results uncertain; on the other side, quantitative ones tend to be mainly applied on structured databases, while the supply and demand of competences (findable in CVs, vacancies or firm’s job profiles) are less treated.

To reach the goal, a data-driven approach based on text mining techniques is applied to a case study. In particular the present methodology makes use of a previously developed enriched dictionary of technologies and methods 4.0 (Chiarello et al., 2018). The source is used to analyze job profiles’ descriptions belonging to Whirlpool, a multinational company with a structured database of jobs and skills. The process allows the identification of technologies, techniques and related skills contained in job descriptions. Starting from these, the Industry 4.0 impact on each job profile is measured. Finally, the metadata of the job profiles are analyzed to evaluate to which extent the skills of profiles 4.0-ready and non-4.0-ready differ. In the end, the work provides a framework for estimating the Industry 4.0 readiness of enterprises’ human capital which demonstrates to be fast, adaptable and reusable.",2020-06-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,103222,,,118,,Computers in Industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Case-Study; Data Mining; Human Resource Management; Industry 4.0; Job description; Job profiles; Named Entity Recognition; Natural Language Processing; O*NET; Skill Literature Map; Skills; Technology 4.0; Text Mining; Whirlpool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure.",2018-10-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,257-281,,,94,,Automation in Construction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM); Building Information Modeling (BIM); Civil information Modeling (CiM); Civil Integrated Management (CIM); Emerging technologies; Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Literature review; Transportation infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The process of evaluating an organization's supply chain design principles and manufacturing sustainability entails incorporating various sources of information, which are typically uncertain, incomplete, and subjective in nature. Particularly when various organizations are confronted with significant principles such as a lack of interoperability, decentralization, virtualization, real-time and capabilities, service orientation, and so on. Using graph theory and a matrix approach (GTMA), this article attempts to analyze the interaction between design principles-related factors with a focus on operational excellence, growth and sustainability in supply chains by considering the business of Industry 4.0. We have considered electrical equipment manufacturing Industry 4.0 as test ground. Based on a literature review and expert opinions, we identified several key principles, and then explored the most significant one using graph theory and a matrix approach. The findings indicate that autonomy has been evaluated as the most significant challenge to manage design principles most effectively for sustainable manufacturing in the Industry 4.0 context. Therefore, organizations must enhance autonomous systems capable of operating and making decisions alone, without relying on external instructions or support, in order to achieve sustainability. This and the other identified principles to achieving corporate supply chain sustainability are ranked in this paper. These findings will be useful for managers and policymakers managing the interaction between people and processes, as well as corporate sustainability management in Industry 4.0-based supply chain organizations. The unique contributions of this paper can aid in the improvement of design principles and the sustainability of emerging economies' Industry 4.0 perspectives.",2024-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,100027,,,3,,Sustainable Manufacturing and Service Economics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Design principles for sustainable manufacturing; Graph theory and matrix approach (GTMA); Industry 4.0; Supply chain sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this respect, the interface between I4.0 and CE research is a relatively young field of inquiry that has been little concerned with developments in GVCs. We systematically review 112 peer-reviewed papers in the field of I4.0 and CE to distill key future research opportunities and trends in the GVC field. We develop three specific conclusions from our literature review. First, GVCs can vary widely within the various forms of I4.0 technologies with the various CE practices. Second, GVC research is underdeveloped with regard to I4.0 and CE. Third, our findings are congruent with previously published studies, which recognize the importance of GVC research that has generated a rich body of knowledge, mainly from a governance perspective in operations management, supply chain management, and international business.

SC member firms’ digital capabilities (as routinized and integrated resource bundles) have the potential to address these challenges, yet their nature and differentiated impacts on engineering versus socio-ecological resilience are not well understood in the present literature. The purpose of this study is to address these gaps. First, a comprehensive taxonomy of five digital capabilities (labelled LogisticsTech, SecureData, ClientValue, InsightDecision, and InnovateTech) is developed, along with a set of nine resilience criteria/sub-criteria useful for resiliency evaluation. This was achieved through using a narrative literature review, a content analysis, validated by a Delphi study, and semi-structured interviews. Second, the relative impacts of these capabilities on resilience are assessed through pairwise comparison, network analysis, and system dynamics modelling across six Australian agri-food SCs (Grains, Red Meat, Dairy, Horticulture, Seafood, and Wine). The study findings reveal that Australian agri-food SC members’ digital capabilities play distinct but interconnected roles in enhancing resilience, with their impact varying across persistence (engineering), adaptation, and transformation (socio-ecological) over different time frames. LogisticsTech is crucial for short-term, while SecureData safeguards long-term persistence. Moreover, InsightDecision supports immediate adaptation, ClientValue facilitates long-term adaptation, and InnovateTech drives systemic transformation and future-ready SCs.

The exponential increase in volumes and rates of data acquisition over the last century, combined with advances in instruments, analytical methods and an increasing variety of data types analysed, has necessitated the development of new ways of data curation, access and sharing. Together with novel data processing methods, these changes have enabled new scientific insights and are driving innovation in Earth and Planetary Science research. Yet, as approaches to data-intensive research develop and evolve, new challenges emerge. As large and often global data compilations increasingly form the basis for new research studies, institutional and methodological differences in data reporting are proving to be significant hurdles in synthesising data from multiple sources. Consistent data formats and data acquisition descriptions are becoming crucial to enable quality assessment, reusability and integration of results fostering confidence in available data for reuse. Here, we explore the key challenges faced by the geo- and cosmochemistry community and, by drawing comparisons from other communities, recommend possible approaches to overcome them. The first challenge is bringing together the numerous sub-disciplines within our community under a common international initiative. One key factor for this convergence is gaining endorsement from the international geochemical, cosmochemical and analytical societies and associations, journals and institutions. Increased education and outreach, spearheaded by ambassadors recruited from leading scientists across disciplines, will further contribute to raising awareness, and to uniting and mobilising the community. Appropriate incentives, recognition and credit for good data management as well as an improved, user-oriented technical infrastructure will be essential for achieving a cultural change towards an environment in which the effective use and real-time interchange of large datasets is common-place.

The main purpose of this study is to identify the potential sustainability barriers of PSC and to investigate how Industry 4.0 can be applied in the sustainable PSC paradigms. This paper systematically reviews 33 relevant articles concerning sustainable PSC and Industry 4.0, taken from peer-reviewed academic journals over a decade (2008–2018). Based on content analysis, we find that the major challenges that inhibit inclusion of sustainability in the PSCs are: high costs and time consumption, little expertise and training, enforcement of regulations, the paucity of business incentives, ineffective collaborations and coordination across the PSC, lack of objective benchmarks, and poor end-customer awareness. The technologies and innovations based on Industry 4.0 can solve these barriers with regards to four aspects: enhancing the flexibility of the PSC for patient-centric drug supplies; improving the effectiveness of coordination and communication across different entities within the PSC; mitigating waste and pollution at different stages; and enabling a more autonomous decision-making process for supply chain managers. Our analysis reveals that future research interest should focus on: cross-linking coordination and cooperation, eco-friendly end-of-life products disposal, proactive product recall management, new benchmarks and measurement of sustainable performance, new regulation system design, and effects of incentives for sustainable activities.",2018-10-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,115-130,,,119,,Process Safety and Environmental Protection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Industry 4.0; Pharmaceutical; Supply chain; Sustainability; Sustainable operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They embody a rich diversity of cultures, traditions, languages and relationships with the land that are shared through many generations and that are distinct from those of the settler societies within which they now live. Many Indigenous peoples have a shared experience of discrimination, trauma, and violation of rights, rooted in complex sociopolitical relationships with settler societies that are still ongoing. This results in continuing social injustices and pronounced disparities in health for many Indigenous peoples around the globe. Indigenous peoples exhibit a significantly higher cancer incidence, mortality, and poorer survival compared to non-Indigenous peoples. Cancer services, including radiotherapy, have not been designed to support the specific values and needs of Indigenous populations, resulting in poorer access to cancer services for Indigenous peoples globally across the entire cancer care spectrum. Specific to radiotherapy, available evidence demonstrates disparities in radiotherapy uptake between Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients. Radiotherapy centres are also located disparately further away from Indigenous communities. Studies are limited by a lack of Indigenous-specific data to help inform effective radiotherapy delivery. Recent Indigenous-led partnerships and initiatives have helped to address existing gaps in cancer care, and radiation oncologists play an important role in supporting such efforts. In this article, we present an overview of access to radiotherapy for Indigenous peoples in Canada and Australia, with a focus on strengthening cancer care delivery through education, partnerships, and research.",2023-06-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,421-429,,2,116,,International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper evaluates the underlying factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. Objective The objective of this study is to identify the current digital health projects and studies being carried out in Pakistan, as well as the key stakeholders involved in these initiatives. We aim to follow a mixed-methods strategy and to evaluate these projects and studies through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify the internal and external factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. Methods This study aims to evaluate digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan with mixed methods. The qualitative and quantitative data obtained from field surveys were categorized according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommended building blocks for health systems research, and the data were analyzed using a SWOT analysis strategy. Results Of the digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan, 51 are studied. Of these projects, 46% (23/51) used technology for conducting research, 30% (15/51) used technology for implementation, and 12% (6/51) used technology for app development. The health domains targeted were general health (23/51, 46%), immunization (13/51, 26%), and diagnostics (5/51, 10%). Smartphones and devices were used in 55% (28/51) of the interventions, and 59% (30/51) of projects included plans for scaling up. Artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) was used in 31% (16/51) of projects, and 74% (38/51) of interventions were being evaluated. The barriers faced by developers during the implementation phase included the populations’ inability to use the technology or mobile phones in 21% (11/51) of projects, costs in 16% (8/51) of projects, and privacy concerns in 12% (6/51) of projects. Conclusions We conclude that while digital health has a promising future in Pakistan, it is still in its infancy at the time of this study. However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an increase in demand for digital health and implementation of health outcomes following global social distancing protocols, especially in LMICs. Hence, there is a need for active involvement by public and private organizations to regulate, mobilize, and expand the digital health sector for the improvement of health care systems in countries.",2020-09-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,,,9,22,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,digital health; eHealth; LMICs; mHealth; Pakistan; SWOT; telehealth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the CE principles have been applied at different scales, the construction industry's research efforts and practicalities remain limited and fragile. This study aimed at understanding the levels of circularity in the construction industry with a view to formulate viable recommendations required for achieving higher degrees of circularity. This aim is achieved by learning essential lessons from the manufacturing sector, which is considered one of CE's pioneering industries. In this paper, a scientometric review of CE research within the construction and manufacturing sectors was performed. The science mapping method was applied to quantitatively analyse relevant publications retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases. The results suggested that the construction industry centres on recycling and reuse as the main “R” strategies, while the manufacturing industry tends to achieve higher levels of circularity due to broader implementation of remanufacturing and industrial symbiosis (IS). The content analysis of some mainstream articles further identified the potential of adopting remanufacturing and IS in the construction sector. The findings suggested that higher levels of circularity in construction could be attained through the use of remanufactured components and recycled non-construction & demolition waste (CDW). An action plan comprising regulatory pull/push, business-driven, and technological push measures was formulated to guide researchers and practitioners to pursue looking-forward CE strategies. This review draws useful lessons from other sectors and offers fresh insight into ways of actualising circular construction.

Specifically, we use patent titles representing the innovation activity at one company (SAP) and perform a bibliometric analysis using our proposed framework. Enterprise software, of which SAP is a pioneering developer, must serve a wide assortment of functions for companies in many different industries. In addition, SAP's sole focus is on enterprise software and it is a market leader in the category with substantial patent activity over the last decade. Using our framework to analyze SAP's patent activity provides a demonstration of how our bibliometric analysis can summarize and identify trends in innovation in a large software company. Our results illustrate that SAP has a breadth of innovative activity spread over the three-tier software engineering architecture and a lack of topical repetition indicative of limited depth.

The purpose of this paper is to address this need by analyzing definitions, theoretical underpinnings, methods and sectors of interest within published academic articles. By doing so, the main objective is to clarify the theoretical and conceptual foundations of the prevention of corruption. Design/methodology/approach The research design consists of a systematic literature review, which uses a keyword-string search method across relevant databases. A qualitative and quantitative coding scheme was implemented to provide descriptive statistics. Findings Results show a need for methodological diversity, theoretical debate and a clarification of the definitional foundations of corruption prevention.

It is the result of four years of effort on the Horizon 2020 SmartAgriHubs (SAH) project, whose purpose was the development and connection of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) and Competence Centres (CCs) related to the agricultural sector in Europe. CCs form the backbone of DIHs and provide the digital technological infrastructure by offering advanced technical expertise, access to the latest knowledge and information on digital technologies, and other technological and scientific infrastructure. However, the lack of a general framework for technology classification in agriculture needed to be remedied, not only to specifically advance the general aim of SmartAgriHubs and DIHs to “connect the dots”, but in general, so as to facilitate a broad range of actors involved in digitalisation of agriculture. OBJECTIVE This paper sets out the conceptual framework for the classification of technologies in the agricultural sector, and the development of the “Agricultural Technology Navigator” (ATN) as an iterative tool for gathering and searching for information to support such classification, so that actors involved in the digitalization of agriculture may more easily find and communicate technologies related to digital solutions. METHODS A multi-actor, multi-disciplinary expert group was formed to identify technologies and define keywords. A literature, patent, foresights studies, and grey literature review was also carried out. Text mining techniques, using the JCR “Tool for Innovation Monitoring”, were used based on keywords selected by experts for documents analysis (+170,000,000 publications; + 22,000,000 patent applications; + 77,000 projects). Gaps in previous studies were identified to form the basis upon which to create a new classification system. Taking into account the fact that technologies are continually developing and evolving, an iterative approach was also necessary. To this end, a new tool was developed, compatible with agricultural supply chains, to gather “bottom up” information from CCs (and other actors) on innovative digital technologies and solutions. RESULTS And Conclusions The main results of all the publications, patents and projects summarized herein, provide a scientifically sound foundation for a much-needed classification of digital technologies used in agriculture. This paper analyses different dimensions or categories in which the diverse technologies can be classified and selects the most appropriate classification to describe the technologies which could be used and managed by CCs and other agricultural actors, in offering and searching for systems and competences which provide digital solutions. SIGNIFICANCE Given the importance of DIHs and CCs, and more recently European DIHs (EDIHs), in the European agricultural policy agenda and the development of the sustainable digitalization of agriculture, it is necessary to have a mechanism to appropriately classify digital technologies relevant for agriculture so that providers and users can “match-make” and easily offer, find, and decide on relevant digital tools and solutions. CCs are not the only entities that benefit from such classification. A diverse range of actors involved in the sustainable digitalisation of agriculture, such as technology companies, farm advisors, machinery and other input suppliers who develop and deal in novel and different technology innovations, can benefit from being able to describe appropriately their technologies as part of agricultural systems and solutions.",2024-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,103794,,,213,,Agricultural Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Agricultural technology navigator; Classification; Competence Centres; SmartAgriHubs; Technologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this situation has gradually changed, as carbon footprint quantification in construction waste allows for performance benchmarking with other circular economy initiatives. This study presents the first systematic review of construction waste-related carbon emission accounting methods. By analysing 108 journal articles, the review identified seven types of activities (e.g., generation, transportation, sorting, reusing, recycling, landfilling, and incineration) contributing to carbon emissions across the construction waste lifecycle. They encompass four types of emission-producing unit processes: mechanical operation, manual operation, chemical reaction, and material replacement. Each has a distinct emission accounting formula, but follows a generalized principle “Emission per unit × Unit”. Also, existing studies exhibit five evolution trends in this research field: shifting from single-stage accounting to lifecycle assessment; from simple calculation to complex conversion; from project-scale to urban-scale emission investigation and management; from accounting exercises to policy implication; and from carbon accounting to mitigation strategies. Moreover, the review sheds light on three future research directions: the need for generalisable lifecycle emission quantification frameworks, comparisons of the carbon reduction potential among various waste disposal technologies, and consideration of cost analysis into carbon emission quantification.

Charts have an important role in conveying, clarifying and simplifying the research results provided by the authors, but they present some accessibility barriers for people with low vision. This article aims to evaluate the accessibility of the statistical charts published in the library and information science (LIS) journals with the greatest impact factor. Design/methodology/approach A list of heuristic indicators developed by the authors has been used to assess the accessibility of statistical charts for people with low vision. The heuristics have been applied to a sample of charts from 2019 issues of ten LIS journals with the highest impact factor according to the ranking of the JCR. Findings The current practices of image submission do not follow the basic recommended guidelines on accessibility like color contrast or the use of textual alternatives. On the other hand, some incongruities between the technical suggestions of image submission and their application in analyzed charts also emerged. The main problems identified are: poor text alternatives, insufficient contrast ratio between adjacent colors and the inexistence of customization options. Authoring tools do not help authors to fulfill these requirements. Research limitations/implications The sample is not very extensive; nonetheless, it is representative of common practices and the most frequent accessibility problems in this context.

However, raw publication counts and raw citation count-based scholar performance assessment indicators, such as H-index or author citations, have shortcomings; for example, they ignore the impact of different citation patterns under different research topics, leading to authorship credit inflation due to full citation allocation to each author in multi-author publications. This study proposes a new scholar performance assessment indicator called the normalized scholar academic productivity (NSAP) indicator, which overcomes the issues posed by raw citation counts and publication counts-related scholar performance indicators by considering diverse aspects of scholar research achievements. The NSAP indicator considers the research topic, author sequence and author role in the author list, field-normalized journal impact when allocating citation counts to scholars, and published time. The research topic is generated by the co-keyword embedding and semantic relatedness of each keyword in order to make NSAP topic-dependent; the author sequence and role affect authorship credit allocation strategy; and field-normalized journal impact was used to assign different weights on raw publication counts and citation counts. Finally, awardees of the Derek de Solla Price Memorial Medal and the Association for Information Science and Technology's awards were used to evaluate the validity of NSAP for calculating scholar performance assessment. Results reveal outstanding topic-related scholar performance assessment properties compared to raw citation count indicators, such as H-index, author citations, and cited-by counts (i.e., total number of citing authors).",2021-11-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,101201,,4,15,,Journal of Informetrics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Authorship credit allocation, Field-normalized journal impact; Derek de Solla price memorial medal; Scholar performance assessment; The association for information science and technology's awards; Topic-dependent indicator",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information is a critical component of government and citizens’ decision-making; therefore, improvements in its availability and reliability stand to benefit many dimensions of governance, including service delivery. Service delivery is especially difficult in rural areas which contain the majority of the world’s poor but face unique logistical challenges due to their remoteness. We review the features of the recent information revolution, including increased access to information due to both technological and institutional innovations. We then raise the question of why information often fails to support the goals of improved governance and service delivery. We argue that information alone is insufficient. To be impactful, the information must be deemed relevant, in the sense of being salient and having a high perceived signal-to-noise ratio, and individuals must have both the power and incentives to act on it. Bringing all three of these factors together in any setting is challenging, particularly for rural areas, where capacity to receive, understand, and act on information is relatively low. Research failing to find significant effects of greater access to information on rural governance and service delivery has largely failed due to one of these three factors not being in place. This interpretation is broadly supported by our review of 48 empirical studies on the impacts of information on governance and service delivery. We conclude by discussing broader lessons for both development research, including randomized control trials, and the development process itself. The goals of interventions to provide information may need to be more modest, and their design may merit more scrutiny.",2020-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,104376,,,125,,World Development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Accountability; Governance; Information; Rural areas; Service delivery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It advances existing work by studying municipal level government actors in a new communications environment where social media now play an important part. Grounded in agenda setting theory, our analysis identifies police departments' social media issue priorities, analyzes the responses of their audiences to those communications, and directly compares followers' own conversation priorities with the police agenda. Our data set includes all the content from the Facebook and Twitter accounts of five similarly sized and demographically situated police departments in the U.S., plus all the tweets and posts from the followers or friends responding to those accounts over a 90-day period. We performed both manual coding and machine cluster analysis to elicit major threads of conversation. In addition to the data analytics, we conducted interviews with the five police departments to understand the similarities and differences in agenda priorities resulting from their social media goals and use. The study shows the priorities that comprise the police agenda, identifies both similarities and differences in what their audiences communicate among themselves about most frequently in the public safety domain relative to the police agenda, and finds evidence of positive response from the public to some of the agenda priorities communicated by the police. Our data also reveal that police are using social media interactively, which could, over time, advance community policing goals.

Numerous studies have proposed various methodologies and criteria to assess the green roof retrofitting potential (GRRP). However, a systematic review of assessment methodologies, indicators, and associated data remains lacking, hindering the advancement of evidence-based spatial planning. This study systematically reviews 132 peer-reviewed publications on GRRP to identify prevailing trends, synthesize methodological approaches, highlight existing knowledge gaps, and propose directions for future research. The findings reveal a relatively limited focus on GRRP assessment in tropical and desert climate zones, developing countries, and regions in the southern hemisphere. Future research should prioritize retrofitting building roofs with multifunctional systems to address the complex challenges posed by climate change. Assessment methodologies are categorized into three primary approaches: expert experience, multi-criteria decision analysis, modeling and simulations. The most frequently employed assessment indicators include roof slope, roof area, stormwater retention, building height, temperature regulation, green space, building function, and roof material. The analysis indicates a lack of standardized protocols persists across indicator selection and methodological frameworks, limiting the comparability and transferability of findings. We recommend the development of standardized assessment protocols, climate-based classification systems, and data-driven approaches for indicator selection. Additionally, an integrated framework incorporating standardized assessment criteria is essential to facilitate cross-regional comparisons.

By the means of the fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis on a sample of 77 countries, we show that 1) a country's ICT profile matters for national sustainability performance, not a single ICT element; 2) national sustainability performance is not (only) about the level of ICT development of a country, but about composition and a quality of its ICT profile; 3) there are multiple distinctive ICT profiles that may lead to high or low sustainability performance (social, economic or environmental) at the national level; and 4) environmental sustainability may have conflicting ICT-related antecedents in comparison to social and economic sustainability. These results offer two primary contributions to research focused on the role of ICTs in supporting (or deterring) sustainable development. First, moving away from simplified perspective of a country's ICT development by focusing on a country's ICT profile allows us to distinguish effects (both positive and negative) of different ICT elements, as well as to take synergies brought by technological convergences into account. This allows us to capture effects of ICT elements in their totality, avoiding to lose richness and comprehensiveness.

Rapid development through policy support has led to excellent results and leadership, while contributing to China's economic growth. Using text mining techniques, this paper conducts a hierarchical association mining of China's fishery policies based on three dimensions of policy keyword co-occurrence, policy themes and policy tools, and employs visualization methods to better reveal the dynamic evolutionary patterns of policies. Based on 5311 fishery policy texts at the national, provincial and municipal levels from 2003 to 2022 in China, three techniques of co-occurrence analysis, LDA topic modelling and similarity calculation were used to mine the texts respectively, and CiteSpace, LDAvis and ThemeRiver methods were used to visualize and analyze them. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) In terms of co-occurrence of policy keywords, there are patterns of ""progressive evolution"", ""hierarchical lag"" and ""hierarchical lagged evolution"". (2) In terms of policy themes, there is an evolutionary development of industries, enterprises, technologies and products from the macro to the micro level, and the ""hierarchical stage correlation"" feature is more obvious. (3) In terms of policy instruments, there are obvious ""environmental policies are the most numerous, demand-based policies are the second most numerous, and supply-based policies are the least numerous"", ""the hierarchy lags behind development"", ""the role of central policies is strong, but the role of local policies is weak "", and ""emphasis on project construction, but not on public services"".

We analysed a large time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have initiated “skill-based hiring” for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018 to 2023, demand for AI roles grew by 21 % as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024). Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles declined by 15 %. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI skills command a wage premium of 23 %, exceeding the value of degrees up until the PhD-level (33 %). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low.

Advances in statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, coupled with data sources such as hyperspectral and UAV-derived imagery, have transformed the practice of rice yield forecasting. Objective: This review assesses the effectiveness of such data-driven approaches for rice yield prediction, focusing on model accuracy, scalability, and generalizability, while identifying existing gaps and future directions. Methodology: A systematic review of 156 studies was conducted using PRISMA guidelines, covering machine learning models such as Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The input data comprised satellite-based indices (e.g., NDVI, MODIS), climate variables (precipitation, temperature), and ground observations. Performance metrics, such as R2, MAE, and MAPE, were analyzed to evaluate model performance across various regions and conditions. Results and conclusions: Neural Networks and Random Forest models were the most commonly used, with satellite and climate variables being integral to predictions. Key challenges identified include limited data availability, overfitting, and difficulty in generalizing models across regions and rice cultivars. Several gaps remain in standardizing evaluation metrics, incorporating ground-truth data, and adapting models for real-world agricultural decision-making. Future research should focus on integrating multiple data sources, enhancing model scalability, and developing frameworks for better uncertainty quantification.

It is expected that industries with greater symbiotic readiness are more likely to have success in implementing a circular business model. A bibliographic analysis was conducted in order to identify the IS variables and dimensions, mentioned in the literature, as necessary for implementation of a circular business model. Two dimensions were defined in this study: (i) exchange resources and (ii) exchange capacity. The exchange resources dimension diagnoses the company's ability to have the necessary exchange resources to IS implementation (water, energy, by-products, and waste). The exchange capacity dimension diagnoses the company's enabler factors to IS implementation (trust, information, access conditions, and infrastructure). After the definition of dimensions and their respective variables, an assessment tool to diagnose industrial symbiosis readiness was developed. The assessment tool is presented as a checklist format - Symbiotic Readiness Checklist (SRC). This was applied to six co-located industries in the State of São Paulo (Brazil). The proposed SRC could be used to: (a) diagnose the readiness of companies or organizations to implement industrial symbiosis; (b) be a tool in enterprise or organizational strategic planning; (c) assist the development of mechanisms to measure the number of resources consumed and waste produced in the supply chain; (d) assess the circularity of resources.",2022-03-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,916-929,,,30,,Sustainable Production and Consumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Assessment Tool; Industrial Ecology; Resources Circularity; Sustainability; Symbiosis Readiness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review guided by the PRISMA protocol was conducted to thematically analyse 83 peer-reviewed articles, drawing on the micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities. Findings Our findings reveal cognitive technologies remain overlooked in the bulk of DT literature despite their relevance to knowledge search, knowledge management and transactive memory systems as micro-foundations of DT capabilities. Based on dynamic capabilities’ aggregate dimensions, our thematic analysis suggests managers should navigate a sensing paradox of renewal drivers, a seizing paradox of innovation posture and a reconfiguring paradox of structural malleability.

A growing volume of healthcare data has been the hallmark of this digital transformation. The large healthcare datasets' complexity and their dynamic nature pose various challenges related to processing, analysis, storage, security, privacy, data exchange, and usability. Materials and Methods We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews to assess technological progress in EHR and PHR systems. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for systematic literature reviews on technological advancements that support EHR and PHR systems published between January 1, 2010, and October 06, 2020. Results The searches resulted in a total of 2,448 hits. Of these, we finally selected 23 systematic reviews. Most of the included papers dealt with information extraction tools and natural language processing technology (n = 10), followed by studies that assessed the use of blockchain technology in healthcare (n = 8). Other areas of digital technology research included EHR and PHR systems in austere settings (n = 1), de-identification methods (n = 1), visualization techniques (n = 1), communication tools within EHR and PHR systems (n = 1), and methodologies for defining Clinical Information Models that promoted EHRs and PHRs interoperability (n = 1). Conclusions Technological advancements can improve the efficiency in the implementation of EHR and PHR systems in numerous ways. Natural language processing techniques, either rule-based, machine-learning, or deep learning-based, can extract information from clinical narratives and other unstructured data locked in EHRs and PHRs, allowing secondary research (i.e., phenotyping). Moreover, EHRs and PHRs are expected to be the primary beneficiaries of the blockchain technology implementation on Health Information Systems. Governance regulations, lack of trust, poor scalability, security, privacy, low performance, and high cost remain the most critical challenges for implementing these technologies.",2021-08-01,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,104507,,,152,,International Journal of Medical Informatics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Deep learning; eHealth; Electronic health records; Medical informatics; Natural language processing; Phenotyping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach In a systematic literature review, 1106 articles indexed at Scopus were initially submitted to a bibliometric analysis. Finally, 150 papers published in a variety of academic journals specializing in the field of Entrepreneurship, KM and Higher Education were analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis to minimize mistakes in interpreting findings of collected studies. Findings KM within entrepreneurial university is a research area of growing importance. Findings show that literature on KM models and tools in the entrepreneurial university is fragmented and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis shows heterogeneous literature, but four major research streams emerge: knowledge transfer in university–industry collaboration; knowledge creation in entrepreneurship education; KM processes for university spin-offs; entrepreneurial university to support knowledge-based regional development. The results show a failure to address the implications of findings for policy makers, which risks making KM in entrepreneurial universities research irrelevant. Research limitations/implications Although different structured literature reviews (SLRs) exist separately in the field of KM and entrepreneurial universities, to the authors’ best knowledge, no studies exist in the intersection between the two fields.

Wavelet coherences and correlations have substantially increased, mostly in the low frequencies, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government securities exhibit safe haven properties for investors at the highest and lowest scales. Even if cryptocurrencies can provide hedging benefits over the full sample, these benefits seem to be diminished during the COVID-19 period.

This has recently changed, for two reasons. First, many countries have experienced political backlashes from rising spatial economic disparities. Populist movements received the highest support in economically backward regions, which had been hit by severe local shocks. By trying to foster spatial economic cohesion, regional policies have become an attempt to insure against those political trends and to save liberal democracies altogether. Second, recent theoretical and empirical research has challenged the leading paradigm of spatial equilibrium analysis, according to which place-based policies are an inefficient interference into the market-based resource allocation. In this paper, I review those arguments and how their balance has changed over time. I argue that the demand for place-based policies is likely to increase in the future, as new digital technologies might reinforce urban-rural divides. But even if the general case for place-based policies now seems to be more widely accepted, the question remains what exactly should be done and which type of programs generate the highest return.

Successful information security practice depends on tactics and strategies that situate the need for protection within organisational goals. These tactics and strategies have become progressively important as organisations are disrupted by digital technology. The locus of control is unpredictably distributed across groups within an organisation. Finding consensus about the need for security thus becomes challenging. Information security controls are an important part of the control structure but increasingly they are negotiated controls, making the process of securing as important as the security mechanisms themselves. We employ broader political and social theories of security, most notably Smith (2005), to analyse data from nine semi-structured interviews of Australian information security practitioners. Our findings delineate the interlinking concepts of securing and security. Security is straightforward. It is a state of being secure. Securing, on the other hand, is complex. It is a consensus-seeking, value-engagement process that enables the attainment of security. Through this analysis, we identify processes and techniques of securing tacitly employed by the participants. Central to effective securing practice is a participant's ability to, ‘get the security message right.’ The message is used to create an agreed value consensus across conflict-ridden environments.

How should we go about developing such ethics guidance documents with respect to emerging contexts such as new technologies, and established domains such as research in education? This paper provides a PRISMA-ETHICS informed scoping review of approaches to ethics guideline development, the structures of ethics guidelines, and their audiences and purposes drawing on the context of education and AI. Search and synthesis approach A search of scholarly and grey literature was conducted to identify both ethics guidelines and material discussing their development; n = 592 distinct items were identified, including 182 that identified via recent reviews of AI ethics guidelines. n = 47 guideline-sets were identified as ‘guidelines’. Data extraction and analysis Guidelines were analysed with respect to their development approach, audience and purpose, and structural elements through which guidance is delivered; most included statements regarding their development approach (79 %) and audience (72 %). Where evidence underpinning the guidance was discussed, it was largely at a global content level (69 %), rather than with respect to the specific context/domain of the guideline use, principles drawn on, or approaches and strategies one might adopt in navigating ethical issues (23, 29, and 21 % respectively). Across the guidelines the only universal feature was the provision of an overview statement. We conclude with recommendations regarding the development of ethics guidelines, and their structure.

A concept-to-design prototyping matrix for energy security planning inclusive of energy services is presented. It is recommended that energy security design and planning frameworks should be self-defined and government accepted at the country level to be effective for sustainable energy development. The tension between energy security and energy transition is identified as a systemic risk and the concept of a meta-indicator is introduced to measure this transition gap which is modelled along an adaptive frontier. Complexity is explored as one of the three hallmarks of risk, as well as in its contribution to measurement challenges. A multi-scale, multi-speed heuristic model of a socio-energy system transition is illustrated and indicative South African energy supply and demand baselines and risk indicators are measured. The ratio of useful exergy output to final energy input (25%) is advanced as the efficiency indicator “closest” and “earliest” to energy services, and a transdisciplinary monitoring and evaluation framework centred on jumping indicators is proposed for strategic monitoring and evaluative learning. Adaptive programmes are recommended because they are antifragile, and the concept of a resilience boundary is introduced for further development.

Existing literature conceptualises HRA mostly from an objectivist perspective, which limits understanding of actual HRA activities in the complex organisational environment. This paper therefore draws on the practice-based approach, using a novel framework to conceptualise HRA-as-practice. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a systematic literature review of 100 academic and practitioner-oriented publications to analyse existing HRA literature in relation to practice theory, using the “HRA-as-practice” frame. Findings The authors identify the main practices involved in HRA, by whom and how these practices are enacted, and reveal three topics in nomological network of HRA-as-practice: HRA technology, HRA outcomes and HRA hindrances and facilitators, which the authors suggest might actualize enactment of HRA practices. Practical implications The authors offer HR function and HR professionals a basic ground to evaluate HRA as a highly contextual activity that can potentially generate business value and increase HR impact when seen as a complex interaction between HRA practices, HRA practitioners and HRA praxis. The findings also help HR practitioners understand multiple factors that influence the practice of HRA. Originality/value This systematic review differs from the previous reviews in two ways. First, it analyses both academic and practitioner-oriented publications.

Global interest in biochar is attributed to its ability to sequester carbon in soil and to remediate aquatic environment from water pollution. As soil conditioner and/or adsorbent, biochar offers opportunity through a circular economy (CE) paradigm. While energy transition continues, progress toward low-emissions materials accelerates their advance towards net-zero emissions. However, none of existing works addresses CE-based biochar management to achieve carbon neutrality. To reflect its novelty, this work provides a critical overview of challenges and opportunities for biochar to promote CE and carbon neutrality. This article also offers seminal perspectives about strengthening biomass management through CE and resource recovery paradigms, while exploring how the unused biomass can promote net zero emissions in its applications. By consolidating scattered knowledge in the body of literature into one place, this work uncovers new research directions to close the loops by implementing the circularity of biomass resources in various fields. It is conclusive from a literature survey of 113 articles (2003–2023) that biomass conversion into biochar can promote net zero emissions and CE in the framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Depending on their physico-chemical properties, biochar can become a suitable feedstock for CE. Biochar application as soil enrichment offsets 12% of CO2 emissions by land use annually. Adding biochar to soil can improve its health and agricultural productivity, while minimizing about 1/8 of CO2 emissions. Biochar can also sequester CO2 in the long-term and prevent the release of carbon back into the atmosphere after its decomposition. This practice could sequester 2.5 gigatons (Gt) of CO2 annually. With the global biochar market reaching USD 368.85 million by 2028, this work facilitates biochar with its versatile characteristics to promote carbon neutrality and CE applications.",2023-04-15,2025-10-16 11:51:31,2025-10-16 11:51:31,,117429,,,332,,Journal of Environmental Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Biochar; Carbon neutrality; Circular economy; Climate change; Net zero emissions; Resource recovery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Along with mitigation efforts, adaptive response actions are gaining increasingly urgent importance for many regions to considerably reduce the most severe impacts of climate change on social and physical infrastructure. As the severity and frequency of climate change impacts and consequences grow fast and highly alarming, particularly for small and vulnerable coastal area (SVCA) countries, the urgency and magnitude of the crises call for immediate and more adaptive responses. This study proposes that SVCA countries, being on the frontline of climate change vulnerabilities, impacts, and risks, should prioritize their resources and capacity and focus on developing and implementing immediate, tailored, adaptive response policies, plans, and actions. Long-term mitigation efforts would not help them reduce their current or immediate vulnerability in the short-term, as long as large countries with comparably huge populations, economies, heavy industrial dependences, and extreme consumption levels do not change their courses significantly. Therefore, this study presents a framework of climate change, sustainability, resilience, risk reduction, and adaptive response as a nexus to conceptualize the problem and solutions properly. Such a framework is needed to develop synergies between climate change and immediate adaptive response for such countries.

New disruptive technologies are emerging due to recent scientific and technical developments, which profoundly affect various process systems. One such case of consideration is the algal cultivation for biomass production (ACB). A technology called an algal digital twin (ADT) has a great deal of promise to change existing ACB (For example raceway pond) into sustainable algal management systems (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Temperature, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), pH, Chlorophyll-a, etc.), and to develop their infrastructure in making them more energy efficient and cost-effective for the algal biomass cultivation. However, despite a recent increase in attention, there have not been adequate investigations exploring the challenges of deploying ADTs for controlling and monitoring ACB. This review provides a systematic literature analysis on adopting an ADT into ACB, which could address major difficulties and unresolved problems of the ACB. Also, this study identifies several key categories of hurdles, such as interconnection and semantics, facilities, acquiring data and actuation, data reliability, modelling (Artificial Intelligence of Things), simulation run, decision making, digitalization of data, accountability, as well as social concerns. Additionally, case studies for the ACB towards lipid production and wastewater treatment using ADT are reported.

Due to the economic, environmental, social, and sustainability implications, proper waste management has become a worldwide concern. In response to this problem, strategies have been implemented to develop clean energy, improve the efficiency of industrial resources, and recycle and reuse materials. As a result, the concept of industrial symbiosis (IS) has emerged as a strategy for waste utilization in a productive chain, based on physical exchanges of waste and materials, which finds ways to use the waste from one industry as inputs or raw materials for the other, all supported by business collaboration. This work aims to identify the opportunities and challenges that emerging and frontier countries have for waste utilization through the IS approach through a literature review. The needs that triggered the IS and how researchers materialized this approach to integrate the harnessing resources and materials in economic activities were identified. This paper identifies how emerging and frontier countries realize solid waste management through IS, and highlights opportunities for governments, researchers, and stakeholders to make effective decisions to achieve sustainable development, reduce environmental concerns and address current waste management issues. The literature review identified IS as an excellent way to dispose of and use the solid waste but also showed that emerging and frontier countries face many challenges in solid waste management due to the lack of policies focused on sustainability, lack of communication and trust among stakeholders, low use of technology in the industrial sector and technical barriers.",2022-08-20,2025-10-16 11:51:32,2025-10-16 11:51:32,,132607,,,363,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerging and frontiers countries; Industrial residuals; Industrial symbiosis; Recycling; Waste management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It identifies dominant themes, highlights ongoing research gaps and proposes directions for developing more inclusive and critically engaged research. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review of gender-related studies in management accounting was conducted, covering articles published in ranked “accounting journals” between 1990 and 2024. Thematic analysis was applied to synthesise key findings and highlight research gaps. Findings The study identifies four dominant themes in the literature, revealing the persistent underrepresentation of gender-focused research in management accounting. While existing studies acknowledge gender, they largely focus on workplace dynamics and overlook how management accounting practices reflect, reinforce or challenge gendered structures. The study underscores the need for deeper theoretical engagement – particularly with feminist and intersectional perspectives – to critically assess gendered power dynamics in management accounting. Research limitations/implications This study provides an impetus for advancing gender research in management accounting by promoting theoretical diversification, methodological pluralism and greater attention to intersectional and contextual dimensions.

One central assumption of one prevalent MaaS conceptualization is that transport services are bundled into service packages for monthly payment, as in the telecommunication or media service sectors. Various other forms of MaaS are being developed but all tend to offer door-to-door multi-modal mobility services, brokered via digital platforms connecting users and service operators. By drawing on literature concerned with socio-technical transitions, we address two multi-layered questions. First, to what extent can the MaaS promises (to citizens and cities) be delivered, and what are the unanticipated societal implications that could arise from a wholesale adoption of MaaS in relation to key issues such as wellbeing, emissions and social inclusion? Second, what are de facto challenges for urban governance if the packaged services model of MaaS is widely adopted, and what are the recommended responses? To address these questions, we begin by considering the evolution of intelligent transport systems that underpin the current vision of MaaS and highlight how the new business model could provide a mechanism to make MaaS truly disruptive. We then identify a set of plausible unanticipated societal effects that have implications for urban planning and transport governance. This is followed by a critical assessment of the persuasive rhetoric around MaaS that makes grand promises about efficiency, choice and freedom. Our conclusion is that the range of possible unanticipated consequences carries risks that require public intervention (i.e. steering) for reasons of both efficiency and equity.",2020-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:32,2025-10-16 11:51:32,,35-49,,,131,,Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Equity; Governance; Mobility as a service; Smart mobility; Technological transition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cyberattacks cause significant data breaches in digital health information systems, which threaten patient safety and privacy. Objective From a sociotechnical perspective, this paper explores why digital health care systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks and provides sociotechnical solutions through a systematic literature review (SLR). Methods An SLR using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) was conducted by searching 6 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Springer) and a journal (Management Information Systems Quarterly) for articles published between 2012 and 2022 and indexed using the following keywords: “(cybersecurity OR cybercrime OR ransomware) AND (healthcare) OR (cybersecurity in healthcare).” Reports, review articles, and industry white papers that focused on cybersecurity and health care challenges and solutions were included. Only articles published in English were selected for the review. Results In total, 5 themes were identified: human error, lack of investment, complex network-connected end-point devices, old legacy systems, and technology advancement (digitalization). We also found that knowledge applications for solving vulnerabilities in health care systems between 2012 to 2022 were inconsistent. Conclusions This SLR provides a clear understanding of why health care systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks and proposes interventions from a new sociotechnical perspective. These solutions can serve as a guide for health care organizations in their efforts to prevent breaches and address vulnerabilities. To bridge the gap, we recommend that health care organizations, in partnership with educational institutions, develop and implement a cybersecurity curriculum for health care and intelligence information sharing through collaborations; training; awareness campaigns; and knowledge application areas such as secure design processes, phase-out of legacy systems, and improved investment. Additional studies are needed to create a sociotechnical framework that will support cybersecurity in health care systems and connect technology, people, and processes in an integrated manner.",2024-01-01,2025-10-16 11:51:42,2025-10-16 11:51:42,,,,,26,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,cybersecurity; data breaches; health care systems; medical device; patient safety; protected health information; ransomware; secure systems development; sociotechnical; training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research on capabilities that enable firms to be agile in the so called VUCA environments, is still nascent. Hence, it is important to explore the antecedents of firm agility and to identify the factors enabling them to better compete. Even more so in the case of SMEs, as they are more vulnerable in hypercompetitive business environments and, at the same time, agility has been less studied in this context. Focusing on SMEs, the study investigates three antecedents of agility, namely digital technologies capability, relational capability and innovation capability, and the effects of agility on three outcomes, namely financial performance, product, and process innovation. Our findings indicate that these capabilities contribute to build organizational agility in SMEs and that, in turn, agility has a positive impact on performance, thus confirming that agility contributes to the success of SMEs and that digital technologies play a central role in this process. Thus, it is of strategic importance for SMEs to increase their efforts to develop these capabilities to build enduring businesses.

The cardinal motivation behind this research is to move towards efficient biomass resource management in order to overcome environmental uncertainty and ambiguity and mitigate adverse environmental impacts and climate change. The research literature and international experts’ opinions were reviewed to present the biomass EEEGOT model. This important study came up with three new methods: a Circular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (CIF-SWARA) method for ranking challenges; a Circular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (CIF-DEMATEL) method for picking the best challenges; and a Circular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (CIF-QFD) method to put environmental challenges in order of importance and deal with them. According to the weight evaluation results, the organizational dimension (0.188) and environmental dimension (0.177) had the highest weights. Thus, they are considered the major challenges that require immediate attention from managers, decision-makers, and stakeholders. Additionally, the findings of conceptual modeling (TISM) indicated that culture, leadership, governance policy, human resources, and regulatory barriers are the most fundamental components affecting other components. The novelty of this study lies in the theoretical expansion of the research literature by proposing a model through a comprehensive approach to circular bioeconomy that can be used as a base by relevant decision-makers and researchers. However, to expand fuzzy science, three methods were developed in fuzzy logic. Therefore, since biomass management requires a comprehensive understanding of the challenges facing it, their precise prioritization, and the use of smart strategies and solutions, this research provides insights, useful tools, and solutions for organizational and industrial managers, decision makers, and scholars. They can use these resources to investigate, prioritize, and overcome these challenges. On the other hand, the focus of this research is on ignoring the linear economy and applying the circular concept in order to achieve several goals, including sustainable development, energy security, effective climate change, and reduced levels of poverty due to its global implications.",2024-08-15,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,118690,,,314,,Energy Conversion and Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Biomass management challenges; CIF-DEMATEL; CIF-QFD; CIF-SWARA; Smart circular solutions; TISM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study employs Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), combined with MICMAC analysis and an extensive literature review, to develop such a model. We identified 15 key factors and analyzed their driving and dependence powers to understand their interrelationships. Most factors, such as contextual understanding, transparency, intuition, emotional intelligence, ethics, bias, tacit knowledge, creativity, credibility, and reliability, were found to be autonomous. Accountability and privacy emerged as the strongest driving forces, while trust and adaptability exhibited the highest dependence and lowest driving power. This research offers a comprehensive understanding of AI limitations and their interrelationships, providing valuable insights for managers and businesses. The findings can aid in making more informed decisions about AI implementation and in developing strategies to mitigate these limitations.

In a 2017 article, Kirchherr et al. found that the CE concept is interpreted and implemented in a variety of ways. While multiple interpretations of CE can enrich scholarly perspectives, differentiation and fragmentation can also impede consolidation of the concept. Some scholarship has discussed these trends in context-specific cases, but no large-scale, systematic study has analysed whether such consolidation has taken place across the field. This article fills this gap by analysing 221 recent CE definitions, making several notable findings. First, the concept has seen both consolidation and differentiation in the past five years. Second, definitional trends are emerging that potentially have more meaning for scholarship than for practice. Third, scholars increasingly recommend a fundamental systemic shift to enable CE, particularly within supply chains. Fourth, sustainable development is frequently considered the principal aim of CE, but questions linger about whether CE can mutually support environmental sustainability and economic development. Finally, recent studies argue that CE transition relies on a broad alliance of stakeholders, including producers, consumers, policymakers, and scholars. This study contributes an updated systematic analysis of CE definitions and conceptualizations that serves as an empirical snapshot of current scholarly thinking. It thereby provides a basis for further research on whether conceptual consolidation is needed and how it can be facilitated for practical purposes.",2023-07-01,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,107001,,,194,,"Resources, Conservation and Recycling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4R Framework; Circular economy; Content analysis; Definitions; Sustainable development; Systematic review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitantly, two emerging topics are currently gaining interest due to their potential to implement systematic shifts and contribute to achieving the SDG – Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0). This research performed a systematic literature review to identify how the CE-I4.0 nexus, the combination of CE practices and I4.0 technologies, could contribute to achieving the SDG. A total of 50 peer-review articles that addressed the simultaneous or individual link between CE and I4.0 to sustainability form the review portfolio. The articles were first screened with regard to the I4.0 technologies and CE practices applied, and further analyzed in order to understand the stronger links to the SDG. Findings show that the CE-I4.0 nexus directly benefits SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, and SDG 13. The specific targets addressed by the combined implementation of CE practices and I4.0 technologies are disclosed and discussed. We argue that the CE-I4.0 nexus is pivotal in the endeavors to reach the SDG, as it connects innovative technologies with novel circular production and business models, which ultimately brings the opportunity to tackle the SDG targets intensified in this study.

Such research work is challenging, mainly because the customer journey involves the subjectivity of customers' experience and is influenced by multiple factors. Therefore, this study proposes a deduction analysis of an interpretive structural model (ISM) to construct a correlation analysis of customer journey enablers by collecting data on tourists’ actual experiences of pilgrimage. The importance of customer journey enablers is evaluated through the analytic network process (ANP), and the characteristics of the driving power and dependence power of the enablers are classified. This research analyzes the content of religious pilgrimages, establishes 12 enablers for customer journeys, such as “quality of life”, “local security”, “social stability”, and “local friendship”, and develops four customer journey paths through ISM. The important differences in journey path enablers are analyzed by the ANP and cross-impact matrix multiplication (MICMAC) under the influence of different ISM-level contents of each customer journey path. It is hoped that the discussion of the enablers of customer journey paths in religious pilgrimages can enhance tourists' understanding of religious pilgrimages and provide a management framework for tourism departments to help tourists enjoy the experience of local religion, humanities, and the natural environment.",2023-12-01,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,200-212,,,57,,Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Analytic network process; Customer journeys; Interpretive structural model; Pilgrimage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a bid to explore the application of blockchain technology in HOM, we systematically review the current literature and deployed practices. Our review covers 64 articles that provide contributions which we categorize into four focus areas: (i) overview of blockchain in HOM, (ii) identity and personal data management, (iii) humanitarian logistics, and (iv) humanitarian communications. The majority of the articles that we surveyed focus on the potential benefits of blockchain in HOM, and the enablers and barriers to its adoption. A limited number of theoretical frameworks provide insights into how blockchain can be utilized in HOM to improve operational efficiency, promote trust, and foster collaborations among relief agencies. With the exception of a few pilot programs that have been deployed in the humanitarian setting, we find that the majority of the work addressing the use of blockchain in HOM has not yet been tested in the field, and therefore, little empirical evidence exists to prove blockchain's capabilities in HOM.

However, the lack of annotated data, automated tools, and other challenges hinder the full utilisation of NLP for EHRs. Various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and NLP techniques are studied and compared to understand the limitations and opportunities in this space comprehensively. Methodology: After screening 261 articles from 11 databases, we included 127 papers for full-text review covering seven categories of articles: (1) medical note classification, (2) clinical entity recognition, (3) text summarisation, (4) deep learning (DL) and transfer learning architecture, (5) information extraction, (6) Medical language translation and (7) other NLP applications. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Result and Discussion: EHR was the most commonly used data type among the selected articles, and the datasets were primarily unstructured. Various ML and DL methods were used, with prediction or classification being the most common application of ML or DL. The most common use cases were: the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) classification, clinical note analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) for clinical descriptions and research on psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: We find that the adopted ML models were not adequately assessed. In addition, the data imbalance problem is quite important, yet we must find techniques to address this underlining problem.

Findings Scientometric KM research has entered the maturity stage: its volume has been growing, reaching six publications per month in 2019. Scientometric KM research has become highly specialized, which explains many inconsistent findings, and the interests of scientometric KM researchers and their preferred inquiry methods have changed over time. There is a dangerous trend toward a monopoly of the scholarly publishing market which affects researchers’ behavior. To create a list of keywords for database searches, scientometric KM scholars should rely on the formal KM keyword classification schemes, and KM-centric peer-reviewed journals should continue welcoming manuscripts on scientometric topics. Practical implications Stakeholders should realize that the KM discipline may successfully exist as a cluster of divergent schools of thought under an overarching KM umbrella and that the notion of intradisciplinary cohesion and consistency should be abandoned. Journal of Knowledge Management is unanimously recognized as a leading KM journal, but KM researchers should not limit their focus to the body of knowledge documented in the KM-centric publication forums. The top six most productive countries are the USA, the UK, Taiwan, Canada, Australia and China.

It first examines the context in which Management Accounting Research was founded in 1990 and then introduces the six invited review papers. These papers cover a wide range of subjects comprising critical and social theory, managerialist studies, contingency theory, experimental behavioural research and intra-organisational management accounting. Amongst various other recommendations, some of the authors suggest that there is a need for research in management accounting to more effectively build on prior research so as to accumulate knowledge about specific issues and problems. In addition, they suggest that researchers in the different areas (or sub-disciplines) of management accounting should talk to each other more. For instance, insights and findings from qualitative research could be used to inform quantitative studies and vice versa. The later parts of this Editorial discuss opportunities and challenges for management accounting research in the future. In particular, it is pointed out that, compared to when Management Accounting Research was founded in 1990, researchers now have highly theorised understandings of management accounting practices, and one challenge is to use these understandings to try to close the ‘practice-research gap’. It is argued that management accounting theories have had a relatively limited impact on practice and, as there are increasing pressures on universities to demonstrate the impact and value of university research, some suggestions are made about ways of increasing the impact of management accounting research.",2016-06-01,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,1-9,,,31,,Management Accounting Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25 years on; History of management accounting; Impact of research; Management accounting reviews; Practice-research gap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using machine learning models in this field might be beneficial but requires some unique considerations in how organizations govern, assure, audit, and support the use of AI. While substantial work has been done on AI ethics, organizational implantation studies are rare and often anecdotal, particularly in HR. In this article, we would like to better understand the common ethical considerations and organizational responses for developing AI for HR use and how different organizations engage with them by comparing two case studies. This paper begins by reviewing AI ethical issues specific to HR and describes the common mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. After this introduction, case studies are illustrated, and the organizational responses in both cases are analyzed. The discussion section shows that although the organizations were aware of the AI ethics issues, their responses varied and depended on different governance and self-regulation mechanisms that might have impinged their ability to proactively engage with ethical issues. A second finding is that the organization used only a relatively small set of mitigation strategies proposed in the literature, and we propose several reasons for this. These insights might be important to various organizations deploying or developing AI for HR use that want better governance, assurance, and audit mechanisms to responsibly address the ethical issues raised by AI in this field.",2024-06-01,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,102527,,,77,,Technology in Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AI ethics; Ethical deliberation; HR analytics; People analytics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These factors are important to achieve success, but sustainable competitive advantage depends on a company's ability to exploit its current assets, while simultaneously exploring new ways of producing value. The ambidextrous balancing of these two areas requires concerted effort and the capacity to balance paradoxical tensions. Literature has thoroughly covered the aspect of how to overcome the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. However, research has only recently started focusing on the pivotal role that digital technologies may play in this process. Our paper contributes to this nascent literature stream by investigating how STs can operate as antecedents of structural ambidexterity. This study relies on the 3rd CINet Survey (2016–2017) involving over 370 companies worldwide. Leveraging on STs and structural ambidexterity as mediators, we used Structural Equation Modelling to show that manufacturing firms with good business performance are in a favorable position to achieve better innovation performances.

In this research, the notions of ‘meaningful information’, ‘the logic involved’, and ‘the significance and the envisaged consequences’ are analysed. Apart from a legal analysis, empirical research was carried out in 30 countries (27 EU and 3 EFTA EEA Member States), consisting of a survey amongst all Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and interviews with experts of privacy organisations. Several types of potentially meaningful information that could be in scope of right of access requests were assessed, as well as several types of information on the consequences for data subjects.

International publicly funded agricultural research for development will play an increasingly vital role in support of such goals as reducing poverty, improving food and nutrition security, and improving natural resources and ecosystem services. Here we take stock of the work over the last decade of CGIAR, one of the major players in the agricultural research for development arena, from the perspective of published, peer-reviewed science. We do this with respect to several elements of its vision as set out in 2011, elements that are shared by many other organisations that are also working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, we found a strong association between number of CGIAR publications and countries with large numbers of rural poor and high child stunting prevalence. At the same time several countries were identified that are anomalous, being either relatively over- or under-represented in the peer-reviewed literature in relation to numbers of rural poor and stunting prevalence. On average, 30% of the calories consumed in national food baskets come from food sources that are not currently the commodity focus of CGIAR research, such as fruit and vegetables.

However, lack of skilled personnel, cost of testing automation, and maintenance of script along with others oppose the widespread adoption of automation in testing. The work proposed by this study is in line with the development of Systematic Process Improvement Model for Testing Automation, abbreviated as SPIM-TA. The model is inspired from Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Software Outsourcing Vendor Readiness Model (SOVRM) maturity-level-based framework. The research was done based on a four-phased methodology. In the first phase, a systematic literature review identified 14 critical challenges in software testing automation with practices or solutions for each of these challenges. In the second round, a survey questionnaire is used to validate these findings in industrial context and extract more practical insights from case studies. This dual approach had ensured both academic rigor and the relevance of the practices with industry. The third one involved developing SPIM-TA by incorporating insights that come from the SLR and those results of the survey as well. The framework defines five maturity levels, systematically addressing the identified challenges and providing a structured pathway for organizations to enhance their automation processes. In the fourth phase, case studies of industrial applications were carried out to evaluate SPIM-TA’s efficiency. The applicability, scalability, and impact of the framework on testing automation in the real world were assessed using the Motorola Assessment Tool. The findings illustrate the systematic way SPIM-TA will help overcome the automation challenge, so that organizations can reach more advanced levels of maturity and efficiency in their testing processes.

The board and executive management are tasked with ensuring proper governance of organizations, which should in the end contribute to a sense of assurance. Assurance is understood to be a part of corporate governance which provides stakeholders with confidence in a subject matter by evaluating evidence about that subject matter. Evidence will include proof that proper controls and structures are in place, that risks are managed and that compliance with internal and external requirements is demonstrated with regard to the subject matter. Decisions regarding the use of cloud computing in organizations bring these responsibilities to the fore. Design/methodology/approach The design of this paper is based on an extensive review of literature, predominantly best practices and standards, from the fields covering IT governance, cloud computing and assurance. Findings The results from this paper can be used to formulate cloud computing assurance evidence statements, as part of IT governance mandates. Originality/value This paper aims to add value by highlighting the responsibility of managers to ensure assurance when exploiting opportunities presented through IT advances, such as cloud computing; serving to inform management about the advances that have and are being made in the field of cloud computing guidelines; and motivating that these guidelines be used for assurance on behalf of organizations adopting and using cloud computing.",2017-03-13,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,26-46,,1,25,,Information and Computer Security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cloud computing assurance; Cloud computing compliance; Cloud computing guidelines; Cloud computing standards; Governance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cities are multi-layered deposits of tangible historic features and intangible meanings, memories, practices and associated values. These dense socio-material assemblages have been conceptualised as the ‘deep city’, a concept that recognises dynamic relationships between past, present and future, whilst simultaneously repositioning heritage at the heart of sustainable transformation. However, methods for understanding people’s relationships with urban heritage are mostly applied piecemeal in urban planning and heritage management. Here, we introduce research involving a suite of social and digital research methods, which can be deployed rapidly in online and offline spaces to examine the social values generated by urban heritage. Three in-depth case studies, in Edinburgh, London, and Florence, reveal how these values are involved in urban place-making.

We call the social-purpose-driven ecosystem a phenomenon which seeks social impact before profits and aims to empower citizens for individual and collective well-being. Thus, capturing value from digital platforms embedded in a social-purpose-driven ecosystem fundamentally differs from profiting from purely commercial digital platforms and poses significant challenges to platform owners and public policy. Previous research has focused mainly on profiting from technological innovations but has yet to consider the contextual role of the social-purpose-driven ecosystem. We applied the Profiting from Innovation (PFI) framework to fill this gap. Furthermore, based on the results of the multiple-case study of five European digital healthcare platforms, we extend the PFI framework. As a result, we define four unique contingencies which enable value capture from digital healthcare platforms embedded in a social-purpose-driven ecosystem: 1) multilayer value creation, (2) multipurpose complementary assets, (3) emerging dominant design, and (4) distributed socio-economic returns mechanisms. The study offers two managerial and policy contributions. First, it calls on platform owners and policymakers to acknowledge the contextual effect of a social-purpose-driven ecosystem.

The findings are considered important foundations for designing a place branding measurement system, which is the next step and final purpose of the author’s research project. Design/methodology/approach A total of 12 international academic experts from eight countries (in four continents) were individually interviewed. A semi-structured individual interview was applied as a research method. Sampling was purposive and the respondents represented the fields of marketing, place branding and public management. The standardized set of 19 open-ended questions was categorized into four themes (city brand effectiveness, methodology, measurement process and indicators). Findings The measurement of effectiveness of city branding should be treated as a strategic endeavor; however, it is a complex issue where political, social and methodological challenges overlap. Barriers to the development of a well-functioning measurement system include: too narrow understanding of what brand is, lack of knowledge or culture of measurement, conflicting political interests, reluctance to involve internal stakeholders, insufficient funding and complexity of the brand itself. The reliable measurement system should be characterized by attributes such as simplicity and durability, stakeholder inclusion, political rationale, adjustment to the specificity of the city and the independence of the measuring body/institution. Originality/value Up-to-date, common standards or universal measurement frames of the place branding measurement system do not exist. No discussion can be found in the literature on how such a system should be designed and implemented.

Design/methodology/approach This study collected the COVID-19-related questions posted on a Chinese social Q&A website for a period of 90 days since the pandemic outbreak in China. A qualitative thematic approach was applied to analyze the 1,681 valid questions using an open coding process. Findings A taxonomy of information need topics for a health crisis context that identifies 8 main categories and 33 subcategories was developed, from which four overarching themes were extracted. These include understanding, clarification and preparation; affection expression of worries and confidence; coping with a challenging situation and resuming normal life; and social roles in the pandemic. The authors discussed the differences between a health crisis and a normal health context shaping information needs. Finally, a conceptual framework was developed to illustrate the typology, nature and triggers of health crisis information needs. Research limitations/implications First, only the Baidu Zhidao platform was investigated, and caution is advised before assuming the generalizability of the results, as the questioners of Baidu Zhidao are not representative of the whole population. Furthermore, since at the time of writing the COVID-19 is still in an emerging and evolving situation (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020), the collected data included only a relatively small sample size compared to the post-pandemic period, and this might have impact on the interpretation of the study’s findings. Practical implications The study’s taxonomy of information needs provides a reference for indexing and organizing related information during a disaster.

A comparative analysis of the approach of the EU and APEC to cross border data transfers and protection of personal data in the IoT era,Computer Law & Security Review,,2212-473X,10.1016/j.clsr.2019.05.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026736491930038X,"This article examines the two major international data transfer schemes in existence today – the European Union (EU) model which at present is effectively the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules system (CBPR), in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). While IoT data ostensibly relates to things i.e. products and services, it impacts individuals and their data protection and privacy rights, and raises compliance issues for corporations especially in relation to international data flows. The GDPR regulates the processing of personal data of individuals who are EU data subjects including cross border data transfers. As an EU Regulation, the GDPR applies directly as law to EU member nations. The GDPR also has extensive extraterritorial provisions that apply to processing of personal data outside the EU regardless of place of incorporation and geographical area of operation of the data controller/ processor. There are a number of ways that the GDPR enables lawful international transfer of personal data including schemes that are broadly similar to APEC CBPR. APEC CBPR is the other major regional framework regulating transfer of personal data between APEC member nations. It is essentially a voluntary accountability scheme that initially requires acceptance at country level, followed by independent certification by an accountability agent of the organization wishing to join the scheme. APEC CBPR is viewed by many in the United States of America (US) as preferable to the EU approach because CBPR is considered more conducive to business than its counterpart schemes under the GDPR, and therefore is regarded as the scheme most likely to prevail. While there are broad areas of similarity between the EU and APEC approaches to data protection in the context of cross border data transfer, there are also substantial differences. This paper considers the similarities and major differences, and the overall suitability of the two models for the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) in which large amounts of personal data are processed on an on-going basis from connected devices around the world. This is the first time the APEC and GDPR cross-border data schemes have been compared in this way. The paper concludes with the author expressing a view as to which scheme is likely to set the global standard.",2019-08-01,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,380-397,,4,35,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CBPR; data protection; GDPR; global standard; IoT data; privacy; transborder data flows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is evident in the cybersecurity sector, where ML has wide-ranging applications, such as identifying and blocking threats, uncovering unusual software and user behaviour, and many others. However, the increase in successful cyberattacks demonstrates that the effectiveness of ML in cybersecurity applications can be questioned. Although the attacks may be new, ML is often adopted due to its ability to handle diverse and often unforeseen situations – a capability that is not possible using traditional rule-based security mechanisms. As both the rate of attacks and adoption of ML solutions are increasing, there is a need to determine whether ML-based security solutions are meeting the expectations of businesses and whether businesses are genuinely aware of the ML capabilities and limitations. Moreover, current literature shows a significant variation in how ML solutions are evaluated in cybersecurity applications, which might result in a poor understanding of ML capabilities. This paper explores the common perceptions and observations of decision-makers and specialists using ML for cybersecurity regarding its capabilities, implementation, evaluation, and communication. A semi-structured interview is conducted with individuals in various managerial positions to perform this investigation.

A gap that the study addresses is the theoretical perspectives on SR in the context of SDG. Then we conduct a bibliometric and science mapping analysis of research trends on SR and precisely map SR research to SDGs which is also a gap in the current literature. We find an exponential increase in the number of publications and citations on SR, particularly after 2015, which coincides with increased public awareness and scrutiny of the SDGs. At the country level, Australia leads with a total of 13 SDGs, followed by the UK, Spain, and Italy, which each address 12 SDGs. Emerging economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and India have also increased their contributions since 2019. A keyword co-occurrence analysis identified three main clusters: stakeholder engagement, corporate governance, and accountability; sustainable development goals and climate change; and sustainability reporting and global reporting initiatives. All three clusters had highly cited publications related to SDG 8 (decent work), SDG 9 (industry innovation), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption). This highlights the interdisciplinary nature of SR and its relevance to multiple SDGs. The study is distinctive in that we utilized social network analysis to examine the SDG network based on SR publications, which also affirmed the centrality of SDG 9 and 12.

China must urgently develop an appropriate approach to balancing these two conflicting interests. However, there is currently no coherent and uniform regime governing the protection of employees’ personal information in China. The primary legal source on which employers can rely is the latest version of the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which offers three lawful bases for employers’ processing of their employees’ personal information. These bases are employee consent; “necessity for the conclusion or performance of an employment contract”; and “necessity for conducting human resource management.” Concerns have been expressed regarding the reasonableness and effectiveness of the three lawful bases under the PIPL. First, it is both legally and practically problematic for the PIPL to rely so heavily on employee consent. Second, it is unclear whether the other two lawful bases relieve employers of the duty of notification and, if so, how to safeguard employees’ right to know. Third, the ambiguous standard of “necessity” requires clarification. This article argues that China should adopt many elements from EU law, while US law should be only followed in relation to the standard of “necessity”. In relation to employee consent, the EU approach is preferable to the US approach. As the EU approach does not generally regard employees’ consent as a lawful basis for the processing of their information and uses the other two lawful bases as alternatives to employee consent, this approach better reflects the customary practices of employee subordination and employer control in China. In contrast, US law deems employee consent to be an absolute general defense to the tort of privacy violation and adopts an employer favoritism approach to balancing these two conflicting interests, which is not appropriate in the Chinese context. In relation to the scope of necessity, three tests taken from the EU and US approaches should be considered by the Chinese courts. In addition, when processing personal information based on the other two lawful bases, employers should safeguard employees’ right to know through collective contracts concluded with labor unions or employee representatives under the Chinese Labor Contract Law, which would effectively address employers’ arbitrariness. Ultimately, these changes would produce a better balance between employees’ right to privacy in terms of their personal information and employers’ need to subordinate and control employees.",2023-09-01,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,105853,,,50,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chinese personal information protection law; Employee consent; Employer's right to human resource management; Personal information protection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides the generic architecture description, the paper also presents the first MiCADO reference implementation, and explains how the scalability of the Data Avenue service that is applied for data transfer in WS-PGRADE/gUSE based science gateways, can be improved. Performance evaluation of the implemented scalability based on up and downscaling experiments is presented.",2019-05-01,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,937-946,,,94,,Future Generation Computer Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Automated scalability; Cloud orchestration; Data Avenue; Science gateway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It finds that the safeguards for decisions based solely on automated data processing provided by the GDPR coincide with or serve a comparable function to traditional administrative due process elements such as the duty to give reasons, the duty of care principle, and the right to a hearing. The automation of decision-making by public authorities across the EU will therefore be regulated by an overlap of national administrative procedures and the GDPR. This overlap, however, leads to a paradoxical problem: on the one hand, the GDPR is an inflexible legal instrument aimed at setting out in detail the rights of data subjects and the obligations of data controllers, and it does not offer national legislators much room to align its terms with national administrative procedures. On the other, the GDPR's broad language makes it susceptible to interpretations embedded in the elaborated practices of the national administrations. The unclear relationship between national administrative procedures and the GDPR may undermine its main purpose – to establish an equal level of protection in all EU Member States through its ‘consistent and homogenous application’. After outlining the main challenges in this regard, the article concludes with a call for further research and regulatory frameworks adjustments aimed at developing a better governance regime for automated administrative decision-making that would allow for embracing technological progress while keeping threats to individual rights in check.",2021-07-01,2025-10-16 11:51:43,2025-10-16 11:51:43,,105538,,,41,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Administration; Article 22; Automated decision-making; Due process; GDPR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by identifying descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages. Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study's findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0.

In this study, we explored the spatial spillover influence of infrastructure network on urbanization in road network-based and POI-based hypotheses through spatial modeling in Wuhan urban agglomeration in 2005 and 2015. The global integration values of the road axial lines and Points of Interest (POI) density were used to generate spatial weight matrices by the gravity model to formulate the two hypotheses. The results revealed that local economic factors and the spatial influence of infrastructure both contribute to the changes in urbanization with varying powers in different hypotheses and years. In general, spatial spillover effects from neighbors in the form of road network and point-based facilities have weakened in recent years. However, the comparative magnitude has changed from road network dominated to similar functioning between road network and POI based facilities. It is concluded that the rational utilization of the embedded spatial spillover effect helps to formulate strategies for sustainable urbanization in improving resource use efficiency, achieving balanced development and promoting an integrated urban–rural development.",2019-05-01,2025-10-16 11:52:11,2025-10-16 11:52:11,,101476,,,47,,Sustainable Cities and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Infrastructure construction; POI; Road network; Spatial spillover effect; Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While successful elements of the 20th century policy approach need still to be applied in the developing world, two significant flaws are now apparent within its core thinking. It assumes that continuing economic growth will generate sufficient wealth to pay for the public health infrastructure and improvement needed in the 21st century when, in reality, externalised costs are spiralling. Secondly, there is evidence of growing mismatch between ecosystems and human progress. While 20th century development has undeniably improved public health, it has also undermined the capacity to maintain life on a sustainable basis and has generated other more negative health consequences. For these and other reasons a rethink about the role, purpose and direction of public health is needed. While health has to be at the heart of any viable notion of progress the dominant policy path offers new versions of the ‘health follows wealth’ position.

To deal with uncertainty in the evaluation process, fuzzy theory is integrated into the model. To establish the house of quality matrix, technology-based stakeholders' requirements were identified and classified in four dimensions: economic and financial, technology adoption, sustainability, competencies. Moreover, nine supplier criteria were assumed. Based on expert evaluations, the results suggest that financial credit and supplier collaboration are the most prominent attributes to evaluate suppliers, while environmental commitment is sorted as the least important criterion.

It makes a case for diversity, including a broad range of theories and research methodologies, as a defining feature of AAAJ. As we have done since 1988 in AAAJ’s first editorial, we continue to urge interdisciplinary accounting researchers to undertake innovative research and be both original and creative, avoiding the narrow focus and detachment from society that is characteristic of globally pervasive North American economics-based accounting research. Design/methodology/approach The paper employs an analysis and critique of trends in interdisciplinary research, drawing upon the previous 29 editorials/commentaries published in AAAJ. It also elucidates the field of scholarship associated with AAAJ in 2016 as evidence of the patterning of recent research and publishing trends. Findings This paper identifies challenges confronting interdisciplinary researchers in the globalised academic community. These include our obsession with theoretical engorgement and our adversarial rather than cooperative approach to knowledge development. Furthermore, the authors argue that researchers must reflect on their motivation, informing theories and values if they intend to contribute to practice, policy and a wider societal good. Accounting researchers have a responsibility to go beyond observation, engaging in and constructing a more equal and fair society.

This study uses a form of topic modelling to analyse literature exploring AI and related techniques in an accounting context. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been used to enable probabilistic, machine-based interrogation of large volumes of literature. This study applies LDA to the abstracts of 930 peer-reviewed academic publications from a variety of disciplines to identify the most significant accounting and AI topics discussed in the literature during the period 1990 to 2023.

The PRC's civil law has evolved from the traditional monism of privacy right provision (protecting personal information) to the dualism of separating privacy protection and personal information protection. But when the private information within the privacy sphere involves personal information, the dualism protection is not absolute, but more delicate than it has been suggested. More importantly, there is little in the existing literature analysing the noteworthy divergence of the protection path of privacy and personal information in civil law and criminal law – or considering the reasonable convergence of the protection path under the civil and criminal law. China's Criminal Law has sought to protect privacy with personal information provision for more than a decade. But it is presently difficult to convert privacy content into private information for personal information protection purposes. Given the multifaceted forms of contemporary privacy invasion and comparative law trends and thoughts, we seek to build a protection framework for privacy in the information age under the criminal law – and continually updating it – so as to make use of the expression function of coherence law theory to nurture a culture of respecting individual privacy and trusting legal protection in the information technology environment. The eventual convergence of dualism protection of personal data and privacy in both civil law and criminal law corresponds to the doctrinal coherence in the information age and to policy considerations in the digital economy and society. Privacy is by default an inalienable right to protect dignity and liberty – while personal information can be a comprehensive interest, which values and balances security and purpose, in accordance with law, in a specific jurisdiction such as contemporary China.

Output is production value and inputs are expenses on land, labor, and other inputs. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) measures are used to capture technological progress via efficiency analysis. Filtering the data with a moving average and fractional regression we identify four periods with distinct behavior of technical efficiency under constant or decreasing returns to scale. From 1976 to 1988 and from 1996 to 2007 technical efficiency decreases at statistically significant rates of −1.74% and −0.26% respectively. From 1989 to 1995 and from 2008 to 2016 efficiency increases at statistically significant rates of 1.53% and 1.75% respectively. Efficiency of input use varies in these periods and is computed as a byproduct of the DEA analysis. We observe a more efficient usage of land and other inputs. A parametric fit using adjusted efficient inputs indicate the relative elasticities of 40.5%, 38.5% and 21.0% for other inputs, land and labor, respectively.

The application of MFA in e-waste management has recently increased and quite a few academic articles have been published on this issue providing decision support at the policy level. However, there is a need to understand the dynamics of MFA methodology, the data requirements (as well as the data sources used in the previous studies) and the lessons learnt from the studies, so that countries where such an E-waste-MFA study has not yet been performed can apply the international experience of such an emerging research technique. This comprehensive review article presents the recent applications, trends, characteristics, research gaps and challenges of the MFA method that may help e-waste management with an overview of the need for a such tool to be applied.

However, many organizations still struggle to articulate the necessary AI, and AI experts have difficulties understanding the problems faced by these organizations. This knowledge gap makes it difficult for organizations to identify the technical requirements, such as necessary data and algorithms, for adopting AI. To overcome this problem, we propose a new AI system architecture design methodology based on the IMO (Input-AI Model-Output) structure. The IMO structure enables effective identification of the technical requirements necessary to develop real AI models. While previous research has identified the importance and challenges of technical requirements, such as data and AI algorithms, for AI adoption, there has been little research on methodology to concretize them. Our methodology is composed of three stages: problem definition, system AI solution, and AI technical solution to design the AI technology and requirements that organizations need at a system level. The effectiveness of our methodology is demonstrated through a case study, logical comparative analysis with other studies, and experts reviews, which demonstrate that our methodology can support successful AI adoption to organizations.",2024-03-01,2025-10-16 11:52:11,2025-10-16 11:52:11,,102264,,,150,,Data & Knowledge Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AI adoption; AI system architecture design; AI(Artificial intelligence); Requirements engineering; System engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the rising global SC failure costs and risks associated with this initiative (owing to unique geopolitical, economic and mega-connectivity involving over 70 countries) necessitate examining BRI SC risks. Yet, research on the subject remains limited, and the purpose of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge. Design/methodology/approach A two-pronged approach was taken. First, a data sample of 554 articles was analyzed and 178 articles found relevant were used to present a systematic, structured framework of risk factors along operational, economic, financial, social and security dimensions. Then informed by the theory of risk management and supplemented by literature evidence, we have built a BRI SC risk model. Findings The results presented through the model show that BRI SCs face a combination of risks triggered by operational processes, informational and environmental (PIE) deficiencies. Findings show that lack of risk and liability management, unbalanced risk-sharing partnerships, lack of transparency, inadequate project evaluation, incompatible corporate governance structures and cyber security all pose threats to BRI SCs specifically and SCs in general. Research limitations/implications Academically, the results facilitate theory development by identifying and proposing seven risk factors and modeling relationship among them and BRI SC risks outcome. The results also extend application of theory of risk management to SC context. Practical implications The findings provide a decision-making tool for managers to assess risk factors in their SCs, thus enabling improved decision making to avoid, mitigate, transfer or accept risks.

Nevertheless, the water sector has been claimed to be less innovative than other sectors. This Special Volume on the dynamics of water innovation is based on the realization that, in general, there is a striking absence of academic studies on the dynamics of water innovation. This SV is therefore designed to lay the foundations for the field of water innovation studies, in an effort to integrate the emerging insights. Together, the contributions in this SV capture the current understanding of the dynamics of water innovation and provide insights into how the water innovation process can be fostered. The purpose of this introductory article is threefold, namely to frame the discussion on water innovation dynamics in order to contextualise the contributions of this SV, to provide systematic guidance for studying water innovation dynamics and to suggest the way forward for water innovation studies. It captures the extent of the field of water innovation studies with a review of the literature of the last three decades and frames water innovations. Based on five decades of innovation research and drawing on three areas (management, strategy and policy), we provide an innovation studies taxonomy that consists of four organising dimensions: type of innovation, stage of innovation, level of analysis and measurement. This taxonomy enables researchers to study the dynamics of water innovation from different combinations of conceptual and thematic angles, drawing on the field of innovation studies in a systematic fashion.

Often unknowingly, people deliver up commercially-valuable personal information as a condition of online user experience, functionality and access. Websites are increasingly tracking user behaviours for commercial purposes and social media derives its income largely from data collection and advertising targeted to the personal disclosures and behavioural attributes which are its data-production mainstay. In this context, consumers face a plethora of information collection practices, all designed to generate data analytics including inferential and predictive profiling to create a ‘digital identity’ for OBA purposes. In this subterranean exchange, consumers are economically redefined as data subjects and advertising targets; a reframing which is perhaps why the OBA industry faces a crisis in consumer concern, both as to privacy and trust. This paper proposes that the regulatory control of OBA in Australia is in disarray. Consumer ignorance of online privacy management and OBA practices is demonstrable. Industry transparency, disclosure, consent processes and compliance practices are questionable. Regulator interest is minimal, industry self-regulation is weak and consumer technical ability and personal responsibility is a last fragile line of defence. Data breaches are ubiquitous in a crowded and poorly-audited supply chain, and entail significant adverse consumer consequences. Yet despite these serious concerns, Australian regulators are failing to respond to OBA issues, either through mandating greater industry disclosure or through regulatory action. The author seeks to expose these weaknesses in calling for consumer and privacy regulators to take more meaningful action to better protect consumers' interests online.",2016-02-01,2025-10-16 11:52:11,2025-10-16 11:52:11,,55-90,,1,32,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Australia; Misleading and deceptive conduct; Online advertising; Online behavioural advertising; Privacy; Unconscionable conduct; Unfair contract terms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, attaining truly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness of all processes and actors that are part of the system’s life cycle, and considers previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision contemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and requirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement for trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be implemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement trustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of AI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a responsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a concept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes, subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our multidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the diverging views published lately about the future of AI.

HSMs are essential for safeguarding sensitive data, enabling secure communication, and maintaining the integrity of operations within smart grids and renewable energy infrastructures, which are increasingly susceptible to cyber threats. Despite the growing relevance of HSMs in this domain, there remains a significant gap in the academic literature concerning their specific adoption and optimization in sustainable energy contexts. This paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the role and integration of HSMs in sustainable energy systems. It examines how HSMs enhance system security through advanced cryptographic protections, operational robustness, and secure data exchange. The study further explores key optimization strategies, such as energy-efficient circuit design, advanced process technologies, and duty-cycling mechanisms that align HSM functionality with energy sustainability goals. Additionally, the paper identifies and discusses major challenges affecting HSM deployment, such as cost constraints, energy consumption, and interoperability with legacy infrastructure. By synthesizing these findings, the paper unveils the strategic implementation of HSMs in sustainable energy frameworks and lays a foundation for future empirical investigations aimed at validating and extending the discussed approaches.",2025-09-01,2025-10-16 11:52:11,2025-10-16 11:52:11,,100791,,,50,,International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Communication; Cyberattack; Energy; Hardware security module; Sustainable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When implementing recent reform of data protection law, the European Union decided to further strengthen guarantees of the protection of privacy in cyberspace. At the same time, however, it faced the practical problem of how to ensure compliance with these principles in relation to third countries. The approach proposed in the GDPR, which is based on a newly-defined territorial scope of application, clearly indicates an attempt to apply EU rules extraterritorially in relation to data processors in third countries. Irrespective of EU activity, the United States has also introduced its own regulations addressing the same problem. An example is the federal law adopted in 2018, specifying how to execute national court orders for the transfer of electronic data. The CLOUD Act was established in response to legal doubts raised in the Microsoft v United States case regarding the transfer of electronic data stored in the cloud by US obliged entities to law enforcement authorities, as well as in cases where this data is physically located in another country and its transfer could result in violating the legal norms of a foreign jurisdiction. The CLOUD Act also facilitates bilateral international agreements that enable the cross-border transfer of e-evidence for the purposes of ongoing criminal proceedings. Both the content of the new regulations and the model proposed by the US legislature for future agreements concluded on the basis of the CLOUD Act can be seen as an alternative to regulations arising from EU law. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the CLOUD Act and CLOUD Act Agreements from the perspective of EU law and, in particular, attempt to answer the question as to whether this new legal mechanism brings the EU and the USA closer to finding common ground with regard to a coherent model of exchange and protection of personal data.",2020-09-01,2025-10-16 11:52:11,2025-10-16 11:52:11,,105442,,,38,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CLOUD Act; Cross-border data flow; Data protection; E-evidence; GDPR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, information ecology refers to the interaction and co-evolution of technologies, human beings and the social environment. Design/methodology/approach The data consist of 25 thematic interviews conducted in a public Finnish organisation responsible for organising welfare services, and in its collaborating organisations. The interviews were analysed qualitatively. The analytical framework is based on Nardi and O'Day's five components of information ecology: system, diversity, co-evolution, keystone species and locality. Findings The analysis shows that these basic components still exist in the digitalisation era, but that they should be interpreted and highlighted differently, for example, stressing the openness of the information system instead of closed systems, as well as emphasising the increasing meaning of diversity amongst digitalisation, and the dynamic co-evolution between the elements of the system. New capabilities, such as the ability to combine various kinds of information and knowledge, are needed in this adaptation.

The benefits for comfort and productivity of good indoor air quality (IAQ) conditions in hospitals are an essential need. However, minimal attention has been paid to the review of the development of IoT-based sensory technology for proper IAQ in hospital facilities. Therefore, this study provided classification taxonomy for IoT-enabled IAQ systems and a systematic review of works concerning that classification to address the ambiguity in such trends. To this end, this study checked five databases: ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. A total of 926 papers from 2016 to 2021 were collected, and the retrieved articles were filtered in accordance with the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria to obtain the final set of 27 articles.

This process, however, is quietly creating urban migration patterns that are altering the demographic profile of cities with cumulative change that we cannot fully estimate at this stage. There is growing need for a granular analysis at the parcel level to refocus the spotlight on this quiet displacement force. To start filling this lacuna, the article links privatization processes to gentrification and displacement. Through a case study of the privatization of Mitchell Lama buildings on Roosevelt Island, NYC, and the demographic changes it has engendered, this study points to a more significant trend of privatization of housing projects in American cities and worldwide. Its main argument is that, despite their quiet nature, which differs fundamentally from the Urban Renewal projects of the 1960s, the cumulative change they produce may be similar. On this basis, this study's main contribution is an in-depth, small-scale analysis aimed at deciphering the mechanisms, motivations, and decision-making processes of households experiencing ongoing privatization. Through a combination of ethnographic fieldwork, urban historical research, and statistical analysis, the study identifies three urban trends: 1. Privatization may lead to exclusionary displacement through increases in rent and cost of living; 2. Privatization may lead to social displacement pressures such as a sense of loss of place, loss of friends and community, and resentment among long-term residents; and 3. If the right policies are developed, privatization can present an opportunity for upward social mobility.",2022-09-01,2025-10-16 11:52:11,2025-10-16 11:52:11,,285-297,,3,11,,Journal of Urban Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Affordable housing; Displacement; Gentrification; New York; Privatization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we aim to tackle this issue by conducting a state-of-the-art study into organisational cyber security culture research. This work investigates four questions, including how cyber security culture is defined, what factors are essential to building and maintaining such a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a security culture and the metrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA systematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research articles from the last 10 years (2010-2020). Our findings demonstrate that while there have been notable changes in the use of terms (e.g., information security culture and cyber security culture), many of the most influential factors are similar. Top management support, policy and procedures, and awareness for instance, are critical in engendering cyber security culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed revealed common foundations, with organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting appropriate cyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used tool to measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to whether more dynamic measures are needed. For practitioners, this article highlights factors and models essential to the creation and management of a robust security culture.

However, its adoption by healthcare organizations has been accompanied by diverse challenges that could impede its meaningful use. Decisions about its adoption should be made after serious consideration of relevant industry-specific factors. Whereas the literature has focused on cloud computing adoption in general, the industrial specificities that influence the decision to adopt cloud computing in the healthcare context have yet to be systematically addressed. We reviewed empirical studies on both information systems and medical informatics to investigate the determinant factors of the cloud computing adoption decision in healthcare organizations and the industrial specificities of those factors. Based on the results of our review, we proposed a conceptual framework of cloud computing adoption studies in healthcare and made seven recommendations for related future research.

A conceptual structure is necessary in order to place in context the findings of our keyword analysis. Towards this we first present a classification scheme that relies on keywords that appeared in articles published in important OR/MS journals from 1990–2019 (over 82,000 articles). Our classification scheme applies a methodological approach towards keyword selection and its systematic classification, wherein approximately 1300 most frequently used keywords (in terms of cumulative percentage, these keywords and their derivations account for more than 45% of the approx. 290,000 keyword occurrences used by the authors to represent the content of their articles) were selected and organised in a classification scheme with seven top-level categories and multiple levels of sub-categories. The scheme identified the most commonly used keywords relating to OR/MS problems, modeling techniques and applications. Next, we use this proposed scheme to present an analysis of the last 30 years, in three distinct time periods, to show the changes in OR/MS literature.

While up to about 10 years ago, non-market valuation and cost-benefit analysis, natural resource economics, and environmental policy instruments represented the lion's share of articles published in the journal, more recently we observe a significant shift towards a more diversified array of research areas, with climate change and energy issues finding their way into the journal. In addition, increasing methodological plurality becomes apparent, reflected in a significant shift away from economic theory and towards empirical approaches. We also analyze key distinctions between the major environmental economics journals. Finally, we analyze JEEM's external influence on leading general economics (A+) journals. We find that A+ citations are positively correlated with a focus on climate change economics, market-based environmental policies and policy comparisons, the use of econometric and statistical methods or experimental approaches, and negatively correlated with a focus on water pollution and other pollutants such as pesticides.",2018-11-01,2025-10-16 11:52:11,2025-10-16 11:52:11,,433-464,,,92,,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Citation impacts; Environmental economics journals; Environmental economics research issues; Research trends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data exfiltration can be perpetrated by an outsider or an insider of an organization. Given the increasing number of data exfiltration incidents, a large number of data exfiltration countermeasures have been developed. These countermeasures aim to detect, prevent, or investigate exfiltration of sensitive or private data. With the growing interest in data exfiltration, it is important to review data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures to support future research in this field. Objective This paper is aimed at identifying and critically analysing data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures for reporting the status of the art and determining gaps for future research. Method We have followed a structured process for selecting 108 papers from seven publication databases. Thematic analysis method has been applied to analyse the extracted data from the reviewed papers. Results We have developed a classification of (1) data exfiltration attack vectors used by external attackers and (2) the countermeasures in the face of external attacks. We have mapped the countermeasures to attack vectors. Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of various countermeasures for different states of data (i.e., in use, in transit, or at rest). Conclusion This review has revealed that (a) most of the state of the art is focussed on preventive and detective countermeasures and significant research is required on developing investigative countermeasures that are equally important; (b) Several data exfiltration countermeasures are not able to respond in real-time, which specifies that research efforts need to be invested to enable them to respond in real-time (c) A number of data exfiltration countermeasures do not take privacy and ethical concerns into consideration, which may become an obstacle in their full adoption (d) Existing research is primarily focussed on protecting data in ‘in use’ state, therefore, future research needs to be directed towards securing data in ‘in rest’ and ‘in transit’ states (e) There is no standard or framework for evaluation of data exfiltration countermeasures.

Given the complex and mixed accounts of the results, questions have been raised on how large-scale digitalization programs are governed to reach health policy goals of quality improvement and equal access along with necessary digital transformations. In this qualitative systematic review, we investigate the following question: How is governance implemented and considered in the studies included in the qualitative review? Objective The aim of this study is to arrive at informed and recognizable conceptualizations and considerations of models of governance connected to eHealth, as presented and discussed in the scientific literature. In turn, we hope our results will help inform the discussion of how to govern such processes to obtain collectively negotiated objectives. Methods A qualitative systematic review is a method for integrating or comparing with the findings from qualitative studies. It looks for “themes” or “constructs” that lie in or across individual qualitative studies. This type of review produces a narrative synthesis with thematic analysis and includes interpretive conceptual models. The goal is an interpretation and broadens the understanding of a particular phenomenon. We searched the PubMed database using predefined search terms and selected papers published from 2010 onwards. We specified the criteria for selection and quality assessment. Results The search returned 220 papers. We selected 44 abstracts for full-text reading, and 11 papers were included for full-text synthesis. On the basis of the 11 papers, we constructed four governance models to categorize and conceptualize the findings. The models are political governance, normally depicting top-down processes; medical governance, which normally depicts bottom-up processes; the internet and global model, emphasizing international business strategies coupled with the internet; self-governance, which builds upon the development of the internet and Internet of Things, which has paved the way for personal governance and communication of one’s own health data.

Past research has highlighted a gap between theoretical research developments, applications and the methods most frequently used in organisations. The scope of OR applications has also been contested with arguments as to the expanding boundaries of OR. But despite this, anecdotal evidence suggests that OR has become marginalised in many contexts. In order to understand these changes, IFORS (International Federation of OR Societies) in 2009 sponsored a survey of global OR practice. The aim was to provide current evidence on the usage of OR tools, areas of application, and the barriers to OR's uptake, as well as the educational background of OR practitioners. Results presented here show practitioners falling into three segments, which can be loosely characterised as those practicing ‘traditional’ OR, those adopting a range of softer techniques including Problem Structuring Methods (PSMs), and a Business Analytics cluster. When combined with other recent survey evidence, the use of PSMs and Business Analytics is apparently extending the scope of OR practice. In particular, the paper considers whether the Business Analytics movement, with an overlapping skill set to traditional OR but with a fast growing organisational base, offers a route to diminishing the gap between academic research and practice. The paper concludes with an exploration of whether this represents not just an opportunity for OR but also a serious challenge to its established practices.",2015-08-16,2025-10-16 11:52:12,2025-10-16 11:52:12,,1-13,,1,245,,European Journal of Operational Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Analytics; Barriers to OR; OR practice; OR skills; Problem structuring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research question This systematic review aimed to examine the published literature on the safety and complication rates of day-case LD. Secondary outcome measures, including the economic impact and patient satisfaction of day-case LD, were also examined. Materials and methods A systematic electronic search was carried out on PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library between 1999 and January 2022. Studies were screened against predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria with the quality of included studies subsequently being assessed. Results In total, 15 studies were included in this review.

Emerging technologies have entered the gamut of resources which firms need to actively forecast and manage for competitive advantage. This study explored the idea of competitive advantage in the context of health insurance firms and how emerging technologies can augment existing capabilities towards this goal. The critical nature of health insurance as a social necessity and the application of emerging technologies in healthcare justified the need to theoretically establish what competencies were required for health insurance firms for technology driven competitive advantage. A qualitative method using modified Delphi technique in sequential combination to 43 in-depth expert interviews was used to explicate the factors. Data was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative content and thematic intensity analysis. Organizational people orientation and service delivery capabilities emerged as foundations of a contemporary competitive advantage framework for health insurance firms supported by technical expertise, knowledge management practices and product innovation strategies. Results indicated that management of emerging technologies exerted a gravitational effect on firm competencies to create a contemporary competitive advantage framework.

In this context, a range of literature has reported on developments regarding the implementation of new digital technologies for COVID-19–related surveillance, prevention, and control. Objective In this study, scoping reviews of academic and nonacademic literature were undertaken to obtain an overview of the evidence regarding digital innovations implemented to address key public health functions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to expand on the work of existing reviews by drawing on additional data sources (including nonacademic sources) by considering literature published over a longer time frame and analyzing data in terms of the number of unique digital innovations. Methods We conducted a scoping review of the academic literature published between January 1, 2020, and September 15, 2020, supplemented by a further scoping review of selected nonacademic literature published between January 1, 2020, and October 13, 2020. Both reviews followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) approach. Results A total of 226 academic articles and 406 nonacademic articles were included. The included articles provided evidence of 561 (academic literature) and 497 (nonacademic literature) unique digital innovations. The most common implementation settings for digital innovations were the United States, China, India, and the United Kingdom. Technologies most commonly used by digital innovations were those belonging to the high-level technology group of integrated and ubiquitous fixed and mobile networks. The key public health functions most commonly addressed by digital innovations were communication and collaboration and surveillance and monitoring. Conclusions Digital innovations implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have been wide ranging in terms of their implementation settings, the digital technologies used, and the public health functions addressed. However, evidence gathered through this study also points to a range of barriers that have affected the successful implementation of digital technologies for public health functions.

Hence, an understanding of the critical trends, topics, and research developments in the field is crucial towards facilitating the identification, communication, and improved research collaboration of nascent and increasingly complex environmental problems. As a deeper analysis of the broader trend evolution of ESE research is lacking in the literature, we employ a more robust content analysis approach in the form of a topic modeling computational text analysis method to unearth key temporal and regional insights in the field. As such, we apply a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on abstract metadata based on 3572 articles procured from reputable journals that published subject matter related to ESE research from 2005 to 2019 inclusive. We analyze the statistical composition of each inferred topic in the form of word clouds and uncover general research trends, such as topics related to environmental impact assessments, improved clean cookstoves, solid waste management, and environmental lead pollution. We also perform temporal analysis experiments across each respective journal and observe a high degree of consistency and variance among topic focuses. Moreover, whilst quantifying trends at the regional level, we detect that certain countries display clearly discernible patterns, suggesting that research communities in ESE from various countries tend to focus on different sub-fields. The main contribution of our work is the application of a more refined computer-assisted content analysis method in ESE trend analysis research that can serve as the foundation for future exploratory trend analysis investigations in ESE and other related fields.",2021-10-01,2025-10-16 11:52:12,2025-10-16 11:52:12,,128322,,,317,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Environmental engineering; Environmental science; Latent dirichlet allocation; Research trends; Topic modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frozen storage incurs high-energy consumption for the preservation of food products, whereas cool storage involves the constant threat of bacterial decay. Contemporary cold-chain development in temperature control usually focuses on single logistic chain rather than serving multiple channels. In order to overcome the aforementioned deficiency, this study proposes a time-temperature indicator (TTI) based cold-chain system, which uses wireless sensors for collecting temperature data and implements the formulation of Critical Control Point (CCP) criteria throughout the entire delivery process. In particular, this approach is based on an Internet-of-Things (IoT) architecture as well as international food standards named ISO 22,000. More importantly, four new business models including (1) cold chain home-delivery service; (2) Convenience store (CVS) indirect delivery; (3) CVS direct delivery; (4) flight kitchen service, are successfully developed for conducting performance assessment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can increase annual sales of braised pork rice from 4.44 million bowls to over 6 million bowls, create more distribution channels to increase extra revenue of more than US$6.35 million, and reduce 10% energy consumption in central kitchens to enhance turnover of electricity from US$14.23 raised to US$18.64 per kilowatt hour.",2016-03-01,2025-10-16 11:52:12,2025-10-16 11:52:12,,62-78,,,45,,Computer Standards & Interfaces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold chain; Control charts; Internet of Things; Time–temperature indicator; Wireless sensors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current conceptualizations largely attribute transformation to intentionality, focus on transformation within a single organization, or assign technology the role of a disruptive agent of change. Likewise, “digital” tends to be a general category of technology, rather than a specific technology enacted in a time and place. Inspired by Schatzkian practice theory and its site ontology, we suggest a contextual viewpoint on digital transformation and call it “relational digital transformation.” We analyzed the change dynamics in the context of taxi dispatch practice in Finland, studying the changing taxi dispatch platforms over years. We investigated five powerful industry actors: two incumbents, two entrants, and a federation of taxi entrepreneurs. We identified events of change in the material arrangements in sites and explain the changes through the process dynamics in the focal practice. We define relational digital transformation as a process through which practice-arrangement bundles of digital technologies evolve over time. This approach assumes the default nature of an industry is to be found in the changing relations between entities rather than in entities themselves. This provides a theoretical extension to the prevailing views of digital transformation in IS literature. It enables studying digital transformation in retrospect without attributing change agency to any entities or technologies a priori. We also contribute to practice-theoretical IS literature by demonstrating how the applicability of practice theoretical analysis extends beyond microphenomena to larger industry-level changes.",2020-09-01,2025-10-16 11:52:12,2025-10-16 11:52:12,,101622,,3,29,,The Journal of Strategic Information Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Contextual explanation; Digital platforms; Digital transformation; Mobile apps; Practice theory; Taxi industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its intermittent and stochastic nature presents challenges in achieving optimal performance, reliability, and seamless grid integration. Recent advances in machine intelligence—including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and reinforcement learning (RL)—offer powerful tools to address these challenges across forecasting, control, maintenance, and diagnostics. This systematic review provides a comprehensive evaluation of how machine intelligence has contributed to the optimization of wind energy systems. These techniques have been applied to enhance turbine-level performance, reduce power losses, predict faults, and maximize energy yield under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Particular emphasis is placed on hybrid models that combine data-driven algorithms with physical dynamics and domain heuristics, enabling real-time, predictive, and autonomous wind farm operations. Furthermore, the study critically examines integration barriers such as noisy SCADA data, regulatory compliance, computational costs, and sustainability trade-offs. The findings highlight that multi-objective optimization—balancing energy production, system resilience, and cost efficiency—is central to the most successful implementations.

Although prior research has offered solutions to mitigate freight-related conflicts in the use of space, a deeper understanding of the extent to which those interventions contribute to cities’ sustainable development goals is needed. This paper presents the results of a meta-analysis that examines the effects of four freight curbside interventions: curbside space allocation for freight, data sharing, parking duration limits, and enforcement. The paper pinpoints benefits and drawbacks of those interventions on last-mile deliveries, the urban environment, and the use of public transport infrastructure. The findings suggest positive impacts and underscore the necessity of incorporating people-centred approaches in the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies concerning public space. Nevertheless, trade-offs when implementing those interventions have been identified.

Accordingly, there needs to be clarity of purpose regarding – and reflected through – the language used, the partners engaged, and the proposed ends of any measures to be implemented. These elements sit within specific cultural contexts – both geographical and historical – and it is essential to account for these in translating theory into practice. This article surveys the discourse used across various examples, including a detailed case study. The most significant conclusion is that while data and evidence certainly matter for validation – understanding culture remains key to effective risk analysis and trustworthy risk management because, on the whole, people look for meaning beyond the mere ‘facts’.1A recent exemple of this might be the election of Donald Trump as the President of the United States of America, where despite his detractors being supported by an army of ‘fact-checkers’ and voters being alert to his lies (and personality flaws), still he was elected, on the basis presumably, of what he appeared to stand for, beyond the immediate evidence.1 This applies to risks assumed to be narrowly technical as much as those with a strong social, cultural and political dimension. Insufficient risk analysts and safety experts consider or account for the broader, contextual and cultural factors that impact their choices, analyses and modes of dissemination.2‘Human factors’ analysis tends to focus on individual needs and foibles rather than their wider societal framing.2 This creates a divide between those commissioning and conducting the research and those to whom it is held to apply and needs to be implemented by, which undermines democratic accountability, as well as the possible benefits of, and trust in, their enterprise.",2017-11-01,2025-10-16 11:52:12,2025-10-16 11:52:12,,244-254,,,99,,Safety Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Culture; Engagement; Risk; Strategy; Trust; Values,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach Interviews were undertaken with 18 public accountancy firms, ranked in the Top 30 by fee income, operating in the UK to identify how they are recruiting staff in the light of the Fair Access to the Professions’ agenda. Bourdieusian sociology is used to inform the findings. Findings The Big Four firms employ a discourse of hiring “the brightest and the best” to satisfy perceived client demand, where symbolic capital is instantiated by reputational capital, reflecting prestige and specialisation, supported by a workforce with elite credentials. For mid-tier firms, reputational capital is interpreted as the need for individuals to service a diverse client portfolio. In general, most interviewees demonstrated relatively limited awareness of the issues surrounding the Fair Access agenda. Research limitations/implications The interviews with accountancy firms are both exploratory and cross-sectional. Furthermore, the study was undertaken at an embryonic point (2010) in the emerging Fair Access discourse. Future work considering the accountancy profession could usefully examine if, and how, matters have progressed. Social implications The investigation finds that accountancy firms remain relatively socially exclusive, largely due to the requirement for high educational entry standards, and interviewees’ responses generally indicate only limited attempts at engagement with political agendas of promoting Fair Access to the profession. Originality/value This paper is the first to empirically evaluate how the accountancy profession is responding to the Fair Access agenda; documents changing patterns of recruitment in accountancy employment, including the hiring of non-graduates to undertake professional work; and augments the literature considering social class and accounting.",2017-06-19,2025-10-16 11:52:12,2025-10-16 11:52:12,,1082-1110,,5,30,,"Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Accountancy firm; Accountancy profession; Cultural capital; Fair Access to professions; Recruitment; Social mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first contribution of our review is a new typology of environmental scanning research made up of five discrete research views, which provides a more comprehensive and contemporary overview of the field than previous studies. The second is a proposed agenda for future research that explicitly acknowledges the role of technology, an area that is presently underdeveloped in foundation scanning literature. The third contribution is to signpost future directions for research on scanning and organisational performance using a number of theoretical perspectives.

In this article, I question whether the patchwork of six EU instruments addressing breaches is helping to prevent or mitigate breaches as intended. At a lower level of abstraction, the question concerns appraising the success of each instrument separately. At a higher level of abstraction, since all laws converge on the objective of network and information security – one of the three pillars of the EU cyber security policy – the question is whether the legal ‘patchwork’ is helping to ‘patch’ the underlying insecurity of network and information systems thus contributing to cyber security. To answer the research question, I look at the regulatory framework as a whole, from the perspective of network and information security and consequently I use the expression cyber security breaches. I appraise the regulatory patchwork by using the three goals of notification identified by the European Commission as a benchmark, enriched by policy documents, legal analysis, and academic literature on breaches legislation, and I elaborate my analysis by reasoning on the case of cloud computing. The analysis, which is frustrated by the lack of adequate data, shows that the regulatory framework on cyber security breaches may be failing to provide the necessary level of mutual learning on the functioning of security measures, awareness of both regulatory authorities and the public on how entities fare in protecting data (and the related network and information systems), and enforcing self-improvement of entities dealing with information and services. I conclude with some recommendations addressing the causes, rather than the symptoms, of network and information systems insecurity.",2018-10-01,2025-10-16 11:52:12,2025-10-16 11:52:12,,1077-1098,,5,34,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cloud computing; Cyber security; Data breaches; Data protection; Data security breaches; Network and information security; Security breaches,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A useful shorthand for this connectivity thus becomes DARCP. The problem at the core of this article is that the community has spent millions effectively burying these relationships in PDFs over many decades but must now spend millions more trying to get them back out. The key imperative for this is to increase the flow into structured open databases. The positive impacts will include expanded data mining opportunities for drug discovery and chemical biology. Over the last decade commercial sources have manually extracted DARCP from ≈300,000 documents encompassing ≈7 million compounds interacting with ≈10,000 targets. Over a similar time, the Guide to Pharmacology, BindingDB and ChEMBL have carried out analogues DARCP extractions. Although their expert-curated numbers are lower (i.e., ≈2 million compounds against ≈3700 human proteins), these open sources have the great advantage of being merged within PubChem. Parallel efforts have focused on the extraction of document-to-compound (D-C-only) connectivity. In the absence of molecular mechanism of action (mmoa) annotation, this is of less value but can be automatically extracted. This has been significantly accomplished for patents, (e.g., by IBM, SureChEMBL and WIPO) for over 30 million compounds in PubChem. These have recently been joined by 1.4 million D-C submissions from three major chemistry publishers. In addition, both the European and US PubMed Central portals now add chemistry look-ups from abstracts and full-text papers. However, the fully automated extraction of DARCLP has not yet been achieved. This stands in contrast to the ability of biocurators to discern these relationships in minutes. Unfortunately, no journals have yet instigated a flow of author-specified DARCP directly into open databases. Progress may come from trends such as open science, open access (OA), findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), resource description framework (RDF) and WikiData. However, we will need to await the technical applicability in respect to DARCP capture to see if this opens up connectivity.",2020-01-01,2025-10-16 11:52:12,2025-10-16 11:52:12,,596-606,,,16,,Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,activity data; chemical structures; databases; drug discovery; protein targets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It presents a systematic and critical review of the interdisciplinary literature that addresses the links between the activities of hospitals and medical innovation. It identifies three major research streams: studies of the contribution of medical research and clinical staff to innovation, analyses of novel practices developed and diffused in hospitals, and evolutionary studies of technical change in the context of human health care. This is a highly heterogeneous body of literature, in which comprehensive theoretical frameworks are rare, and empirical studies have tended to focus on a narrow range of hospitals’ innovation activities. The paper introduces and discusses a framework integrating different perspectives that can be used to analyze the functions performed by hospitals at the intersection with different partners in the health innovation system and at different stages of innovation trajectories. On the basis of current gaps in the literature, a research agenda is discussed for a relational and co-evolutionary approach to the study of hospitals as innovators.",2016-10-01,2025-10-16 11:52:19,2025-10-16 11:52:19,,1545-1557,,8,45,,Research Policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Health innovation system; Health-care technology; Hospitals; Medical innovation; User innovator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robo-advisors are comprehensive automated online advisory platforms that help investors in managing wealth by recommending portfolio allocations, which are based on certain algorithms. Design/methodology/approach This is a phenomenological qualitative study that used five focussed group discussions to gather the stipulated information. Purposive sampling was used and the sample comprised investors who actively invest in the Indian stock market. A semi-structured questionnaire and homogeneous discussions were used for this study. Discussion time for all the groups was 203 min. One of the authors moderated the discussions and translated the audio recordings verbatim. Subsequently, content analysis was carried out by using the NVIVO 12 software (QSR International) to derive different themes. Findings Factors such as cost-effectiveness, trust, data security, behavioural biases and sentiments of the investors were observed as crucial points which significantly impacted the perception of the investors. Furthermore, several suggestions on different ways to enhance the awareness levels of investors were brought up by the participants during the discussions. It was observed that some investors perceive robo-advisors as only an alternative for fund/wealth managers/brokers for quantitative analysis. Also, they strongly believe that human intervention is necessary to gauge the emotions of the investors. Hence, at present, robo-advisors for the Indian stock market, act only as a supplementary service rather than a substitute for financial advisors. Research limitations/implications Due to the explorative nature of the study and limited participants, the findings of the study cannot be generalised to the overall population. Future research is imperative to study the dynamic nature of artificial intelligence (AI) theories and investigate whether they are able to capture the sentiments of individual investors and human sentiments impacting the market. Practical implications This study gives an insight into the awareness, perception and opinion of the investors about robo-advisory services. From a managerial perspective, the findings suggest that additional attention needs to be devoted to the adoption and inculcation of AI and machine learning theories while building algorithms or logic to come up with effective models. Many investors expressed discontent with the current design of risk profiles of the investors. This helps to provide feedback for developers and designers of robo-advisors to include advanced and detailed programming to be able to do risk profiling in a more comprehensive and precise manner. Social implications In the future, robo-advisors will change the wealth management scenario. It is well-established that data is the new oil for all businesses in the present times. Technologies such as robo-advisor, need to evolve further in terms of predicting unstructured data, improvising qualitative analysis techniques to include the ability to gauge emotions of investors and markets in real-time. Additionally, the behavioural biases of both the programmers and the investors need to be taken care of simultaneously while designing these automated decision support systems. Originality/value This study fulfils an identified gap in the literature regarding the investors’ perception of new fintech innovation, that is, robo-advisors. It also clarifies the confusion about the awareness level of robo-advisors amongst Indian individual investors by examining their attitudes and by suggesting innovations for future research. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the awareness, perception and attitudes of individual investors towards robo-advisors.",2021-09-29,2025-10-16 11:52:19,2025-10-16 11:52:19,,632-654,,5,13,,Qualitative Research in Financial Markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artificial intelligence; Fintech; Focussed group discussion; G20; G29; Qualitative research; Robo-advisory; Wealth management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, due to the depletion of fossil fuels, it is very difficult to manage the demand requirement of the SAARC regions, which leads to significant power shortage issues. These problems would be resolved through the integration of the substantial amount of renewable energy resources (RERs) that are available in excess in the SAARC regions into the power system networks. This will provide a futuristic roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment in the SAARC region. In this regard, the SAARC region has devised a new plan to transform its smart grid infrastructure into the super smart grid (SSG), which would connect the SAARC countries using the high voltage transmission lines utilizing each country's substantial RERs. To accelerate this ecofriendly effort, the key objective of this review study is to evaluate the potential of the SAARC SSG for demand management and emissions reduction. This study provides a comprehensive overview of SSG technology, covering its technical background, management, power flow improvement techniques, power stability techniques, simulation models, and future steps for development in the SAARC region. First, the regional conflicts, energy deficiency, and potential of the SAARC region have been discussed. Second, a potential architecture of the SAARC SSG has been simulated. Third, a novel Markov chain modeling has been presented for demand management in the SAARC regions. The results and discussions section presents findings from simulations and models. The paper also discusses CO2 reduction techniques, including methods for capturing, storing, and utilizing carbon in biofuel. The study also discusses futuristic optimization techniques in SSG, including blockchain, federated learning, reinforcement learning, the metaverse, digital twin technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The SSG challenges and limitations section summarizes the challenges and limitations faced by SSG. Finally, a roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment for the SAARC power grids has been identified to support the implementation of the futuristic SAARC SSG.

With the scientific consensus pointing to unequivocal human influence on the ecosystem, the issue of how best to manage climate change and ecological sustainability is arguably now a matter for economic, political, policy and planning domains. However, despite the warnings of scientists that ‘business as usual’ economic accumulation is no longer an option, this analysis of international and regional policy suggests that in the main, solutions are proffered that merely shift forms of capital accumulation and enforce ‘business as usual’, rather than providing transformative trajectories to plan for climate change adaptation and mitigation. This article traces key documents from an international level including United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, to EU regional policy, and sectoral policy at a sample national level. This is with a view to providing a theoretical backdrop, and a summary of selected relevant documentation that planners may be required to consider with respect to climate change issues. This article may therefore be considered in part, as a ‘map’ of the policy landscape for planners, highlighting the policy tensions and the conflicts that exist between international, regional and national levels of policymaking. These tensions largely lie between the areas of economic and ecological stability, and usually fail to reconcile contradictions between economic growth and protection of the ecosystem. The article introduces the concept of the ‘techno-finance fix’ to analyse and critique the dominant solutions to climate change. These solutions involve a dovetailing of a hope in emergent, new and not-yet-existing technologies, with a hope that the markets will fund the correct types of technological innovation deemed necessary to mitigate climate change. Therefore, the implications for planning involve an imperative to respond to climate change, and knowledge in the key aspects of climate change policy. However, the response at a planning level depends on which dominant narratives are being forwarded from the top down at a multi-layered policy level. This work therefore suggests that the ‘techno-finance fix’ is a dominant approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and that planning for climate change is thus informed by this dominant narrative, to the marginalising of alternative solutions, including those outside the market or technology.",2018-01-01,2025-10-16 11:52:19,2025-10-16 11:52:19,,1-29,,,119,,Progress in Planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Climate change; Crisis; Economy; Planning; Policy; Techno-finance fix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve their HSE goals, organizations are required to have the processes associated with HSE components designed and developed in a single system. However, the organizations dependence on software becomes evident when macro-level managerial decisions are made based on all the data entered and stored in the organizations’ systems such as procurement, logistics, manufacturing, maintenance, and other related systems all of which might be isolated and separated from each other. These systems may provide a variety of features for organizations, but the lack of integration between them makes it difficult to interact and collaborate with the other processes of the organization. Therefore, the critical point is the integration of these systems in a comprehensive enterprise software. This integration challenge is due to the interdependency and the complexity of the data transmission as well as the relationships among various parts of the organization. To shed some light on the integration complexities this paper is intended to propose an approach to tackle these issues by designing an integrated HSE system with all its processes, features, and connections through an industrial enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. To illustrate the applicability of the system in an industrial context, we conduct a case study of the implementation of this HSE system in the mining industry and closely scrutinize the integration-related challenges faced during this process of software analysis, development and deployment.",2021-01-01,2025-10-16 11:52:19,2025-10-16 11:52:19,,104993,,,133,,Safety Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Enterprise resource planning; HSE; Integration; Safety science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role changes imply identity reconstructions as they do not only require an external legitimacy, but professionals have to internalize a new role script. Thus, this paper aims to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing changes concerning MAs by providing an identity perspective. Design/methodology/approach This paper systematically reviews the literature on the changing role of MAs from an identity perspective, based on a conclusive sample of 64 articles. Findings This review identified several external factors such as professional associations and educational institutions as well as organizational and individual factors that impact MAs’ identity and act as change drivers. MAs’ identity is linked with their image in the public and within the organization and is challenged by increasing demands, conflicting expectations and technological progress. Hence, the literature sample illustrates a fragmented and contradictory picture regarding the changes of MAs’ identities and roles and displays that the idea of a simple movement from one identity to another is misleading. Furthermore, the identity perspective offers new issues for management accounting research, practice and education such as nested identity, multiple or desired identities. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to review the literature of MAs’ changing identities and roles from an identity perspective.

However, despite the relevance of the relationship between engagement and innovation, the literature on the topic appears still fragmented. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the topic through a systematic literature review. Design/methodology/approach A final sample of 108 papers has been selected and analyzed through co-citation and text mining analyses. The former enabled the analysis of the structure of the theoretical foundation of the filed, while the latter facilitated a systematic and unbiased content-driven review of the literature. Findings The results of the analysis indicated two main areas of interest describing the relationship between engagement and innovation. On the one hand, there is the focus on “engagement as an attitude,” intended as the capacity of individuals to generate and realize innovation. On the other hand, there is a stream of literature focused on “engagement as involvement,” which refers to co-innovation paradigms, involving both internal and external stakeholders. Research limitations/implications From an academic perspective, this paper highlights the relevance of the “human-side” of innovation, proposing avenues for future research that dig into the relationship between people's engagement and innovation dynamics. Moreover, it shows how the recent developments in the innovation management literature are coherent with this emerging relevance of the human perspective in innovation. Practical implications From a practitioner’s perspective, this paper helps managers by highlighting the two different approaches that they can have in terms of engagement. The study aims to help them in identifying the kind of engagement they are looking for in their employees and other innovation stakeholder having the support to find relevant studies in that direction. Originality/value The study unveils how the evolution of both areas over the years is strictly related to the megatrends of innovation fields, which are the main areas of knowledge not covered yet. Therefore, a research agenda is proposed.",2020-09-24,2025-10-16 11:52:19,2025-10-16 11:52:19,,1730-1762,,5,24,,European Journal of Innovation Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Attitude; Co-citation; Employees; Engagement; Innovation; Involvement; Systematic literature review; Text mining,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The availability of digitalised hospitals' narrative clinical data offers a potentially rich resource to enhance pharmacovigilance efforts to manage potential safety issues arising from real-world use of drugs. The goal of this paper was to establish a foundation for creating an evaluation corpus by developing a set of annotation guidelines to achieve high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) and to evaluate the performance of basic entity identification tools for drugs, adverse events (AEs) and drug-AE relationships from 100 discharge summaries of a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Two teams of three annotators worked independently on text annotation using Knowtator. Three-way IAA of 86%, 70% and 49% were achieved for drugs, AEs and drug-AE relationships respectively. The performance of the machine algorithm was evaluated against annotations made by at least two annotators, with a recall of 84% and precision of 73% for drugs and a recall of 67% and precision of 53% for AEs. The high recall and precision for drug entity extraction suggests that machine pre-annotation of drugs followed by human annotation of AEs and drug-AE relationships could be a feasible approach in expediting the process of creating a larger evaluation corpus. Non-matches between machine and human annotations were examined to identify ways to further refine the algorithm. When successfully implemented, the identification of ADEs could greatly support pharmacovigilance work in characterising the magnitude and scope of ADEs and prioritising interventions to improve the drug safety.",2016-06-01,2025-10-16 11:52:19,2025-10-16 11:52:19,,37-43,,,4,,Big Data Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adverse drug events; Discharge summaries; Narrative medical reports; Natural language processing; Text mining,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the challenges is the lack of fair approaches to reallocate resources in university library systems. In this context, data envelopment analysis (DEA), a flexible technique that allows the use of multiple inputs and outputs to assess the performance of productive units, may prove useful. In DEA, in addition to the so-called classic models, there are the zero-sum gains (ZSG) models that, when used together, assist in resource allocation. This work aims to develop a powerful approach to help the manager to assess the performance of libraries as well as allow the reallocation of resources within an integrated library system of a university in Brazil. This two-step approach is based on the classic CCR model in the first stage and the ZSG CCR DEA (zero-sum gains data envelopment analysis CCR) model on the next stage, both oriented to inputs. The results show increases in the efficiency of libraries through the redistribution of resources.

Against this backdrop, we introduce data intermediaries and critically examine the DGA's related legal regime by testing its underlying assumptions and highlighting its intrinsic weaknesses and limitations as part of the broader EU data law puzzle. As a result, the paper brings to the fore certain contradictions between DGA's means and ends. Indeed, due to various questionable assumptions, the DGA imposes requirements that not all data intermediaries can satisfy and entrenches a specific techno-organisational form for data intermediation services that may turn out to be economically non-viable. Consequently, one must wonder whether the DGA's rules on data intermediaries are necessary and proportionate in light of the freedom to conduct a business. We furthermore uncover inconsistencies and loopholes between the DGA, the GDPR, the draft Data Act, and the Digital Markets Act. Overall, while the DGA's underlying efforts are laudable, its precise postulations may hinder the achievement of its underlying objectives due to two main factors. First its own internal limitations and incoherences, and, second, uncertainties and tensions resulting from its interplay with the broader EU data law framework.",2023-09-01,2025-10-16 11:52:19,2025-10-16 11:52:19,,105830,,,50,,Computer Law & Security Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Data act; Data governance act; Data intermediaries; Digital markets act; European data economy; General data protection regulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this perspective, MCDA employs structured and traceable protocols to identify potential actions and the criteria for evaluating them. MCDA procedures aim to define recommendations consistent with the preferences of DMs for the specific decision problem at hand. These problems are generally formulated in terms of either choosing the best action, classifying actions into pre-defined and ordered decision classes, or ranking actions from best to worst. As the evaluation criteria are generally conflicting, the main challenge is to aggregate them into a mathematical preference model representing the DM value system. We review the development of MCDA over the past fifty years and describe its evolution with examples of distinctive methods. They are distinguished by the type of preference information elicited by DMs, the type of the preference model (criteria aggregation), and the way of converting the preference relation induced by the preference model in the set of potential actions into a decision recommendation.
